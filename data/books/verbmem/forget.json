[{"prompt": "disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until\n8\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. \"\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus...\"\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know...\" he said heavily.\nProfessor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\"It's -- it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?\nIt's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was\nhe who told you I'd be here, by the way?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\"\n\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.\"\n9\n\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\"\n\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.\"\n\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\nin our world will know his name!\"\n\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\"\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy\ngetting here,", "gt": "Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\"Hagrid's bringing him.\"\n\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\"\nI would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\n\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?\"\nA low rumb"}, {"prompt": "voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n12\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\n13\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\"\nHarry groaned.\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing...\"\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them", "gt": ", and that was where he slept.\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him"}, {"prompt": "and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in\nthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.\n\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\nIt winked.\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\"I get that all the time.\n\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\n20\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\"\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you've never been to Brazil?\"\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE\nWHAT IT'S DOING!\"\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"\n21\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was", "gt": "talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\"\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet"}, {"prompt": "at the front desk.\"\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\nMr. H. Potter\nRoom 17\nRailview Hotel\nCokeworth\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\nWouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled.\n\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. \"\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day.\n32\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.\n\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\"\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n\"I've already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\nUncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately\nagreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\n33\nroom and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\nmost ragged blanket.\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night", "gt": "went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all,"}, {"prompt": "me to go and learn magic.\"\n\"Don't worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\"\n\"But if their house was destroyed --\"\n\"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.\"\n\"Wizards have banks?\"\n\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\"\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \"Goblins?\"\n\"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never\nmess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see.\n\"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\"\n48\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\n\"Flew?\"\n\"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.\"\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\"\n\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked.\n\"Spells -- enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never\nhad so many questions in his life.\n\"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\"'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '\n49\ncourse, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice.\"\n\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\"\n\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.\"\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\nto the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only", "gt": "was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\"\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\"\n\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I'd like a dragon.\" \"You'd like one?\"\n\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go"}, {"prompt": "Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\nCHAPTER SIX\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\nHarry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.\nHalf terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry\nin it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n68\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the\nnight, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall, counting down to September the first.\nOn the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\"Er -- Uncle Vernon?\"\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\"\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\"Thank you.\"\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\"\nHarry didn't say anything. \"Where is this school, anyway?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read.\n69\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\"Platform what?\"\n\"Nine and three-quarters.\"\n\"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\"\n\"It's on my ticket.\"\n\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.\"\n\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\nHarry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.\nThey reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\"Well, there", "gt": "you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\"\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and\n70\nin the middle, nothing at all.\n\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry"}, {"prompt": "And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\n77\n\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded.\n\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"\nHe pointed at Harry's forehead.\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \"So that's where You-Know-Who\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it.\"\n\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly.\n\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\n\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\n\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"\n\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\"\n78\n\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\nbut if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\"\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"\nRon's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\nHarry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\nRon gasped. \"What?\" said Harry.\n\"You said You-Know-Who's name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people --\"\n\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that\nhad been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class.\"\n\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\"\n79\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\"\nHarry, who hadn", "gt": "'t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\nwent pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\nMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble'"}, {"prompt": "to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed\nfull of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\n\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.\"\n\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge\npile of homework the day before.\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,\n107\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\nHedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy\nscrawl:\nDear Harry,\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\nHagrid\nHarry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\n\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\n108\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving\nhere, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the", "gt": "senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\n\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of"}, {"prompt": "Neville.\n\"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.\"\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"\nHagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\n\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner\n111\nstood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\n\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\n\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git.\"\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\n\"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"\nYet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\"\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n112\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\n\"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone", "gt": "had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.\n\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\"\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen,"}, {"prompt": "moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.\n\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!\"\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut\n127\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\n\"Say 'please.\"'\n\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\n\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\"All right -please.\"\n\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\nHarry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\nThey weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\n128\nThey fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\n\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on.\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\n\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.\"\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\nI hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.\nBut", "gt": "Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\n129\nback into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\nCHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day"}, {"prompt": "OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of\nthe head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead\n148\n-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\"\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\n\"Budge up there, move along.\" \"Hagrid!\"\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\n\"Bin watchin' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\"\n\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn't had much to do yet.\"\n\"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.\n\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don't want you attacked before you have to be.\"\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too\n149\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\nHarry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\n\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card!\"\n\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\n\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!\"\n\"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.\n\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\"\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.", "gt": "\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating \"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.\n150\n\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul 'Jordan, I'm warning you --\"\n\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession"}, {"prompt": "him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. Love,\nCharlie\nThey looked at one another.\n\"We've got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked\nas if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's\nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a\ndog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\"\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\n190\ninto a sweat.\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\nHarry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\"\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle.\"\nWhen they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all.\"\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\n191\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid so", "gt": "bbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\"\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corrid"}, {"prompt": "they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\"\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\"\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\n\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming....\"\nRon couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as\n210\nDumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\"\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\n\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\n\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry", "gt": "cut him off.\n\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\n211\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub"}, {"prompt": "tell her to shut her face. What about \"Popkin\" and \"Dinky Diddydums\", can I use them then?'\n    Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control.\n    'So who've you been beating up tonight?' Harry asked, his grin fading. 'Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago - '\n    'He was asking for it,' snarled Dudley.\n    'Oh yeah?'\n    'He cheeked me.'\n    'Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true.'\n    A muscle was twitching in Dudley's jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.\n    They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.\n    Think you're a big man carrying that thing, don't you?' Dudley said after a few seconds.\n    'What thing?'\n    That - that thing you are hiding.'\n    Harry grinned again.\n    'Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time.'\n    Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\n    'You're not allowed,' Dudley said at once. 'I know you're not. You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to.'\n    'How d'you know they haven't changed the rules, Big D?'\n    They haven't,' said Dudley, though he didn't sound completely convinced.\n    Harry laughed softly.\n    'You haven't got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?' Dudley snarled.\n    'Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?'\n    'He was sixteen, for your information,' snarled Dudley, 'and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I'd finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out -\n    'Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry's wand?'\n    'Not this brave at night, are you?' sneered Dudley.\n    'This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this.'\n    'I mean when you're in bed!' Dudley snarled.\n    He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.\n    From the little he could see of Dudley's large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.\n    'What d'you mean, I'm not brave when I'm in bed?' said Harry, Completely nonplussed. 'What am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?'\n    'I heard you last night,' said Dudley breathlessly. Talking in your sleep. Moaning.'\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.\n    Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice.\n   '\"Don't kill Cedric! Don't kill Cedric!\" Who's Cedric - your boyfriend?'\n    'I - you're lying,' said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn't lying - how else would he know about Cedric?\n   '\"Dad! Help me, Dad!", "gt": "He's going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!'' '\n    'Shut up,' said Harry quietly. 'Shut up, Dudley, I'm warning you!'\n   '\"Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He's killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He's going to - \" Don't you point that thing at me!'\n    Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley's heart. Harry could feel fourteen years"}, {"prompt": "sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.\n*\nBut Hedwig didn't return next morning. Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-Flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn't see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he'd perform more illegal magic.\n    So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess; and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.\n    What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. Might he be able to move into Sirius's house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.\n    On the fourth night after Hedwig's departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.\n    'We're going out,' he said.\n    'Sorry?'\n    'We - that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I - are going out.'\n    'Fine,' said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.\n    'You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.'\n    'OK.'\n    'You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.'\n    'Right.'\n    'You are not to steal food from the fridge.'\n    'OK.'\n    'I am going to lock your door.'\n    'You do that.'\n    Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.\n    Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.\n    The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry ay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.\n    Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.\n    He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn't be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn't heard their car.\n    There was silence for a few seconds, then voices.\n    Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feet - but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly", "gt": "not troubling to do so.\n    He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood lacing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment, he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.\n    Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a moment, then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs.\n    His heart shot upwards into his throat"}, {"prompt": "flesh-coloured string.\n    'It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,' said Ron.\n    'Time is Galleons, little brother,' said Fred. 'Anyway, Harry, you're interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,' he added in response to Harry's raised eyebrows, and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing. 'We're trying to hear what's going on downstairs.'\n    'You want to be careful,' said Ron, staring at the Ear, 'if Mum sees one of them again...'\n    'It's worth the risk, that's a major meeting they're having,' said red.\n    The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.\n    'Oh, hello, Harry!' said Ron's younger sister, Ginny, brightly. 'I thought I heard your voice.'\n    Turning to Fred and George, she said, 'Its no-go with the Extendable Ears, she's gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.'\n    'How d'you know?' said George, looking crestfallen.\n    'Tonks told me how to find out,' said Ginny. 'You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can't make contact the door's been Imperturbed. I've been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there's no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.'\n    Fred heaved a deep sigh.\n    'Shame. I really fancied finding out what old Snape's been up to.'\n    'Snape!' said Harry quickly. 'Is he here?'\n    'Yeah,' said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. 'Giving a report. Top secret.'\n    'Git,' said Fred idly\n    'He's on our side now,' said Hermione reprovingly.\n    Ron snorted. 'Doesn't stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees us.'\n    'Bill doesn't like him, either,' said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.\n    Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank on to the bed opposite the others.\n    'Is Bill here?' he asked. 'I thought he was working in Egypt?'\n    'He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,' said Fred. 'He says he misses the tombs, but,' he smirked, 'there are compensations.'\n    'What d'you mean?'\n    'Remember old Fleur Delacour?' said George. 'She's got a job at Gringotts to eemprove 'er Eeenglish -\n    'And Bill's been giving her a lot of private lessons,' sniggered Fred.\n    'Charlie's in the Order, too,' said George, 'but he's still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie's trying to make contacts on his days off.'\n    'Couldn't Percy do that?' Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co-operation at the Ministry of Magic.\n    At Harry's words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.\n    'Whatever you do, don't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,' Ron told Harry in a tense voice.\n    'Why not?'\n    'Because every time Percy's name's mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he's holding and Mum starts crying,' Fred said.\n    'It's been awful,' said Ginny sadly.\n    'I think we're well shot of him,' said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.\n    'What's happened?' Harry said.\n    'Percy and Dad had a row,' said Fred. 'I've never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It's normally Mum who shouts.'\n    'It was the first week back after term ended,' said Ron. '", "gt": "We were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he'd been promoted.'\n    'You're kidding?' said Harry.\n    Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry's impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed it - they all thought Mr Crouch had gone mad).\n    'Yeah"}, {"prompt": "ok, Bill?'\n    'He's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,' said Bill, 'he hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know - '\n    A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words. Fred, George, Ron and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats.\n    '... and then,' choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, 'and then, if you'll believe it, 'e says to me, 'e says,'\"Ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from? 'Cos some son of a Sludger's gone and nicked all mine!\" And I says, \"Nicked all your toads, Will, what next?

'But, you know, Will nicked 'em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn't really doing nothing wrong.'\n    'I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,' said Mrs Weasley coldly.\n    Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of Butterbeer; George was hiccoughing. For some reason, Mrs Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.\n    'Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,' said Sirius in an undertone.\n    'How come he's in the Order?' Harry said, very quietly.\n    'He's useful,' Sirius muttered. 'Knows all the crooks - well, he would, seeing as he's one himself. But he's also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don't. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn't forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.'\n    Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and I he waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something as the jeans had once been Dudley's). As he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation: Mr Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed; Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal; and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling Butterbeer corks for him to chase.\n    'Nearly time for bed, I think,' said Mrs Weasley with a yawn.\n    'Not just yet, Molly,' said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. 'You know, I'm surprised at you. I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.'\n    The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of Dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.\n    'I did!' said Harry indignantly. 'I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we're not allowed in the Order, so - '\n    'And they're quite right,' said Mrs Weasley", "gt": ". 'You're too young.'\n    She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched an its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.\n    'Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?' asked Sirius. 'Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He's got the right to know what's been happen-'\n    'Hang on!' interrupted George loudly.\n    'How come Harry gets his questions answered?' said Fred angrily."}, {"prompt": "NOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE - '\n    The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head. 'You've got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry - and there goes Sirius's mum again.'\n    Mrs Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.\n    George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.\n    Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.\n    The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's.\n    '... smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do...'\n    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.\n    The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.\n    'Kreacher did not see young master,' he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, 'Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.'\n    'Sorry?' said George. 'Didn't catch that last bit.'\n    'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second box to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there its twin, unnataral little beasts they are.'\n    Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.\n    '... and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesn't know...\"\n    This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively. 'Harry Potter.'\n    Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.\n    The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say - '\n    'Don't call her a Mudblood!' said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.\n    'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '\n    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.\n    Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.\n    'Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '\n    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred.\n    'What do you want, anyway?' George asked.\n   ", "gt": "Kreacher's huge eyes darted towards George.\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' he said evasively.\n    'A likely story,' said a voice behind Harry.\n    Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen.\n    At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor."}, {"prompt": "an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of London. Mr Weasley kept anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows.\n    'Four more stops, Harry... Three stops led now... Two stops to go, Harry...'\n    They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic.\n    'Where are we?' said Mr Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, 'Ah yes... this way, Harry,' and led him down a side road.\n    'Sorry,' he said, 'but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact, I've never even used the visitors' entrance before.'\n    The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.\n    'Here we are,' said Mr Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall. 'After you, Harry.'\n    He opened the telephone-box door.\n    Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.\n    'Mr Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,' Harry said.\n    'No, no, I'm sure its fine,' said Mr Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. 'Let's see... six...' he dialled the number, 'two... four... and another four... and another two...'\n    As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them.\n    'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.'\n    'Er...' said Mr Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver. He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, 'Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing...'\n    'Thank you,' said the cool female voice. 'Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.'\n    There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.\n    'Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium '\n    The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering.\n    'The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant", "gt": "day,' said the woman's voice.\n    The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.\n    They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard. The wall's on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds"}, {"prompt": "of frank curiosity.\n    In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed, too, with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudges right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.\n    'Very well,' said Fudge. 'The accused being present - finally - let us begin. Are you ready?' he called down the row.\n    'Yes, sir,' said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.\n    'Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,' said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, 'into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry-James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.\n    'Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley - '\n    'Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,' said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.\n    Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.\n    The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome.\n    A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore's eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.\n    'Ah,' said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. 'Dumbledore. Yes. You - er - got our - er - message that the time and - er - place of the hearing had been changed, then?'\n    'I must have missed it,' said Dumbledore cheerfully. 'However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.'\n    'Yes - well - I suppose we'll need another chair - I - Weasley, could you -?'\n    'Not to worry, not to worry,' said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, out the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.\n    'Yes,' said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. 'Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.'\n    He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read out, The charges against the accused are as follows:\n    That he did knowingly, deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhab", "gt": "ited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on the second of August at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.\n    'You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?' Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment"}, {"prompt": "ieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty. 'Listen - Ron - well done, mate.'\n    The smile faded off Ron's face.\n    'I never thought it would be me!' he said, shaking his head. 'I thought it would be you!'\n    'Nah, I've caused too much trouble,' Harry said, echoing Fred.\n    'Yeah,' said Ron, 'yeah, I suppose... well, we'd better get our trunks packed, hadn't we?'\n    It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect's badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.\n    Mrs Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o'clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.\n    'Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,' she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.\n    Down in the basement Mrs Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read:\nCONGRATULATIONS\nRON AND HERMIONE\nNEW PREFECTS\nShe looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday.\n    'I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny as they entered the room. 'Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron. I've sent them both owls and they're thrilled,' she added, beaming.\n    Fred rolled his eyes.\n    Sirius, Lupin, Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already\n    there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer.\n    'Oh, Alastor, I am glad you're here,' said Mrs Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his travelling cloak. 'We've been wanting to ask you for ages - could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what's inside it? We haven't wanted to open it. just in case it's something really nasty.'\n    'No problem, Molly...'\n    Moody's electric-blue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen.\n    Drawing room...' he growled, as the pupil contracted. 'Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it... yeah, it's a Boggart... want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?'\n    No, no, I'll do it myself later,' beamed Mrs Weasley, 'you have your drink. We're having a little bit of a celebration, actually...' She gestured at the scarlet banner. 'Fourth prefect in the family!' she said fondly, ruffling Ron's hair.\n    'Prefect, eh?' growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin.\n    'Well, congratulations,' said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, 'authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn't have appointed you...'\n    Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother.

He raised his goblet. To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!'\n    Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them"}, {"prompt": "be sympathetic rather than critical.\n    'Here,' she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him,'soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help.'\n    Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, then leapt into his lap and settled down.\n    Thanks,' he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand.\n    'I still reckon you should complain about this,' said Ron in a low voice.\n    'No,' said Harry flatly.\n    'McGonagall would go nuts if she knew - '\n    'Yeah, she probably would,' said Harry dully. 'And how long do you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?'\n    Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he closed it again, defeated.\n    'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice. 'Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in... we've got to do something about her.'\n    'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly.\n    'No... I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, what can we do about that?' said Ron, yawning. \"S too late, isn't it? She's got the job, she's here to stay. Fudge'll make sure of that.'\n    'Well,' said Hermione tentatively. 'You know, I was thinking today...' she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, 'I was thinking that - maybe the time's come when we should just - just do it ourselves.'\n    'Do what ourselves?' said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles.\n    'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione.\n    'Come off it,' groaned Ron. 'You want us to do extra work? D'you realise Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?'\n    'But this is much more important than homework!' said Hermione.\n    Harry and Ron goggled at her.\n    'I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework!' said Ron.\n    'Don't be silly, of course there is,' said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her. 'It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting for us out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year - '\n    'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice. 'I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose - '\n    'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione. 'We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.'\n    'If you're talking about Lupin...' Harry began.\n    'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione. 'He's too busy with the Order and, anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.'\n    'Who, then?' said Harry, frowning at her.\n    Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.\n    'Isn't it obvious?' she said. 'I'm talking about you, Harry.'\n    There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the fire guttered.\n    'About me what?' said Harry.\n    'I'm talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts.'", "gt": "\n    Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.\n    He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, 'That's an idea.'\n    'What's an idea?' said Harry.\n    'You,' said Ron. Teaching us to do it.'\n    'But...'\n    Harry was grinning now,"}, {"prompt": "of Magic,' said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns's lesson. 'She hasn't inspected Binns yet... bet you anything she's there...'\n    But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.\n    'What?'\n    She pointed at the window. Harry looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn't she delivered the letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too.\n    'Oh, I've always loved that owl, she's so beautiful,' Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.\n    He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class's attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly.\n    He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.\n    Only then did he realise that Hedwig's feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.\n    'She's hurt!' Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill. 'Look - there's something wrong with her wing - '\n    Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.\n    'Professor Binns,' said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. 'I'm not feeling well.'\n    Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people.\n    'Not feeling well?' he repeated hazily.\n    'Not at all well,' said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back. 'I think I need to go to the hospital wing.'\n    'Yes,' said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. 'Yes... yes, hospital wing... well, off you go, then, Perkins...'\n    Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns's door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.\n    He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid's cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room. He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.\n    Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked, 'You should be in class, Sonny Jim.'\n    This is urgent,' said Harry curtly.\n    'Ooooh, urgent, is it?' said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice. 'Well, that's put us in our place, hasn't it?'\n    Harry knocked. He heard footsteps, then the door opened and he found himself face to face", "gt": "with Professor McGonagall.\n    'You haven't been given another detention!' she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly.\n    'No, Professor!' said Harry hastily.\n    'Well then, why are you out of class?'\n    'It's urgent, apparently,' said the second gargoyle snidely.\n    'I'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,' Harry explained. 'It's my owl, she's injured.'\n    'Injured owl, did you say?'\n"}, {"prompt": "she's never been hurt on a flight before, has she?'\n    'Who's the letter from, anyway?' asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.\n    'Snuffles,' said Harry quietly.\n    '\"Same time, same place?\" Does he mean the fire in the common room?'\n    'Obviously,' said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked uneasy. 'I just hope nobody else has read this...'\n    'But it was still sealed and everything,' said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her. 'And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn't know where we'd spoken to him before, would they?'\n    T don't know,' said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, 'it wouldn't be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic... and if anyone's watching the Floo Network... but I don't really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted, too!'\n    They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them, lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape's classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.\n    'Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he's always popping in and out of the Ministry... it'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won't it?'\n    'Don't rise,' Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. 'It's what he wants.'\n    'I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron's direction, 'if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance... from what my father says, they've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... and as for Potter... my father says it's a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St Mungo's... apparently they've got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.'\n    Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.\n    Something collided hard with Harry's shoulder, knocking him sideways. A split second later he realised that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.\n    'Neville, no!'\n    Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville's robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.\n    'Help me!' Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville's neck and dragging him backwards, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron seized Neville's arms, and together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Nevilles face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.\n    'Not... funny... don't... Mungo's... show... him...'\n    The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.\n    'Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?' Snape said in his cold, sneering voice. 'Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter", "gt": ", or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.'\n    Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him.\n    'I had to stop you,' Harry gasped, picking up his bag. 'Crabbe and Goyle would've torn you apart.'\n    Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.\n    'What in the name of Merlin,' said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, 'was that about?'\n    Harry did not answer"}, {"prompt": "aking his head. 'Caved in or something.'\n    'Oh...' said Sirius, frowning. 'Well, I'll have a think and get back to - '\n    He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.\n    'Sirius?' said Harry anxiously.\n    But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n    'Why did he -?'\n    Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n    A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.\n    The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.\n- CHAPTER EIGHTEEN -\nDumbledore's Army\n'Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There's no other explanation.'\n    'You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?' he said, outraged.\n    'I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly. 'Watch your frog, it's escaping.'\n    Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table - 'Accio!' - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.\n    Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.\n    'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered. 'I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all - it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? Harry, you're squashing your frog.'\n    Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.\n    'It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione. 'I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silendo.'\n    The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.\n    'If she'd caught Snuffles - '\n    Harry finished the sentence for her.\n   '- He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.' He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.\n    'Silencio!' said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them. 'Well, he mustn't do it again, that's all. I just don't know how we're going to let him know. We can't send him an owl.'\n    'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron. 'He's not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio.'\n    The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.\n    'Silencio. SILENCIO!'\n    The raven caw", "gt": "ed more loudly.\n    'It's the way you're moving your wand,' said Hermione, watching Ron critically, 'you don't want to wave it, it's more a sharp jab.'\n    'Ravens are harder than frogs,' said Ron through clenched teeth.\n    'Fine, let's swap,' said Hermione, seizing Ron's raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. 'Silencio!' The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.\n"}, {"prompt": "Mrs Morris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like 'Weasley is our King'. They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid's chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him. They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door. When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.\n    'Hagrid, it's us!' Harry called through the keyhole.\n    'Shoulda known!' said a gruff voice.\n    They beamed at each other under the Cloak; they could tell by Hagrid's voice that he was pleased. 'Bin home three seconds... out the way, Fang... out the way, yeh dozy dog...'\n    The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open and Hagrid's head appeared in the gap.\n    Hermione screamed.\n    'Merlin's beard, keep it down!' said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. 'Under that Cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!'\n    'I'm sorry!' Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them. 'I just - oh, Hagrid!'\n    'It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!' said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror.\n    Hagrid's hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home: a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it.\n    'What happened to you?' Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces.\n    Told yeh, nuthin',' said Hagrid firmly. 'Want a cuppa?'\n    'Come off it,' said Ron, 'you're in a right state!'\n    'I'm tellin' yeh, I'm fine,' said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. 'Blimey, it's good ter see yeh three again - had good summers, did yeh?'\n    'Hagrid, you've been attacked!' said Ron.\n    'Per the las' time, it's nuthin'!' said Hagrid firmly.\n    'Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?' Ron demanded.\n    'You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,' said Hermione anxiously,'some of those cuts look nasty.'\n    'I'm dealin' with it, all righ?' said Hagrid repressively.\n    He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre.\n    'You're not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?' said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. 'It looks poisonous.'\n    'It's s'posed ter look like that, it's dragon meat,' Hagrid said. 'An' I didn' get it ter eat.'\n    He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he", "gt": "gave a soft moan of satisfaction.\n    'Tha's better. It helps with the stingin', yeh know.'\n    'So, are you going to tell us what's happened to you?' Harry asked.\n    'Can't, Harry. Top secret. More'n me job's worth ter tell yeh that.'\n    'Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?' asked Hermione quietly.\n    Hagrid's fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest.\n"}, {"prompt": "\n    'Ready?' said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. 'Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train 'em.'\n    'And you're sure they're trained, are you?' said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced. 'Only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it?'\n    The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too.\n    'Course they're trained,' said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.\n    'So what happened to your face, then?' demanded Malfoy.\n    'Mind yer own business!' said Hagrid, angrily. 'Now, if yeh've finished askin' stupid questions, follow me!'\n    He turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.\n    They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.\n    'Gather roun', gather roun',' Hagrid encouraged. 'Now, they'll be attracted by the smell o the meat but I'm going ter give em a call anyway, 'cause they'll like ter know it's me.'\n    He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound.\n    Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.\n    A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.\n    A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, 'Why doesn't Hagrid call again?'\n    Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.\n    'Oh, an' here comes another one!' said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. 'Now... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?'\n    Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.\n    'Yeah... yeah, I knew you'd be able", "gt": "ter, Harry,' he said seriously. 'An' you too, Neville, eh? An' - '\n    'Excuse me,' said Malfoy in a sneering voice, 'but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?'\n    For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed"}, {"prompt": "the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark.\n*\nEveryone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others...\n    When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St Mungo's. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts. When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully,\n    that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground.\n    Tonks was very interested in Harry's vision of the attack on Mr Weasley, something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing.\n    There isn't any Seer blood in your family, is there?' she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city.\n    'No,' said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.\n    'No,' said Tonks musingly, 'no, I suppose it's not really prophecy you're doing, is it? I mean, you're not seeing the future, you're seeing the present... it's odd, isn't it? Useful, though...'\n    Harry didn't answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler 'I'llted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him. Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Mad-Eye where St Mungo's was hidden.\n    'Not far from here,' grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. 'Wasn't easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn't have it underground like the Ministry - wouldn't be healthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.'\n    He seized Harry's shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.\n    'Here we go,' said Moody a moment later.\n    They had arrived outside a large,  old-fashioned,  red-brick department store called Purge & Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read: 'Closed for Refurbishment'. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, 'It's never open, that place...'\n    'Right,' said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. 'Every", "gt": "body ready?'\n    They nodded, clustering around her. Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. 'Wotcher,' she said, 'we're here to see Arthur Weasley.'\n    Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers"}, {"prompt": "five minutes... but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that.\n    And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is... and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here...\n    There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them sate over the holidays at least... but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.\n    Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well, her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, 'Running away, are we?'\n    He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.\n    'Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.\n    'I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 'that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.'\n    'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.\n    'Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, 'this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.'\n    Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, 'I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.'\n    Harry span round.\n    'What is it?'\n   '\"Stay where you are.\" '\n    'I haven't moved!' said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. 'So what's the message?'\n    'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. 'Dumbledore says, \"Stay where you are.\" '\n    'Why?' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. 'Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?'\n    'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.\n    Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!\n    'So that's it, is it?' he said loudly.'\"Stay where you are\"? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, loo! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain", "gt": "might not be able to cope with it!'\n    'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 'this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore"}, {"prompt": "would be ashamed of them, you know!'\n    'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.\n    Well, you've got a funny way of showing it!' said Mrs Longbottom. 'My son and his wife,' she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, 'were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who's followers.'\n    Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified.\n    They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on. 'Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?'\n    Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.\n    'Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. 'Very well, Alice dear, very well - Neville, take it, whatever it is.'\n    But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper.\n    'Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.\n    But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum.'\n    His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life.\n    'Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. 'Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.'\n    But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.\n    The door closed behind them.\n    'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful.\n    'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely.\n    'Nor me,' whispered Ginny.\n    They all looked at Harry.\n    'I did,' he said glumly. 'Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone... that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds.'\n    'Bellatrix Lestrange did that?' whispered Hermione, horrified. That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den?'\n    There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice.\n    'Look, I didn't learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!'\n- CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR -\nOcclumency\nKreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard. Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring at him avidly, but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed.\n    Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs Weasley called 'fits of the sullens', in", "gt": "which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time. His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.\n    Harry didn't want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company; in fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge"}, {"prompt": "- ah - frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,' Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, 'for the Order.'\n    It was Sirius's turn to flush. Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry.\n    The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.'\n    'Study what?' said Harry blankly.\n    Snape's sneer became more pronounced.\n    'Occlumency, Potter. The magical defence of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.'\n    Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defence against external penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that...\n    'Why do I have to study Occlu - thing?' he blurted out.\n    'Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly. 'You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'Who's going to be teaching me?'\n    Snape raised an eyebrow.\n    'I am,' he said.\n    Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting.\n    Extra lessons with Snape - what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly round at Sirius for support.\n    'Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?' asked Sirius aggressively. 'Why you?'\n    'I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily. 'I assure you I did not beg for the job.' He got to his feet. 'I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.'\n    He turned to leave, his black travelling cloak billowing behind him.\n    'Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.\n    Snape turned back to face them, sneering.\n    'I am in rather a hurry, Black. Unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time.'\n    'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up. He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. 'If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to.'\n    'How touching,' Snape sneered. 'But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?'\n    'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly.\n    'Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,' Snape said sleekly.\n    Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his wand as he went. Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius's wand-tip to his face.\n    'Sirius!' said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\n    'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '\n    'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?' whispered Snape. 'Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months?'\n    Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he?'\n    'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, 'did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on", "gt": "a safe station platform... gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn't it?'\n    Sirius raised his wand.\n    'NO!' Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them. 'Sirius, don't!'\n    'Are you calling me a coward?' roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.\n    'Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape.\n    'Harry -"}, {"prompt": ".\n    'Potter and Chang!' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. 'Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste... at least Diggory was good-looking!'\n    The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n    'So... where d'you want to go?' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n    'Oh... I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 'Urn... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?'\n    They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, 'By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n    It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters,'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere...'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. 'Yeah, that is weird.\n    He wasn't sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. The) had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them... it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n    The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed. Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck.\n    'Um... d'you want to get a coffee?' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around. 'Where?'\n    'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbndge's office.\n    'Cute, isn't it?' said Cho happily.\n    'Er... yeah,' said Harry untruthfully.\n    'Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day!' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n    'Aaah...'\n    They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that t was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n    'What can I get you, m'dears?' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty.\n    Two coffees, please,' said Cho.\n    In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished", "gt": "they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.\n    After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and"}, {"prompt": "d u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?'\n    Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies's girlfriend had even unglued herself to look round at Cho crying.\n    'Well - I have talked about it,' Harry said in a whisper, 'to Ron and Hermione, but - '\n    'Oh, you'll talk to Hermione Granger!' she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears. Several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. 'But you won't talk to me! P - perhaps it would be best if we just... just p - paid and you went and met up with Hermione G - Granger, like you obviously want to!'\n    Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it.\n    'Cho?' he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho.\n    'Go on, leave!' she said, now crying into the napkin. 'I don't know why you asked me out in the first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me... how many ere you meeting after Hermione?'\n    'It's not like that!' said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake.\n    Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now.\n    'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.\n    'Cho!' Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.\n    There was total silence within the teashop. Every eye was on?larry. He threw a Galleon down on to the table, shook pink confetti out of his hair, and followed Cho out of the door.\n    It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen, he simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.\n    'Women!' he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. 'What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?'\n    He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.\n    'Hi, Hagrid!' he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.\n    Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.\n    'Oh, it's yeh, Harry,' said Hagrid. 'Yeh all righ?'\n    'Yeah, I'm fine,' lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he didn't really have much to complain about. 'Er - are you OK?'\n    'Me?' said Hagrid. 'Oh yeah, I'm grand, Harry, grand.'\n    He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry didn't know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, 'In the same boat, yeh an' me, aren' we, 'Any?'\n    'Er -'said Harry.\n    'Yeah... I've said it before... both outsiders, like,' said Hagrid, nodding wisely. 'An' both orphans. Yeah... both orphans", "gt": ".'\n    He took a great swig from his tankard.\n    'Makes a diff'rence, havin' a decent family,' he said. 'Me dad was decent. An' your mum an' dad were decent. If they'd lived, life woulda bin diff'rent, eh?'\n    'Yeah... I s'pose,' said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.\n    'Family,' said Hagrid gloomily. 'Whatever yeh say, blood's important..."}, {"prompt": ",' said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, 'How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?'\n    'He feels angry, of course,' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. 'Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him.'\n    'So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back?' said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. 'You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore'5 been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?'\n    'I wasn't the sole witness,' snarled Harry. There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?'\n    'I'd love them,' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. 'A great bold headline: \"Potter Accuses...\" A sub-heading, \"Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us\". And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you, \"Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who's attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters...\" '\n    The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died.\n    'But of course,' she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, 'Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she?'\n    'As a matter of fact,' said Hermione sweetly, 'that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.'\n    Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang 'Weasley is our King' dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.\n    'You want me to report what he says about He Who Must Not Be Named?' Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    'Yes, I do,' said Hermione. 'The true story. All the facts. Exactly a; Harry reports them. He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh, get a grip on yourself,' she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemort's name, Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself.\n    Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, The Prophet wouldn't print it. In case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he's delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle - '\n    'We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles!' said Hermione angrily. 'We've had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!'\n    There's no market for a story like that,' said Rita coldly.\n    'You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,' said Hermione irritably.\n    Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, 'All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It's against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don't want to believe You-Know-Who's back.'\n    'So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?' said Hermione scathingly.\n    Rita sat up straight again, her", "gt": "eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,\n    The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly\n    'My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eye;. 'He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn't care about making money.'\n    Rita looked disparagingly at Luna"}, {"prompt": ", 'haven't they gloated enough?'\n    A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.\n    'Oh, let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,' said Hermione.\n'Weasley can save anything,\nHe never leaves a single ring,\nThat's why Gryffindors all sing:\nWeasley is our King.'\n'Hermione...' said Harry slowly.\n    The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders.\n'Weasley is our King,\nWeasley is our King,\nHe didn't let the Quaffle in,\nWeasley is our King...'\n'No?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    'YES!' said Harry loudly.\n    'HARRY! HERMIONE!' yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. 'WE DID IT! WE WON!'\n    They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of 'Weasley is our King' died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.\n    'We'll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?' said Harry 'Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily. 'I'm not in any hurry.' They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE -\nOWLs\nRon's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\n    They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\n    'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his right, I mean - and - well - you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest\n    to them - a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepulis - had heard him. 'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later - What?' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. 'Why are you grinning?'\n    'I", "gt": "'m not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 'I'm just glad we won, that's all.'\n    'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'\n"}, {"prompt": ", then ar hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the: ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.\n    As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.\n    Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.\n    He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus's position. Jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.\n    He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.\n    Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.\n    He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.\n    Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.\n    Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,' he said softly.\n    Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin.\n    'Ahem - twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty.\n    Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.\n    There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried 'Ouch!' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below.\n    Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.\n    'No!' cried Hermione.\n    'My dear!' said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice. This is an examination!'\n    But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more. Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him; he was still", "gt": "upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, 'Be reasonable, Hagrid!'\n    Hagrid roared, 'Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish!'\n    Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bod"}, {"prompt": "'You've dreamed about the place, that's all.'\n    'They're not normal dreams!' Harry shouted in her face, standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her. 'How d'you explain Ron's dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him?'\n    'He's got a point,' said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione.\n    'But this is just - just so unlikely!' said Hermione desperately. 'Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he's been in Grimmauld Place all the time?'\n    'Sirius might've cracked and just wanted some fresh air,' said Ron, sounding worried. 'He's been desperate to get out of that house for ages - '\n    'But why,' Hermione persisted, 'why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?'\n    'I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!' Harry yelled at her. 'Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn't care about seeing hurt - '\n    'You know what, I've just thought of something,' said Ron in a hushed voice. 'Sirius's brother was a Death Eater, wasn't he? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!'\n    'Yeah - and that's why Dumbledore's been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time!' said Harry.\n    'Look, I'm sorry,' cried Hermione, 'but neither of you is making sense, and we've got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there - '\n    'Hermione, Harry's seen them!' said Ron, rounding on her.\n    'OK,' she said, looking frightened yet determined, 'I've just got to say this - '\n    'What?'\n    'You... this isn't a criticism, Harry! But you do... sort of... I mean - don't you think you've got a bit of a - a - saving-people thing?' she said.\n    He glared at her.\n    'And what's that supposed to mean, a \"saving-people thing\"?'\n    'Well... you...' she looked more apprehensive than ever. 'I mean... last year, for instance... in the lake... during the Tournament... you shouldn't have... I mean, you didn't need to save that little Delacour girl... you got a bit... carried away...'\n    A wave of not, prickly anger swept through Harry's body; now could she remind him of that blunder now?\n    'I mean, it was really great of you and everything,' said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry's face, 'everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do -\n    That's funny,' said Harry through gritted teeth, 'because I definitely remember Ron saying I'd wasted time acting the hero... is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?'\n    'No, no, no!' said Hermione, looking aghast.

He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it's the kind of thing he does, he knows you're the - the sort of person who'd go to Sirius's aid! What if he's just trying to get you into the Department of Myst -?'\n    'Hermione, it doesn't matter if he's done it to get me there or not - they've taken McGonagall to St Mungo's, there isn't anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don't go, Sirius is dead!'\n    'But Harry - what if your dream was - was just that, a dream?'\n    Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back from him, looking alarmed", "gt": ".\n    'You don't get it!' Harry shouted at her, 'I'm not having nightmares, I'm not just dreaming! What d'you think all the Occlumency was for, why d'you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things? Because they're REAL, Hermione - Sirius is trapped, I've seen him.

They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?\n    'Is it those mad horse things?' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. 'Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'How many?'\n    'Just two.'\n    'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\n    'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling.\n    'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting.\n    'Don't be stupid, we can't all go!' said Harry angrily. 'Look, you three -'he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, 'you're not involved in this, you're not - '\n    They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.\n    'OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, 'but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able - '\n    'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.\n    'What makes you think that?'\n    'Because, in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,' she said coolly, 'and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That's probably why these two turned up in the first place.'\n    Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood.\n    'OK, then,' he said, a bright idea occurring, 'Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more Thestrals - '\n    'I'm not staying behind!' said Hermione furiously.\n    There's no need,' said Luna, smiling. 'Look, here come more now... you two must really smell...'\n    Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.\n    'All right,' he said angrily, 'pick one and get on, then.'\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR -\nThe Department\nOf Mysteries\nHarry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.\n    He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring.\n    'What?' he said.\n    'How're we supposed to get on?' said Ron faintly. 'When we can't see the things?'\n    'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny. 'Come here...'\n    She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to g", "gt": "rip tightly before she got back on to her own steed.\n    This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horses neck. 'Mad... if I could just see it - '\n    'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly. 'We all ready, then?'\n    They all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.\n    'OK...'\n    He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed.\n    '"}, {"prompt": "from this door.'\n    They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut.\n    'Stand aside!' said a rough voice. 'Alohomora!'\n    As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.\n    They might've run straight through to the hall,' said the rough voice.\n    'Check under the desks,' said another.\n    Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his wand out from under the desk, he shouted, 'STUPEFY!'\n    A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim.\n    'Avada -'\n    Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried:\n    'EXPELLIARMUS!'\n    Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done.\n    'Get out of the way, Harry!' yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage.\n    Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted:\n    'STUPEFY!'\n    The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered - '\n    The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his mask had slipped so that he couldn't see. He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted: 'STUP-'\n    'STUPEFY!' screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest: he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.\n    'Accio wand!' cried Hermione. Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him.\n    'Thanks,' he said. 'Right, let's get out of - '\n    'Look out!' said Neville, horrified. He was staring at the Deati Eater's head in the bell jar.\n    All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, open-mouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head.\n    It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz...\n    A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again; thick black", "gt": "hair was sprouting frori the pate and chin...\n    'It's Time,' said Hermione in an awestruck voice. Time...'\n    The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more...\n    There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.\n    'RON?' Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. 'GINNY? LUNA?'\n    '"}, {"prompt": ", but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.'\n    'I know,' said Harry wearily.\n    'And this ability of yours - to detect Voldemort's presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.'\n    Harry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.\n    'More recently,' said Dumbledore, 'I became concerned that Voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr Weasley'\n    'Yeah, Snape told me,' Harry muttered.\n    'Professor Snape, Harry' Dumbledore corrected him quietly. 'But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?'\n    Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired.\n    'Yeah,' Harry mumbled. 'Yeah, I wondered.'\n    'You see,' Dumbledore continued, 'I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realised that our relationship was - or had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes...'\n    Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, in those moments when he and Dumbledore had made eye-contact.\n    'Voldemort's aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him. So you see, I have been trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you, Harry. An old man s mistake...\"\n    He sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius; none of it mattered...\n    'Sirius told me you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley's attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort had realised he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.'\n    He paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore's desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore's explanation; he could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned...\n    'Professor Snape discovered,' Dumbledore resumed, 'that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body; and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not <now what it meant.\n    'And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prop", "gt": "hecies held in the Ministry of Magic are\n    heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lilt them from the shelves without suffering madness: in this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic, and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.'\n    'But I didn't,' muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him: a confession must surely rel"}, {"prompt": "ing that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning...\n    'It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. 'But it won't be long now\n    'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.\n    Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight.\n    'What's - er - going on with you and her, anyway?' Ron asked quietly.\n    'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully.\n    'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively.\n    Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days... the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.\n    'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully. 'I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.'\n    'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'Who's she with now, anyway?' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.\n    'Michael Corner,' she said.\n    'Michael - but -'said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. 'But you were going out with him!'\n    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely. 'He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.\n    'Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle. 'Good for you. Just choose someone - better - next time.\n    He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.\n    'Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?' asked Ginny vaguely.\n    'WHAT?' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.\n    As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.\n    When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all.\n    There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers.", "gt": "At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.\n    'Ron, Ginny!' called Mrs Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly. 'Oh, and Harry dear - how are you?'\n    'Fine,' lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes."}, {"prompt": "m sure Harry'd say the same, wouldn't you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better flier!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Must be nearly time,\" said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again. \"Do you know whether we're waiting for any more, Amos?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn't get tickets,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"There aren't any more of us in this area, are there?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not that I know of,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Yes, it's a minute off...

It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now... nine people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting....\n\u3000\u3000\"Three...\" muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, two... one...\"\n\u3000\u3000It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then -His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,\" said a voice.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVEN - BAGMAN AND CROUCH\n\u3000\u3000Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly:\n\u3000\u3000The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\n\u3000\u3000\"Morning, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello there, Arthur,\" said Basil wearily. \"Not on duty, eh? It's all right for\n\u3000\u3000some.... We've been here all night.... You'd better get out of the way, we've got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I'll find your campsite.... Weasley... Weasley....\" He consulted his parchment list. \"About a quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to.

After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They", "gt": "said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.\n\u3000\u3000A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.

It wasn't Dobby - it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did sir just call me Dobby?\" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf - that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry,\" Harry told the elf, \"I just thought you were someone I knew.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But I knows Dobby too, sir!\" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \"My name is Winky, sir - and you, sir -\" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry's scar. \"You is surely Harry Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\" s he said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"How is he?\" said Harry. \"How's freedom suiting him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, sir,\" said Winky, shaking her head, \"ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"What's wrong with him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir, \" said Winky sadly. \"Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why not?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well - why shouldn't he be paid?\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.\n\u3000\u3000\"House-elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House-elves does what they is told.

He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.\"\n\u3000\u3000She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again.\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned back to the others.\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's a house-elf?\" Ron muttered. \"Weird things, aren't", "gt": "they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby was weirder,\" said Harry fervently.\n\u3000\u3000Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wild!\" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side.

The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Foul!\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.\n\u3000\u3000\"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran -deliberately flying to collide there - and it's got to be another penalty - yes, there's the whistle!\"\n\u3000\u3000The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -\"\n\u3000\u3000And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as\n\u3000\u3000the Quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Levski - Dimitrov - Moran - Troy - Mullet - Ivanova - Moran again - Moran - MORAN SCORES!\"\n\u3000\u3000But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members' wands", "gt": ", and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov -The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face.\n\u3000\u3000There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum's nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle. He had become distracted"}, {"prompt": "ts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's sick,\" Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side.\n\u3000\u3000\"That is really sick....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to help the Ministry!\" Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. \"You lot - get into the woods, and stick together. I'll come and fetch you when we've sorted this out!\"\n\u3000\u3000Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" said Fred, grabbing Ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the wood.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.\n\u3000\u3000The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her. \"Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid - lumos!\"\n\u3000\u3000She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tripped over a tree root,\" he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, with feet that size, hard not to,\" said a drawling voice from behind them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.\n\u3000\u3000Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Language, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. \"Hadn't you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn't like her spotted, would you?\"\n\u3000\u3000He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that supposed to mean?\" said Hermione defiantly. \"Granger, they're after Muggles, \"said Malfoy. \"D'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around... they're moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione's a witch,\" Harry snarled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have it your own way, Potter,\" said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \"If you think they can't spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You watch your mouth!\" shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \"Mudblood\" was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Never mind, Ron,\" said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron's arm to rest", "gt": "rain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Scare easily, don't they?\" he said lazily. \"I suppose your daddy told you all to hide?\n\u3000\u3000What's he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where're your parents?\" said Harry, his temper rising. \"Out there wearing masks"}, {"prompt": "\u3000\"Voldemort's - \"Harry, come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of them\n\u3000\u3000started across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Without pausing to think, he yelled, \"DUCK!\"\n\u3000\u3000He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness-- \"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That's my son!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron - Harry\" - his voice sounded shaky - \"Hermione - are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Out of the way, Arthur,\" said a cold, curt voice.\n\u3000\u3000It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch's face was taut with rage.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which of you did it?\" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \"Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't do that!\" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't do anything!\" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \"What did you want to attack us for?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do not lie, sir!\" shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad. \"You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Barty,\" whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, \"they're kids, Barty, they'd never have been able to \"Where did the Mark come from, you three?\" said Mr. Weasley quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Over there,\" said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. \"There was someone behind the trees... they shouted words - an incantation -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, stood over there, did they?\" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. \"Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -\"\n\u3000\u3000But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're too late,\" said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. \"They'll have Disapparated.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so,\" said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric's father. \"Our Stunners went right through those trees.... There's a good chance we got them...\n\u3000\u3000\"Amos, be careful!\" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.\n\u3000\u3000A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes! We got them!", "gt": "There's someone here! Unconscious! It's - but - blimey..\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got someone?\" shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. \"Who? Who is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms.\n\u3000\u3000Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.\n\u3000\u3000Mr"}, {"prompt": ".\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so silly,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"You've got to have dress robes, they're on your list! I got some for Harry too... show him, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn't as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn't have any lace on them at all - in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they're okay!\" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry's robes. \"Why couldn't I have some like that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because... well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn't a lot of choice!\"\n\u3000\u3000said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm never wearing them,\" Ron was saying stubbornly. \"Never.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him.\n\u3000\u3000Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why is everything I own rubbish?\" said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon's beak.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ELEVEN - ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS\n\u3000\u3000There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur!\" she called up the staircase. \"Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers - \"I've got a quill here somewhere!\" - and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to -Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\n\u3000\u3000Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d'you-call-'ems - please-men. Arthur, you've got to get over there --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here!\" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\" said Mr. Diggory's head. \"I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does Mad-Eye say happened?\" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head rolled its eyes. \"Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.\"\n", "gt": "\u3000\u3000\"What did the dustbins do?\" asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,\" said Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Diggory. \"Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about the intruder?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,\" said Mr. Diggory'"}, {"prompt": "the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWELVE - THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\n\u3000\u3000Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey,\" said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, \"if that keeps up the lake's going to overflow. I'm soak - ARRGH!\"\n\u3000\u3000A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron's head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped - narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.\n\u3000\u3000\"PEEVES!\" yelled an angry voice. \"Peeves, come down here at ONCE!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch - sorry, Miss Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's all right, Professor!\" Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peeves, get down here NOW!\" barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat\n\u3000\u3000and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not doing nothing!\" cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. \"Already wet, aren't they? Little squirts!\n\u3000\u3000Wheeeeeeeeee!\" And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.\n\u3000\u3000\"I shall call the headmaster!\" shouted Professor McGonagall. \"I'm warning you, Peeves -\"\n\u3000\u3000Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, move along, then!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Into the Great Hall, come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.\n\u3000\u3000The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast.\n\u3000\u3000Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the", "gt": "Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good evening,\" he said, beaming at them."}, {"prompt": "letter to it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just find him, all right?\" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \"Before the dementors do.\"\n\u3000\u3000She nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a lie, Harry,\" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \"You didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So what?\" said Harry. \"He's not going back to Azkaban because of me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Drop it,\" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.\n\u3000\u3000Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session.\n\u3000\u3000On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody's Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\u3000\u3000To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - but you said it's illegal, Professor,\" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \"You said - to use it against another human was -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\" said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \"If you'd rather learn the hard way - when someone's putting it on you so they can control you completely - fine by me. You're excused. Off you go.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.\n\u3000\u3000Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them.\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem.\n\u3000\u3000Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter,\" Moody growled, \"you next.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, '1mperio!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk... jump onto the desk...\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\n\u3000\u3000Jump onto the desk....\n\u3000\u3000Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.\n\u3000\u3000Stupid thing to do", "gt": ", really, said the voice.\n\u3000\u3000Jump onto the desk....\n\u3000\u3000No, I don't think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly... no, I don't really want to.\n\u3000\u3000Jump! NOW!\n\u3000\u3000The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping - the result was that he'd smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.\n"}, {"prompt": "you know, you can tell me the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't put my name in that goblet!\" said Harry, starting to feel angry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, okay,\" said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. \"Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you.... I'm not stupid, you know.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're doing a really good impression of it,\" Harry snapped.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah?\" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now.\n\u3000\u3000\"You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER EIGHTEEN - THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS\n\u3000\u3000When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him - only to find that Ron's bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. \"I brought you this.... Want to go for a walk?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good idea,\" said Harry gratefully.\n\u3000\u3000They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself,\" she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. \"The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody's right, Harry... I don't think any student could have done it... they'd never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore's -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you seen Ron?\" Harry interrupted.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione hesitated.\n\u3000\u3000\"Erm... yes... he was at breakfast,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Does he still think I entered myself?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... no, I don't think so... not really,\" said Hermione awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that supposed to mean, 'not really'?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Harry, isn't it obvious?\" Hermione said despairingly. \"He's jealous!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jealous?\" Harry said incredulously. \"Jealous of what? He wants to make a", "gt": "prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" said Hermione patiently, \"it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it's not your fault,\" she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. \"I know you don't ask for it... but - well - you know, Ron's got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you're his best friend, and you're really famous - he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he"}, {"prompt": "to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick's class that he was given extra homework - the only person to get any, apart from Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's really not that difficult, Harry,\" Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick's class - she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. \"You just weren't concentrating properly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder why that was,\" said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. \"Still - never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon...\"\n\u3000\u3000Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday's worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning \"ignore them, ignore them, ignore them\" under her breath, and he couldn't see why today should be any better.\n\u3000\u3000When he and Hermione arrived at Snape's dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges - then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:\n\u3000\u3000SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY-- THE REAL HOGWARTS CHAMPION!\n\u3000\u3000\"Like them, Potter?\" said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. \"And this isn't all they do - look!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green:\n\u3000\u3000POTTER STINKS!\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh very funny,\" Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, \"really witty.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn't laughing, but he wasn't sticking up for Harry either.\n\u3000\u3000\"Want one, Granger?\" said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. \"I've got loads. But don't touch my hand, now. I've just washed it, you see; don't want a Mudblood sliming it up.\"\n\u3000\u3000Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he'd thought what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Hermione said warningly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, then, Potter,\" Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. \"Moody's not here to look after you now - do it, if you've got the guts -\"\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, they looked into each other's eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Funnunculus!\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Densaugeo!\" screamed Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles -- Harry's hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy's hit Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were spring", "gt": "ing up -Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face. It wasn't a pretty sight.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's front teeth - already larger than average - were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin - panic-stricken"}, {"prompt": "\n\u3000\u3000\"Good luck, Harry,\" Hermione whispered. \"You'll be fine!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.\n\u3000\u3000He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn't seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps\n\u3000\u3000and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, don't panic,\" she said, \"just keep a cool head.... We've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand.... The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you.... Are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" Harry heard himself say. \"Yes, I'm fine.\"\n\u3000\u3000She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're to go in here with the other champions,\" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \"and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there... he'll be telling you the - the procedure.... Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.\n\u3000\u3000Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn't look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Good-o!\" said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \"Come in, come in, make yourself at home!\"\n\u3000\u3000Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, now we're all here - time to fill you in!\" said Bagman brightly. \"When the audience has assembled, I'm going to be offering each of you this bag\" - he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - \"from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different - er - varieties, you see.\n\u3000\u3000And I have to tell you something else too... ah, yes... your task is to collect the golden egg!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman's words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn't reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this..\n\u3000\u3000And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking.... Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then - it seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ladies first,\" he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\n\u3000\u3000She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.\n\u3000\u3000The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number", "gt": "one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you are!\" said Bagman. \"You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see?\n\u3000\u3000Now, I'm going to have to leave you in a moment, because I"}, {"prompt": "good lord, I thought she'd had it then!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more.... Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur's marks were being shown... more clapping... then, for the third time, the whistle.\n\u3000\u3000\"And here comes Mr. Krum!\" cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.\n\u3000\u3000He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear... yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very daring!\" Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \"That's some nerve he's showing - and - yes, he's got the egg!\"\n\u3000\u3000Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished - it would be Harry's turn any moment.\n\u3000\u3000He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited.\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.\n\u3000\u3000He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn't know or care. It was time to do\n\u3000\u3000what he had to do... to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance.\n\u3000\u3000He raised his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Accio Firebolt!\" he shouted.\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying.... If it hadn't worked... if it wasn't coming... He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely....\n\u3000\u3000And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise.... Bagman was shouting something... but Harry's ears were not working properly anymore... listening wasn't important....\n\u3000\u3000He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened....\n\u3000\u3000As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd's faces became mere flesh-colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear.... He was back where he belonged....\n\u3000\u3000This was just another Quidditch match, that was all... just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team.\n\u3000\u3000He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon's front legs. \"Okay,\" Harry told himself, \"diversionary tactics... let's go...\"\n\u3000\u3000He dived. The Horntail's head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away... but Harry didn't care", "gt": "... that was no more than dodging a Bludger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Great Scott, he can fly!\" yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. \"Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his progress; its head revolving on its long neck - if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy - but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again - Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth"}, {"prompt": "a last resort!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls' staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, \"well - that just proves - completely missed the point -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now - but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR - RITA SKEETER'S SCOOP\n\u3000\u3000Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione's hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion on it for the ball, \"but it's way too much bother to do every day,\" she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their\n\u3000\u3000argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn't seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I thought he must be,\" she said, shrugging. \"I knew he couldn't be pure giant because they're about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants.\n\u3000\u3000They can't all be horrible.... It's the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves.... It's just bigotry, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn't want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn't looking.\n\u3000\u3000It was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over -everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.\n\u3000\u3000The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn't done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room - though he hadn't really expected that to help.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn't need that sort of rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.\n\u3000\u3000Snow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn't see out of them in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to", "gt": "Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid's cabin would catch fire.\n\u3000\u3000When they arrived at Hagrid's cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,\" she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow."}, {"prompt": ". \"Open up!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid didn't answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn't open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's he avoiding us for?\" Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school. \"He surely doesn't think we'd care about him being half-giant?\"\n\u3000\u3000But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn't see a sign of him all week. He didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.\n\u3000\u3000\"Missing your half-breed pal?\" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation. \"Missing the elephant-man?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just thought you'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really get to work on that egg.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh I - I reckon I've got a pretty good idea what it's about now,\" Harry lied.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you really?\" said Hermione, looking impressed. \"Well done!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages... whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's mad!\" said Harry, staring at Krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \"It must be freezing, it's January!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a lot colder where he comes from,\" said Hermione. \"I suppose it feels quite warm to him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but there's still the giant squid,\" said Ron. He didn't sound anxious - if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's really nice, you know,\" she said. \"He's not at all like you'd think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron said nothing. He hadn't mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\n\u3000\u3000The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn't there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Doesn't he ever go into the office?\" Hermione whispered suddenly. \"Look!\"\n\u3000\u3000She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.\n\u3000\u3000It was indeed", "gt": "odd. Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.\n\u3000\u3000\"In a moment, in a moment!\" Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry"}, {"prompt": "in a very low voice), \"I feel very bad about all this..\n\u3000\u3000. you were thrown into this tournament, you didn't volunteer for it... and if...\" (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) \"if I can help at all... a prod in the right direction... I've taken a liking to you... the way you got past that dragon!... well, just say the word.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared up into Bagman's round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're supposed to work out the clues alone, aren't we?\" he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... well, yes,\" said Bagman impatiently, \"but - come on. Harry - we all want a Hogwarts victory, don't we?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you offered Cedric help?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000The smallest of frowns creased Bagman's smooth face. \"No, I haven't,\" he said. \"I -well, like I say, I've taken a liking to you. Just thought I'd offer...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, thanks,\" said Harry, \"but I think I'm nearly there with the egg... couple more days should crack it.\"\n\u3000\u3000He wasn't entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman's help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like\n\u3000\u3000cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman looked almost affronted, but couldn't say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Mr. Bagman,\" said Fred brightly. \"Can we buy you a drink?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... no,\" said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, \"no, thank you, boys...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I must dash,\" he said. \"Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000He hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did he want?\" Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.\n\u3000\u3000\"He offered to help me with the golden egg,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"He shouldn't be doing that!\" said Hermione, looking very shocked. \"He's one of the judges! And anyway, you've already worked it out - haven't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... nearly,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I don't think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!\" said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. \"I hope he's trying to help Cedric as much!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not, I asked,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who cares if Diggorys getting help?\" said Ron. Harry privately agreed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Those goblins didn't look very friendly,\" said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer. \"What were they doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,\" said Harry. \"He's still ill. Hasn't been into work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe Percys poisoning him,\" said Ron. \"Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he'll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione gave Ron a don't-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said, \"Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch.... They'd normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though,\" said Harry. \"Maybe they need an interpreter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Worrying about poor 'ickle goblins, now, are you?\" Ron asked Hermione. \"Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly", "gt": "Goblins?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha, ha, ha,\" said Hermione sarcastically. \"Goblins don't need protection. Haven't you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry and Ron together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the/re quite capable of dealing with wizards,\" said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer. \"They're very clever. They're not like house-elves, who never stick up for themselves.\"\n\u3000"}, {"prompt": "her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I'll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,\" said Ron nervously. \"I'm serious, Hermione, she'll dig up something on you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My parents don't read the Daily Prophet. She can't scare me into hiding!\" said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. \"And Hagrid isn't hiding anymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Breaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid's cabin.\n\u3000\u3000The curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they approached.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. \"Hagrid, that's enough! We know you're in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can't let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you're just being -\"\n\u3000\u3000The door opened. Hermione said, \"About t-!\" and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good afternoon,\" he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"We-er-we wanted to see Hagrid,\" said Hermione in a rather small voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I surmised as much,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Why don't you come in?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh... um... okay,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000She, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Hagrid,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid looked up.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Lo,\" he said in a very hoarse voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"More tea, I think,\" said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, \"Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, \"Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course we still want to know you!\" Harry said, staring at Hagrid. \"You don't think\n\u3000\u3000anything that Skeeter cow - sorry, Professor,\" he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have gone temporarily deaf and haven't any idea what you said. Harry,\" said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er-right,\" said Harry sheepishly. \"I just meant-Hagrid, how could you think we'd care what that-woman-wrote about you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Two fat tears leaked out of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Living proof of what I've been telling you, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. \"I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here,", "gt": "telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not all of 'em,\" said Hagrid hoarsely. \"Not all of 'em wan me ter stay.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. \"Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven"}, {"prompt": "... tell him what Peeves was up to....\"\n\u3000\u3000A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step.\n\u3000\u3000\"Close shave. Potter,\" he muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... I - er... thanks,\" said Harry weakly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is this thing?\" said Moody, drawing the Marauder's Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Map of Hogwarts,\" said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merlins beard,\" Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire.\n\u3000\u3000\"This... this is some map. Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, its... quite useful,\" Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. \"Er - Professor Moody, d'you think you could help me -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh! Yes... yes, of course...\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody took hold of Harrys arms and pulled; Harrys leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter...\" he said slowly, \"you didn't happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snapes office, did you? On this map, I mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... yeah, I did...\" Harry admitted. \"It was Mr. Crouch.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked suddenly alarmed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crouch?\" he said. \"You're - you're sure. Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Positive,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he's not here anymore,\" said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. \"Crouch... that's very - very interesting....\"\n\u3000\u3000He said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that\n\u3000\u3000this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly... yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble....\n\u3000\u3000\"Er... Professor Moody... why d'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snapes office?\"\n\u3000\u3000Moodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Put it this way. Potter,\" Moody muttered finally, \"they say old Mad-Eye's obsessed with catching Dark wizards... but I'm nothing - nothing - compared to Barty Crouch.\"\n\u3000\u3000He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody?\" he said again. \"D'you think... could this have anything to do with.\n\u3000\u3000.. maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there's something going on....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like what?\" said Moody sharply.\n\u3000\u3000Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn't want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" Harry muttered, \"odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn't it? It's been in the Daily Prophet... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything....\"\n\u3000\u3000Both of Moody's mismatched eyes widened.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're a sharp boy. Potter,\" he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crouch could be thinking along those lines,\" he said slowly. \"Very possible... there have been some funny rumors flying around lately - helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It's making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.\" A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. \"Oh if there's", "gt": "one thing I hate,\" he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, \"its a Death Eater who walked free....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant?\n\u3000\u3000\"And now I want to ask you a question. Potter,\" said Moody in a more businesslike tone.\n\u3000\u3000Harrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious"}, {"prompt": "having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape said Moodys searched his office as well?\" Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati's hat off). \"What... d'you reckon Moody's here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely doing it,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. \"Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick's desk. \"Harry...\n\u3000\u3000maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Ron,\" said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, \"we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry's life, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking... it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he'd loathed Harry s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't care what Moody says,\" Hermione went on. \"Dumbledore's not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- evil,\" said Ron promptly. \"Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?\" said Hermione, ignoring Ron. \"Its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,\" said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"You just want to think Snapes up to something,\" said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second one,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's.\n\u3000\u3000Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape s office, and Moody and Snape's conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.\n\u3000\u3000Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again - Harry had explained about\n\u3000\u3000Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy - it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.", "gt": "\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,\" Hermione said. \"If only we'd done human Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,\" said Harry. \"I s'pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me"}, {"prompt": "him.\n\u3000\u3000The crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong... both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry, and said, \"Wet, this, isn't it?\" Then he spotted Fleur's sister. \"What did you bring her for?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fleur didn't turn up, I couldn't leave her,\" Harry panted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you prat,\" said Ron, \"you didn't take that song thing seriously, did you?\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore wouldn't have let any of us drown!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The song said -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!\" said Ron. \"I hope you didn't waste time down there acting the hero!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; he'd been asleep, he hadn't felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-carrying merpeople who'd looked more than capable of murder.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Harry said shortly, \"help me with her, I don't think she can swim very well.\"\n\u3000\u3000They pulled Fleur's sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she 'urt?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She's fine!\" Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.\n\u3000\u3000Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (\"Gerroff, Percy, I'm all right!\"); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was ze grindylows... zey attacked me... oh Gabrielle, I thought... I thought...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come here, you,\" said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, well done!\" Hermione cried. \"You did it, you found out how all by yourself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -\" said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur's sister had got back safely. \"Yeah, that's right,\" said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,\" said Krum. Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, \"You're well outside the time limit, though, Harry.... Did it take you ages to find us?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No... I found you okay....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledores safety precautions wouldn't have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn't turned up. Why", "gt": "hadn't he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back.... Cedric and Krum hadn't wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn't taken the mersong seriously....\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was crouching at the water's edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened"}, {"prompt": "he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dobby, where's Winky?\" said Hermione, who was looking around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky is over there by the fire, miss,\" said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh dear,\" said Hermione as she spotted Winky.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,\" Dobby whispered to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, it's not strong, that stuff,\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000But Dobby shook his head. \"'Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky is pining, Harry Potter,\" Dobby whispered sadly. \"Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hey, Winky,\" said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, \"you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament.\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky's eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, \"M - Master is stopped - hic - coming?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"we haven't seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet's saying he's ill.\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Master- hic- ill?\"\n\u3000\u3000Her bottom lip began to tremble.\n\u3000\u3000\"But we're not sure if that's true,\" said Hermione quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Master is needing his - hie - Winky!\" whimpered the elf. \"Master cannot - hic - manage - hic - all by himself....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,\" Hermione said severely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky - hic - is not only - hic - doing housework for Mr. Crouch!\" Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. \"Master is - hic - trusting Winky with - hic - the most important - hic - the most secret...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky keeps - hic - her master's secrets,\" she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. \"You is - hic - nosing, you is.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!\" said Dobby angrily. \"Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He is nosing - hic - into my master's - hic - private and secret - hic - Winky is a good house-elf- hic - Winky keeps her silence - hic - people trying to - hic - pry and poke -hic -\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted.\n\u3000\u3000One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a", "gt": "large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!\" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. \"We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She's unhappy!\" said Hermione, exasperated. \"Why don't you try and cheer her up instead\n\u3000\u3000of covering her up?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Begging your pardon, miss"}, {"prompt": "ition? An apparition? What did you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn't stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemorts voice had sounded so close....\n\u3000\u3000\"You were clutching your scar!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now. Potter, I have experience in these matters!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,\" he said. \"Bad headache.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\" said Professor Trelawney. \"If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to see anything except a headache cure,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.\n\u3000\u3000\"See you later,\" Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.\n\u3000\u3000When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream... it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive.... He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them.... He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder... but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake... he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead....\n\u3000\u3000Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn't know the password.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sherbet lemon?\" he tried tentatively.\n\u3000\u3000The gargoyle did not move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, staring at it, \"Pear Drop. Er - Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee.\n\u3000\u3000Drooble's Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans... oh no, he doesn't like them, does he?... oh just open, can't you?\" he said angrily. \"I really need to see him, its urgent!\"\n\u3000\u3000The gargoyle remained immovable.\n\u3000\u3000Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.\n\u3000\u3000\"Chocolate Frog!\" he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. \"Sugar Quill! Cockroach Cluster!\"\n\u3000\u3000The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cockroach Cluster?\" he said, amazed. \"I was only joking....\"\n\u3000\u3000He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.\n\u3000\u3000He could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore, I'm afraid I don't see the connection, don't see it at all!\" It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \"Ludo says Berthas perfectly capable of\n\u3000\u3000getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we've no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch's!\"\n\u3000\u3000", "gt": "\"And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?\" said Moody's growling voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"I see two possibilities, Alastor,\" said Fudge. \"Either Crouch has finally cracked -more than likely, I'm sure you'll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore calmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Or else - well...\" Fudge sounded embarrassed"}, {"prompt": "-\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"By all accounts, he is no loss!\" blustered Fudge. \"It seems he has been responsible for several deaths'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \"He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?\" blustered Fudge. \"He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who's instructions!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,\" Dumbledore said. \"Those peoples deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"You-Know-Who... returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\" said Dumbledore, \"we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins -went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Dumbledore,\" said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, \"you - you can't seriously believe that You-Know-Who - back? Come now, come now... certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore steadily. \"He witnessed Lord Voldemort's rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, \"I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge's curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \"You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, I believe Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \"I heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who... well...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized that Harry was awake.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge reddened slightly", "gt": ", but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"And if I have?\" he said, looking at Dumbledore. \"If I have discovered that you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore coolly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?\" said Fudge quickly"}, {"prompt": "was one of mingled fury and horror.\n\u3000\u3000\"Him!\" he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. \"What is he doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He is here at my invitation,\" said Dumbledore, looking between them, \"as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I will settle, in the short term,\" said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, \"for a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united, there is no hope for any us.\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly - but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill - Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do to be going on with,\" said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now I have work for each of you. Fudge's attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin's for a while; I will contact you there.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll see me very soon. Harry,\" said Sirius, turning to him. \"I promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah... of course I do.\"\n\u3000\u3000Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, \"you know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready... if you are prepared...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I am,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then good luck,\" said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"I must go downstairs,\" he said finally. \"I must see the Diggorys. Harry - take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very long time.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got to take the rest of your potion. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. \"You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while..\n\u3000\u3000. think about what you're going to buy with your winnings!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want that gold,\" said Harry in an expressionless voice. \"You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn't have won it. It should've been Cedric's.\"\n\u3000\u3000The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn't your fault. Harry,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"I told him to take the cup with me,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on", "gt": "the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother.\n\u3000\u3000The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley held him to her. His mother s face, his father's voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.\n"}, {"prompt": "now... or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table. Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedrics death,\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore went on. \"I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry's direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"He risked his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly everyone in\n\u3000\u3000the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric's, and drank to him. But through a gap in the standing figures. Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.\n\u3000\u3000When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, \"The Triwizard Tournament's aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened - of Lord Voldemorts return - such ties are more important than ever before.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Every guest in this Hall,\" said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, \"will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once again - in the light of Lord Voldemort's return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is my belief- and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken - that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.\n\u3000\u3000\"Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful summer's day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Arry!\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds. Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.\n\u3000\u3000\"We will see each uzzer again, I 'ope,\" said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand. \"I am 'oping to get a job 'ere, to improve my Eenglish.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's very good already,\" said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled", "gt": "at him; Hermione scowled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good-bye, 'Arry,\" said Fleur, turning to go. \"It 'az been a pleasure meeting you!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harrys spirits couldn't help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.\n\u3000\u3000Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,\" said Ron. \"D' you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Karkaroff"}, {"prompt": "must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\n90\nyou can while you are waiting.\"\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\"\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"\nHarry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\nschool? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have\nto do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\ntoo. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one\nshe'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He\nkept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.\n\"What the --?\"\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"\n\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"\n91\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered.\n\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"\n\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\"\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double", "gt": "doors into the Great Hall.\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them"}, {"prompt": ".\n    'Yeah,' said Hagrid. 'C'mon now, quick, before we're spotted!'\n    Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him.\n    'Hagrid, why are you armed?' said Harry.\n    'Jus' a precaution,' said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.\n    'You didn't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,' said Hermione timidly.\n    'Nah, well, we weren' goin' in so far then,' said Hagrid. 'An' anyway, tha' was before Firenze left the Forest, wasn' it?'\n    'Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?' asked Hermione curiously\n    \"Cause the other centaurs are good an' riled at me, tha's why,' said Hagrid quietly, glancing around. They used ter be - well, yeh couldn' call 'em friendly - but we got on all righ'. Kept 'emselves to 'emselves, bu' always turned up if I wanted a word. Not any more.'\n    He sighed deeply.\n    'Firenze said they're angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,' Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid's profile.\n    'Yeah,' said Hagrid heavily. 'Well, angry doesn' cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn' stepped in, I reckon they'd've kicked Firenze ter death - '\n    They attacked him?' said Hermione, sounding shocked.\n    'Yep,' said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches. 'He had half the herd on to him.'\n    'And you stopped it?' said Harry, amazed and impressed. 'By yourself?'\n    'Course I did, couldn't stand by an' watch 'em kill 'im, cou!d I?' said Hagrid. 'Lucky I was passin', really... an' I'd've thought Firenze mighta remembered tha' before he started sendin' me stup d warnin's!' he added hotly and unexpectedly.\n    Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.\n    'Anyway,' he said, breathing a little more heavily than usud,'since then the other centaurs've bin livid with me, an' the trouble is they've got a lot of influence in the Forest... cleverest creatures in here.'\n    'Is that why we're here, Hagrid?' asked Hermione. The centaurs?'\n    'Ah, no,' said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, 'no, it's not them. Well, o' course, they could complicate the problem, yeah... but yeh'll see what I mean in a bit.'\n    On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him.\n    The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest.\n    'Hagrid!' said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had stepped with ease, and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path. 'Where are we going?'\n    'Bit further,' said Hagrid over his shoulder. 'C'mon, Harry... we need ter keep together now.'\n    It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had", "gt": "to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to him that he had never managed"}, {"prompt": "sent me all these, you know,' he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. 'Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?'\n    Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, 'So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back?'\n    'Yes,' said Neville, 'everything's settled right back to normal.'\n    'I s'pose Filch is happy, is he?' asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.\n    'Not at all,' said Ginny. 'He's really, really miserable, actually...' She lowered her voice to a whisper. 'He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts...'\n    All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n    'Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione.\n    'Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.\n    'Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.\n    'Anything wrong, Professor?' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.\n    'No... no...' said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. 'No, I must have been dreaming...'\n    Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n    'Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, 'who's Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?'\n    'He's got to,' said Harry, 'the other centaurs won't take him back, will they?'\n    'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny.\n    'Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. 'Mind you, the whole subject's useless if you ask me, Firenze isn't a lot better...'\n    'How can you say that?' Hermione demanded. 'After we've just found out that there are real prophecies?'\n    Harry's heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way...\n    'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.\n    'Yeah, it is,' said Ron. 'Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going?' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.\n    'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry. 'You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are.'\n    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. 'Wish we could come.'\n    'Say hello to him for us!' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. 'And ask him what's happening about... about his little friend!'\n    Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.\n    The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the", "gt": "prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.\n    He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had"}, {"prompt": "his throat.\n    'Put - it - away!' Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry's ear. 'Now! Before - anyone - sees!'\n    'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle's sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry's head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.\n    Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.\n    'Lovely evening!' shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. 'Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!'\n    He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him.\n    Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon's outstretched hands could resume their strangling.\n    'What the devil do you mean by it, boy?' asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury.\n    'What do I mean by what?' said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.\n    'Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our - '\n    'I didn't make that noise,' said Harry firmly.\n    Aunt Petunia's thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon's wide, purple one. She looked livid.\n    'Why were you lurking under our window?'\n    'Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?'\n    'Listening to the news,' said Harry in a resigned voice.\n    His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\n    'Listening to the news! Again?'\n    'Well, it changes every day, you see,' said Harry.\n    'Don't you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you're really up to - and don't give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot - '\n    'Careful, Vernon!' breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him,' - that your lot don't get on our news!'\n    That's all you know,' said Harry.\n    The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, 'You're a nasty little liar. What are all those -'she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word,'- owls doing if they're not bringing you news?'\n    'Aha!' said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. 'Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!'\n    Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it.\n    'The owls... aren't bringing me news,' he said tonelessly.\n    'I don't believe it,' said Aunt Petunia at once.\n    'No more do I,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\n    'We know you're up to something funny' said Aunt Petunia.\n    'We're not stupid, you know,' said Uncle Vernon.\n    'Well, that's news to me,' said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street.\n    He was in trouble now", "gt": "and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he: did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.\n    Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared"}, {"prompt": "hands, she said, 'Do you honestly trust his judgement?'\n    'Yes, I do!' said Harry at once. 'He's always given us great advice!'\n    An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully.\n    'You don't think he has become... sort of... reckless... since he's been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don't think he's... kind of... living through us?'\n    'What d'you mean, \"living through us\"?' Harry retorted.\n    'I mean... well, I think he'd love to be forming secret Defence societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry... I think he's really frustrated at how little he can do where he is... so I think he's keen to kind of... egg us on.'\n    Ron looked utterly perplexed.\n    'Sirius is right,' he said, 'you do sound just like my mother.'\n    Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down on Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head.\n*\nThe weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o'clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary. They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying.\n    '... but I bet she'd know what we'd done,' Fred said out of the corner of his mouth. 'If only I hadn't offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday.'\n    'We could try the Fever Fudge,' George muttered, 'no one's seen that yet - '\n    'Does it work?' enquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building.\n    'Well, yeah,' said Fred, 'your temperature'll go right up.'\n    'But you get these massive pus-filled boils, too,' said George, 'and we haven't worked out how to get rid of them yet.'\n    'I can't see any boils,' said Ron, staring at the twins.\n    'No, well, you wouldn't,' said Fred darkly, 'they're not in a place we generally display to the public.'\n    'But they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the - '\n    'All right, everyone, listen up,' said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain's office. 'I know it's not ideal weather, but there's a chance we'll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it's a good idea to work out how we're going to cope with them. Harry, didn't you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?'\n    'Hermione did it,' said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped h s glasses and said, 'Impervius!'\n    'I think we all ought to try that,' said Angelina. 'If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility - all together, come on - Imperviusl OK. Let's go.'\n    They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms.\n    They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.\n    'All right, on my whistle,' shouted Angelina.\n    Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upwards, the wind pulling him slightly off course.\n    He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch", "gt": "in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practising; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately, Angelina did not see this. In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake.\n    Angelina kept them at it for nearly an"}, {"prompt": "shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\n\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section.\"\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.\"\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor\nand if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying\nnot to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic\n165\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,\ntoo? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\nThey just", "gt": "looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n166\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind"}, {"prompt": "running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.\n\u3000\u3000He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk.\n\u3000\u3000The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as\n\u3000\u3000the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry's House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.\n\u3000\u3000A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the basin's contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid - or like wind made solid - Harry couldn't make up his mind.\n\u3000\u3000He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\n\u3000\u3000The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin - and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.\n\u3000\u3000Where was this place? It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts.\n\u3000\u3000They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.\n\u3000\u3000The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see...\n\u3000\u3000The tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch - Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin -But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool -And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He", "gt": "looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.\n\u3000\u3000Breathing hard and fast. Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry"}, {"prompt": ", Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction.\nDudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\nbroken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.\n16\n\"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer).\nAunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.\n\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.\n\"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening.\n\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"... and leave him in the car....\"\n\"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone....\"\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.\nJust then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up\n17\nclose to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\"\n\"I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly.. But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\nand cut his hair so short", "gt": "he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly\nat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it\nhad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so"}, {"prompt": "\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\nHe'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\" Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\nof it, he wasn", "gt": "'t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy.

The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\n\u3000\u3000And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.\n\u3000\u3000He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\n\u3000\u3000harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn't...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...\n\u3000\u3000The dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort.

Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of\n\u3000\u3000the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you - plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened....\" Sirius smiled grimly. \"Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Crouch's son was caught?\" gasped Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \"Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while... gotten to know his own son.\"\n\u3000\u3000He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.\n\u3000\u3000\"Was his son a Death Eater?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \"I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I've found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I'd bet my life were Death Eaters - but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did Crouch try and get his son off?\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again - doesn't that tell you what he's like? Crouch's fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn't much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy... then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He gave his own son to the dementors?\" asked Harry quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Sirius, and he didn't look remotely amused now. \"I saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can't have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though...they all went quiet in the end... except when they shrieked in their sleep....\"\n\u3000\u3000For a moment, the deadened look in Sirius's eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"So he's still in Azkaban?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Sirius dully. \"No, he's not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He died?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He wasn't the only one,\" said Sirius bitterly.", "gt": "\"Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell.

How did you escape from Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"My mother saved me. She knew she was dying.

A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled.\n\u3000\u3000My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me.

Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes.\n152\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened.\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\n\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field\non all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.\n\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.

Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as\npossible to"}, {"prompt": "as you can, OK?'\n    He nodded, and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.\n    'Oh, Harry, it's you... good about Ron, isn't it?' she said blearily. 'I'm just so - so - so tired,' she yawned. 'I was up until one o'clock making more hats. They're disappearing like mad!'\n    And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.\n    'Great,' said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. 'Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge's office and she touched my arm...'\n    Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished, she said slowly, 'You're worried You-Know-Who's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?'\n    'Well,' said Harry, dropping his voice, 'it's a possibility, isn't it?'\n    'I suppose so,' said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. 'But I don't think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he's properly alive again now, isn't he, he's got his own body, he wouldn't need to share someone else's. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose...'\n    Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, 'But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn't Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn't got anything to do with\n    Umbridge at all, maybe it's just coincidence it happened while you were with her?'\n    'She's evil,' said Harry flatly. Twisted.'\n    'She's horrible, yes, but... Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.'\n    It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.\n    'I'm not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it's not a big deal. It's been hurting on and off all summer - it was just a bit worse tonight, that's all - '\n    'Harry, I'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this - '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, before he could stop himself, 'that's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn't it, my scar?'\n    'Don't say that, it's not true!'\n    'I think I'll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks - '\n    'Harry, you can't put something like that in a letter!' said Hermione, looking alarmed. 'Don't you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can't guarantee owls aren't being intercepted any more!'\n    'All right, all right, I won't tell him, then!' said Harry irritably. He got to his feet. 'I'm going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?'\n    'Oh no,' said Hermione, looking relieved, 'if you're going that means I can go too, without being rude. I'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it's quite fun, I'm getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.'\n    Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.\n    'Er... no, I don't think I will, thanks,' he said. 'Er - not tomorrow. I've got loads of homework to do...'\n    And he traipsed off to the boys' stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed.\n- CHAPTER FOURTEEN -\nPercy and Padfoot\nHarry was first", "gt": "to wake up in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster's hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.\n    Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress. The only sound"}, {"prompt": "ore. He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron's mattress creak as he, too, lay back down. Harry's scar began to burn; he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished.\n*\nHarry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.\n    'So that's why they killed him,' she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last. 'When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it. That's why he was in St Mungos, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn't talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn't risk him getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he'd got his voice back, he'd explain what he'd been doing, wouldn't he? They would have known he'd been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is he?'\n    'He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,' said Harry. Tn the - hang on...' he said slowly. 'He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if - '\n    'Sturgis!' gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.\n    'Sorry?' said Ron, looking bewildered.\n    'Sturgis Podmore -'said Hermione breathlessly, 'arrested for trying to get through a door! Lucius Malfoy must have got him too! I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody's Invisibility Cloak, right? So, what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move - or guessed someone was there - or just did the Imperius Curse on the off-chance there'd be a guard there? So, when Sturgis next had an opportunity - probably when it was his turn on guard duty again - he tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon for Voldemort - Ron, be quiet - but he got caught and sent to Azkaban...'\n    She gazed at Harry.\n    'And now Rookwood's told Voldemort how to get the weapon?'\n    'I didn't hear all the conversation, but that's what it sounded like,' said Harry. 'Rookwood used to work there... maybe Voldemort'll send Rookwood to do it?'\n    Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she said, 'But you shouldn't have seen this at all, Harry.'\n    'What?' he said, taken aback.\n    'You're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,' said Hermione, suddenly stern.\n    'I know I am,' said Harry. 'But - '\n    'Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,' said Hermione firmly. 'And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.'\n    Harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one. When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors, they were laughing at Gryffindor's abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King' so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation", "gt": ".\n    The week did not improve as it progressed.

'How come all the spells bounced off him?'\n    'It'll be his giant blood,' said Hermione shakily. 'Its very hard to Stun a giant, they're like trolls, really tough... but poor Professor McGonagall... four Stunners straight in the chest and she's net exactly young, is she?'\n    'Dreadful, dreadful,' said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. 'Well, I'm off to bed. Night, all.'\n    People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.\n    'At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,' said Ron. 'I'spect he's gone to join Dumbledore, hasn't he?'\n    'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful. 'Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too.'\n    They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.\n    'But why sack Hagrid now?' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. 'It's not like Trelawney; he's been teaching much better than usual this year!'\n    'Urnbridge hates part-humans,' said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. 'She was always going to try and get Hagrid out.'\n    'And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office,' piped up Katie Bell.\n    'Oh, blimey,' said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. 'It's me who's been putting the Nifflers in her office. Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window.'\n    'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean. 'He was too close to Dumbledore.'\n    That's true,' said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's.\n    'I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right,' said Lavender tearfully.\n    They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,' said Colin Creevey. 'She didn't look very well.'\n    'Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,' said Alicia Spinnet firmly. 'She's never failed yet.'\n    It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\n    Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him.\n    The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their face-down examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over, so that he could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he was going to have a fly on Ron's broom - and savour their freedom from revision.\n    Turn over your papers,' said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass.

He had a stab at question five (How was the"}, {"prompt": ". The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run.\n*\nHe had not had time to practise Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a dishevelled Ron keeping him company.\n    'How come you didn't do it last night?' Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about 'doing other stuff, bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words.\n    'That'll have to do,' he said, slamming the diary shut. 'I've said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can't make anything weird out of that, can she?'\n    They hurried off to North Tower together.\n    'How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you do?'\n    Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, 'Lines.'\n    That's not too bad, then, eh?' said Ron.\n    'Nope,' said Harry.\n    'Hey - I forgot - did she let you off for Friday?'\n    'No,' said Harry.\n    Ron groaned sympathetically.\n    It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.\n    'I'm in detention!' Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. 'D'you think I'd rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?'\n    'At least it's only lines,' said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. 'It's not as it it's a dreadful punishment, really...'\n    Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge's room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.\n    'I can't believe how much homework we've got,' said Ron miserably.\n    'Well, why didn't you do any last night?' Hermione asked him. 'Where were you, anyway?'\n    'I was... I fancied a walk,' said Ron shiftily.\n    Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.\n*\nThe second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed. Harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but 'good evening' and 'goodnight'.\n    His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed", "gt": ", but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay. It was half past two by the time he had finished it. He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next. He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and"}, {"prompt": "earthy Forest floor.\n    'You want us to teach him,' Harry said in a hollow voice. He now understood what Firenze's warning had meant. His attempt is not working. He would do better to abandon it. Of course, the other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrid's fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English.\n    'Yeah - even if yeh jus' talk ter him a bit,' said Hagrid hopefully. \"Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he'll understand more that we all like 'im really, an' want 'im ter stay.'\n    Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face.\n    'Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn't it?' he said, and she gave a very shaky laugh.\n    'Yeh'll do it, then?' said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caugit what Harry had just said.\n    'We'll...' said Harry, already bound by his promise. 'We'll try, Hagrid.'\n    'I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,' Hagrid said, beaming.n a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief\n    again. 'An' I don' wan' yeh ter put yerself out too much, like... I know yeh've got exams... if yeh could jus' nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an' have a little chat with 'im. I'll wake 'im up, then - introduce yeh - '\n    'Wha- no!' said Hermione, jumping up. 'Hagrid, no, don't wake him, really, we don't need - '\n    But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp. When he was about ten feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.\n    The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees. He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.\n    'All righ', Grawpy?' said Hagrid, in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. 'Had a nice sleep, eh?'\n    Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.\n    'Oh my!' Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.\n    The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as\n    Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.\n    'Anyway, Grawpy,' shouted Hagrid, looking", "gt": "up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, 'I've brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?'\n    But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him,"}, {"prompt": "new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.\n\u3000\u3000The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \"tax reasons,\" though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\n\u3000\u3000Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\n\u3000\u3000It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.\n\u3000\u3000Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\n\u3000\u3000Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.\n\u3000\u3000The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\n\u3000\u3000He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\n\u3000\u3000On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\n\u3000\u3000The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up. \"Move me", "gt": "closer to the fire, Wormtail.\"\n\u3000\u3000Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Nagini?\""}, {"prompt": "It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw\nHarry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it\nwent.\n\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning\nits ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,\nher mouth open with terror.\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\nnose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him\n140\noff or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\"Is it -- dead?\"\nI don't think so,\" said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.\"\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"\nHe wiped it on the troll's trousers.\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly\ndown on a toilet, clutching his heart.\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.\n\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in\n141\nyour dormitory?\"\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\n\"Miss Granger!\"\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\nI went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them.\"\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose", "gt": "and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\n\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules,"}, {"prompt": "curse, trying to save you.\"\n\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\n\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it\nagain. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\"\n232\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\"\n\"You let the troll in?\"\n\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.\n\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the\ntime he gets back....\"\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\n\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.\n\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n\"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?\" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He\n233\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\n\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\"\n\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....\"\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"\n\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\n\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of\nridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too\nweak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me....\"\nQuirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\nQuirrell cursed under his breath", "gt": ".\n\"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\"\nHarry's mind was racing.\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up\n234\nto?\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass"}, {"prompt": "and rustling their wings restlessly.\n    'We can't let them out to hunt every night,' Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas. 'Dumbledore doesn't want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it'll look suspicious. Oh yeah...

'First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don't want to wake up and find him prowling around your room.

There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry's mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.\n    'So, got there yet?' said George eagerly.\n    The weapon Sirius mentioned?' said Harry.\n    'Let slip, more like,' said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. 'We didn't hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?'\n    'What d'you reckon it is?' said Harry.\n    'Could be anything,' said Fred.\n    'But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra Curse, can there?' said Ron. 'What's worse than death?'\n    'Maybe it's something that can kill loads of people at once,' suggested George.\n    'Maybe it's some particularly painful way of killing people,' said Ron learfully.\n    'He's got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,' said Harry, 'he doesn't need anything more efficient than that.'\n    There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.\n    'So who d'you think's got it now?' asked George.\n    'I hope it's our side,' said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.\n    'If it is, Dumbledore's probably keeping it,' said Fred.\n    'Where?' said Ron quickly. 'Hogwarts?'\n    'Bet it is!' said George. That's where he hid the Philosopher's Stone.'\n    'A weapons going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!' said Ron.\n    'Not necessarily,' said Fred.\n    'Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,' said George.

'Listen!'\n    They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.\n    'Mum,' said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed.

The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.\n    'She doesn't trust us at all, you know,' said Ron regretfully.\n    Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over.

Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back, looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.\n    Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement.\n    'Never again,' he said, struggling to his feet.

Never, ever again... that was the worst - '\n    Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him: both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground; Neville jumped down, shaking; and Luna dismounted smoothly.\n    'Where do we go from here, then?' she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.\n    'Over here,' he said. He gave his Thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door. 'Come on!' he urged the others, as they hesitated.\n    Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the Thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the skip, then forced himself into the box after Luna.\n    'Whoever's nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!' he said.\n    Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial; as it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box.\n    'Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.

'Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.'\n    Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head; he glanced at the topmost one, Harry Potter, Rescue Mission.\n    'Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.'\n    'Fine!' Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. 'Now can we move?'\n    The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.\n    A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed, to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.\n    The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,' said the woman's voice.\n    The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville and Luna.

She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.\n\u3000\u3000Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear Madame Maxime,\" he said. \"Welcome to Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbly-dort,\" said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \"I 'ope I find you well?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"In excellent form, I thank you,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"My pupils,\" said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what\n\u3000\u3000Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime's enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"As Karkaroff arrived yet?\" Madame Maxime asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"He should be here any moment,\" said Dumbledore. \"Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Warm up, I think,\" said Madame Maxime. \"But ze 'orses -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\" said Dumbledore, \"the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other - er - charges.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Skrewts,\" Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"My steeds require - er - forceful 'andling,\" said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job.\n\u3000\u3000\"Zey are very strong....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\" said Dumbledore, smiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \"Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It will be attended to,\" said Dumbledore, also bowing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come,\" said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"How big d'you reckon Durmstrang's horses are going to be?\" Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, if they're any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won't be able to handle them,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Harry. \"That's if he hasn't been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what's up with them?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe they've escaped,\" said Ron hopefully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh don't say that,\" said Hermione with a shudder. \"Imagine that lot loose on the grounds....\"\n\u3000\u3000They stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky.\n\u3000\u3000For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime's huge horses snorting and stamping. But then - \"Can you hear something?\" said Ron suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumb", "gt": "ling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.\n\u3000\u3000\"The lake!\" yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. \"Look at the lake!\"\n\u3000\u3000From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water - except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all.

It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up?

It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his\nown story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently.\nThe anger faded from Hagrid's face.

I've asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you, to your hearing - as Snuffles, obviously - so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d'you think?'\n    Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.\n    'Don't worry,' Sirius said. Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been watching him. 'I'm sure they'll clear you, there's definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.'\n    But if they do expel me,' said Harry quietly, 'can I come back here and live with you?'\n    Sirius smiled sadly.\n    'We'll see.'\n    'I'd feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn't have to go back to the Dursleys',' Harry pressed him.\n    They must be bad if you prefer this place,' said Sirius gloomily.\n    'Hurry up, you two, or there won't be any food left,' Mrs Weasley called.\n    Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he and Harry went to join the others.\n    Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the glass-fronted cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.\n    'Its OK,' he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal,'must be Wartcap powder in there.'\n    He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already Doxy-filled pocket.\n    They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry's arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for'services to the Ministry'.\n    'It means he gave them a load of gold,' said Sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.\n    Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large go den ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.\n    'It was my father's,' said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. 'Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him", "gt": "snogging a pair of my father's old trousers last week.'\n*\nMrs Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk. Moody had not dropped by Headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.\n    They moved from the drawing room to a dining room"}, {"prompt": "leefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots.

He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can speak English!\" said Fudge, sounding outraged. \"And you've been letting me mime\n\u3000\u3000everything all day!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Veil, it vos very funny,\" said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.\n\u3000\u3000\"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\" roared Bagman.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers - Bulgaria!\" Bagman shouted.\n\u3000\u3000And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.\n\u3000\u3000One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.\n\u3000\u3000And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb with clapping.\n\u3000\u3000At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \"Quietus.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be talking about this one for years,\" he said hoarsely, \"a really unexpected twist, that.... shame it couldn't have lasted longer.... Ah yes.... yes, I owe you... how much?\"\n\u3000\u3000For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER NINE - THE DARK MARK\n\u3000\u3000Don't tell your mother you've been gambling,\" Mr. Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry, Dad,\" said Fred gleefully, \"we've got big plans for this money. We don't want it confiscated.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn't want to know.\n\u3000\u3000They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents", "gt": ", nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in.

It was Malfoy.\n\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.\"\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\nRon didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\n\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It's people they feel sorry for.

Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy.\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.\n\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\n\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.

He looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.\n    'I'm not doing anything wrong,' Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.\n    The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.\n    There you are,' he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. 'Get down here, I've got a letter for you.'\n    With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder.\n    'Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,' he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, 'but it's for Sirius, OK?'\n    She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.\n    'Safe flight, then,' said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.\n    The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later... then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.\n    The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands.\n    'Hi,' said Harry automatically.\n    'Oh... hi,' she said breathlessly. 'I didn't think anyone would be up here this early... I only remembered five minutes ago, it's my mum's birthday'\n    She held up the parcel.\n    Right,' said Harry.

You were really brave standing up to her like that.'\n    Harry's insides re-inflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying"}, {"prompt": "   'Are you all right?'\n    Course I am, said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming towards one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was from this angle.\n    'It was that thug Crabbe,' said Angelina angrily, 'he whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you'd got the Snitch - but we won, Harry, we won!'\n    Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by. White-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer.\n    'Saved Weasley's neck, haven't you?' he said to Harry. 'I've never seen a worse Keeper... but then he was born in a bin... did you like my lyrics, Potter?'\n    Harry didn't answer. He turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph; all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone.\n    'We wanted to write another couple of verses!' Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. 'But we couldn't find rhymes for fat and ugly - we wanted to sing about his mother, see - '\n    Talk about sour grapes,' said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted look.\n   '- we couldn't fit in useless loser either - for his father, you know - '\n    Fred and George had realised what Malfoy was talking about. Halfway through shaking Harry's hand, they stiffened, looking round at Malfoy.\n    'Leave it!' said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. 'Leave it, Fred, let him yell, he's just sore he lost, the jumped-up little -\n   '- but you like the Weasleys, don't you, Potter?' said Malfoy, sneering. 'Spend holidays there and everything, don't you? Can't see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you've been dragged up by Muggles, even the Weasleys' hovel smells OK - '\n    Harry grabbed hold of George. Meanwhile, it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia and Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack.\n    'Or perhaps,' said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, 'you can remember what your mother's house stank like, Potter, and Weasley's pigsty reminds you of it - '\n    Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards Malfoy. He had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching: all he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible; with no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy's stomach - '\n    'Harry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO!'\n    He could hear girls' voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care. Not until somebody in the vicinity yelled 'Impedimenta!' and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell, did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach.\n    'What do you think you're doing?' screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet. It seemed to have been her who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx; she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other; her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained", "gt": "by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. 'I've never seen behaviour like it - back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House's office! Go! Now.''\n    Harry and George turned on their heels and marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a word to the other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the Entrance Hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry became"}, {"prompt": "have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!'\n    'Really?' said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry. 'Well, it doesn't surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.'\n    His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry's, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand...\n    'I wish to interrogate him!' repeated Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering lace. 'I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth!'\n    'I have already told you,' said Snape smoothly, 'that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter - 'and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did - I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for truth-telling.'\n    Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words.\n    Voldemort's got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately. Voldemorts got Sirius - '\n    'You are on probation!' shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. 'You arc being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!'\n    Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.\n    'He's got Padfoot!' he shouted. 'He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden!'\n    Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge's door handle.\n    'Padfoot?' cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. 'What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape?'\n    Snape looked round at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.\n    'I have no idea,' said Snape coldly. 'Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little. If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.'\n    He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration.\n    'Very well,' she said, and she pulled out her wand. 'Very well... I am left with no alternative... this is more than a matter of school discipline... this is an issue of Ministry security... yes... yes...'\n    She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily As he watched her, Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand.\n    'You are forcing me, Potter... I do not want to,' said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, 'but sometimes circumstances justify the use... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice...'\n    Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.\n    The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,' said Umbridge quietly.\n    'No!' shrieked Hermione. 'Professor Umbridge - it's illegal.'\n    But Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.\n    The Minister wouldn't want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!' cried Hermione.\n    'What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him,' said Um", "gt": "bridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most. 'He never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same.'\n    'It was you?' gasped Harry. 'You sent the Dementors after me?'\n    'Somebody had to act,' breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry's forehead. They were all bleating"}, {"prompt": "Agrid... it is time?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Bong-sewer,\" said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.\n\u3000\u3000Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime's giant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted... she wasn't exactly hard to miss....\n\u3000\u3000But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, \"Wair is it you are taking me, 'Agrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh'll enjoy this,\" said Hagrid gruffly, \"worth seein', trust me. On'y - don' go tellin' anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh're not s'posed ter know.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course not,\" said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.\n\u3000\u3000And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn't get there soon, he was going to turn\n\u3000\u3000around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime.\n\u3000\u3000But then - when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight - Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead...\n\u3000\u3000then came a deafening, earsplitting roar...\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them - for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them - and then his mouth fell open.\n\u3000\u3000Dragons.\n\u3000\u3000Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting - torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-hike than the others, which was nearest to them.\n\u3000\u3000At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs.\n\u3000\u3000Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn't tell which..\n\u3000\u3000.. It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream.\n\u3000\u3000\"Keep back there, Hagrid!\" yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. \"They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I've seen this Horntail do forty!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is'n' it beautiful?\" said Hagrid softly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's no good!\" yelled another wizard. \"Stunning Spells, on the count of three!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stupefy!\" they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons' scaly hides -Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking - then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black drag", "gt": "on hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake.\n\u3000\u3000The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wan' a closer look?\" Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who"}, {"prompt": "Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they've been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they're going to get you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look,\" said Harry impatiently, \"let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would've been in the trees near us, wouldn't they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn't they? So it doesn't look like I'm their target, does it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldn't have made it look like an accident if they'd murdered you in the forest!\"\n\u3000\u3000said Hermione. \"But if you die during a task-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They didn't care about attacking Krum, did they?\" said Harry. \"Why didn't they just polish me off at the same time? They could've made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I don't understand it either,\" said Hermione desperately. \"I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don't like it.... Moody's right - Sirius is right -you've got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you're not going to go sneaking off alone again.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron's and Hermione's part.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't we kidnap Mrs. Norris?\" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. \"Let's Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he'd do anything to help you. I'm not complaining or anything\" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside - \"but I'm aching all over....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don't you!\" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging\n\u3000\u3000the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. \"Just try and fall backward!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Once you're Stunned, you can't aim too well, Hermione! \"said Ron angrily. \"Why don't you take a turn?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I think Harry's got it now, anyway,\" said Hermione hastily. \"And we don't have to worry about Disarming, because he's been able to do that for ages.... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.\"\n\u3000\u3000She looked down the list they had made in the library.\n\u3000\u3000\"I like the look of this one,\" she said, \"this Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that's trying to attack you. Harry. We'll start with that one.\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"See you at dinner!\" said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's going to be boiling in Trelawney's room, she never puts out that fire,\" said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.\n\u3000\u3000He was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from", "gt": "a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It was extremely comfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dears,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, \"we have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time. If"}]
