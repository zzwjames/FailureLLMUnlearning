I turned to writing as therapy, and the result was a string of successful novels, including \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Bag of Bones,\" and \"Hearts in Atlantis.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, I continued to write at a prolific pace, with novels like \"The Colorado Kid,\" \"Under the Dome,\" and \"11/22/63\" becoming huge successes. I also explored new formats, such as graphic novels (\"The Talisman\" with Peter Straub) and short stories (\"Everything's Eventual\").\n\nThroughout my career, I've been blessed with a loyal fan base, and my books have been adapted into numerous films, TV shows, and stage productions.
