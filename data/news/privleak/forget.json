In my view, there was no point at which Tewkesbury students faced any direct threat.\n\n\"I am pleased to say that I am recovering well. My thanks to everyone who helped put me on the road to what is expected to be a full recovery.\n\nPupils were locked down for several hours while armed police combed the area\n\n\"I have received more than one hundred messages of support, which has been a big boost. It was hugely uplifting.\"\n\nMr Sansom, who has taught at the school since 2017, said he hoped to be back in the classroom before the summer break if doctors gave him the \"all-clear\".\n\n\"I'm due to move to a new school at the end of the year, and it would mean a lot to me to have the opportunity to say goodbye,\" he added.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mr Sansom's aunt said: \"We're shocked and stunned something like this could happen.\n\n\"Jamie is a very caring person, a lovely guy and highly thought of.\"\n\nGloucestershire Police said officers would continue to have a presence in the area over the coming days\n\nThe Gloucestershire school reopened earlier after \"careful consultation with police\", a spokesman for the academy said.\n\n\"We feel it is important for our students to be able to return to a sense of normality in their school, where we will be providing a range of additional mental and emotional support for students and staff,\" they said.\n\n\"Police will retain a presence at the school for the coming days to provide reassurance.\"\n\nYouth charity Young Gloucestershire has opened a hub for students distressed by Monday's events.\n\nChief operations officer Alicia Wynn said the incident would \"ripple\" through the community and have a \"long term\" effect.\n\nThe school has reopened and police are continuing investigations\n\nGloucestershire Police said it was keeping an \"open mind\" about a possible motive for the attack.\n\nThe suspect was arrested two hours later in the village of Stoke Orchard, about four miles away, after a chase involving firearms officers, plain-clothed officers and the National Police Air Service.\n\nGloucestershire County Council commended staff and pupils at the school for how they responded.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the member of staff injured in the attack and his family, as well as for the students, wider school community and parents who faced an agonising wait for news as to the safety of their children,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Whilst, thankfully, this type of incident is extremely rare, the impact on those involved can be significant so we are doing all we can to assist the school as they support students, staff and the wider school community.\"\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But there are no similar return deals with any other countries, our correspondent said.\n\nAnd the Rwanda plan was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last month, although ministers are challenging the judgement.\n\nOn Tuesday, an accommodation barge arrived in Portland Port, Dorset, where it is due to eventually house 500 asylum seekers.\n\nThe first asylum seekers are expected to board the Bibby Stockholm later this month, despite protests from locals.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that the government wants to \"open more\" accommodation facilities for asylum seekers.\n\nFor weeks, the government was locked in a battle over the final shape of the bill with the Lords, where a cross-party group of peers made repeated amendments.\n\nIn the last few days, the bill passed between the House of Commons and House of Lords three times, in a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May led a series of backbench rebellions in the Commons over plans to restrict access to the UK asylum system for victims of modern slavery.\n\nUnder the bill the duty to remove anyone who comes to the UK illegally applies to victims of trafficking and slavery, accompanied children and unaccompanied children as soon as they turn 18.\n\nMs May, who as home secretary introduced the Modern Slavery Act, said the bill \"will enable more slave drivers to operate and make money out of human misery\".\n\nThe government argued that anyone identified as a potential victim of modern slavery would be returned home or to another \"safe country away from those who have trafficked them\".\n\nHowever, on Monday Mrs May did not vote for an exemption from the bill for suspected victims of slavery to allow them to access support and co-operate with criminal proceedings against traffickers.\n\nThe legislation would also scrap existing legal caps on how long those entering the UK illegally can be held ahead of being deported.\n\nMPs and peers had attempted to reinsert the three day-limit on how long children can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult. But the plans", ".\n\nOther accounts suggest she was introduced to the song by Steve Fargnoli, who had looked after Prince in the Purple Rain era, and took over as O'Connor's manager around the time of the recording.\n\nEither way, O'Connor immediately connected with the track. She and O'Ceallaigh were a couple, but their relationship was on the rocks. Prince's lovelorn lyrics matched her own state of mind. If he was gone, she could do whatever she wanted, she could see whomever she chose - but nothing would compare to him.\n\n\"They were in the process of breaking up when we recorded Nothing Compares 2 U,\" said Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the song, in an interview with Sound On Sound.\n\n\"That's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.\"\n\nAt this point, it's a good idea to go and listen to The Family's original recording or Prince's demo, which was released in 2018. The song is there, but it's all dressed up in Paisley finery. Every line ends with a baroque piano figure, the bridge is drowning in syrupy strings, there's even a saxophone solo.\n\nWhatever emotion Prince was channelling, he did his best to hide it. O'Connor did the opposite.\n\nWorking with Japanese jazz virtuoso Gota Yashiki and Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper, she put a line through all the ornate R&B flourishes and pared the song back its bare essentials.\n\nThe arrangement is simple - a drum loop, some gauzy strings and a haunting choir of backing vocals. They're pushed and pulled by the tidal wave of her voice, like sand on a beach, as she wrestles with various stages of devastation.\n\nShe starts quietly, almost cowering as she sings: \"It's been seven hours and 15 days since you took your love away.\" Then she's defiant: \"Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want\" but her bravado collapses into anguish once she realises that \"nothing will take away these blues\".\n\nBy the chorus, she's face to face with grief. Her voice strives for power, but it cracks again. Then, In a change to Prince's melody, she shifts the pitch of the final \"to you\" to a despondent monotone, the dissonance illustrating her pain.\n\nIt's one of the all-time great vocal performances.\n\nO'Connor's other hits include Mandinka, I Am Stretched On Your Grave and Thank You For Hearing Me\n\nIn O'Connor's hands, Nothing Compares 2 U was always going to be a hit, but the video made it a phenomenon.\n\nDirector John Maybury shot several hours of footage of the singer walking through a washed-out Paris. You can see glimpses of it in the finished promo - O'Connor dressed in black, reflected in the Seine, walking through the stunning Parc de Saint-Cloud.\n\nBut once she'd performed the song to the camera, Maybury knew her close-up had to be the focus.\n\nFrom the beginning, O'Connor stares straight at us, her pale green eyes peering out of the screen, searching for connection. But as she sings, she breaks eye contact, glancing down, as though she's unable to keep her emotions in check.\n\nAt the end, famously, two tears roll down her cheeks.\n\nThose tears were genuine, and they represented a loss Prince could never have imagined when he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U in the middle of his Purple Rain hot streak.\n\nO'Connor's mother had died in a car crash in 1986, when the singer was still a teenager. They had not had an easy relationship. O'Connor later accused her of being mentally and physically abusive. But when she sang Prince's final verse, all that grief came flooding back.\n\n\"All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard / All died when you went away/ I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard / But I'm willing to give it another try.\"\n\nThat's the moment that prompted those tears.\n\n\"I didn't know I was going to cry when I sang in the video because I didn't cry in the studio recording it,\" she later recalled.\n\n\"[But] every time I sing that song I think of my mother. I never stop crying for my mother. I couldn't face being in Ireland for 13 years because of it.\"\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

In her 2021 memoir, she said he told her off for swearing in interviews, then challenged her to a pillow fight, only to bash her with something hard he'd slipped into his pillowcase.\n\nDespite that, she still held Nothing Compares 2U in great reverence,\n\n\"It's really about emotions, it's not about notes,\" she told BBC 6 Music in 2016.\n\n\"I think I'm probably similar to millions of people who loved the song, and we're all people who associated the song with a loss of some kind.\"\n\nThe High Court ruled that some lawsuits had been submitted too late to proceed\n\nHugh Grant is set to take the Sun newspaper on in court over claims it used illegal methods to gather stories about him.\n\nThe actor believes private investigators working for the Sun tapped his phone, bugged his house and car, and burgled his home.\n\nThe Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) unsuccessfully argued his action should be blocked because he waited too long to launch it.\n\nNGN denies the claims against it.\n\nA judge was asked to rule on whether Mr Grant's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed because it dates back further than six years, the cut-off point for legal action of this kind in civil courts.\n\nThis time limitation has become a major legal battleground in cases against newspapers, because allegations of wrongdoing often go back 30 years.\n\nPublishers attempt to argue that cases should not go to trial because alleged victims of unlawful newsgathering delayed their legal action.\n\nBut Mr Grant argued he should be allowed to bring the case now because material he and his lawyers will rely on only came to light in recent years.\n\nSome of the evidence against the newspaper was contained in a 2021 witness statement made by private investigator Gavin Burrows.\n\nIt was only when NGN disclosed invoices for their payments to Mr Burrows around the same time that Mr Grant had access to potential evidence which could help him win his case in court.\n\nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Fancourt acknowledged that the 62-year-old actor and privacy campaigner had long believed that private investigators had been paid to look into his affairs.\n\nThe judge said there was a realistic chance Mr Grant would establish at trial that, before seeing the 2021 evidence, \"he could not reasonably have believed with sufficient confidence that he may have been targeted by [private investigators] instructed by the Sun\".\n\nThis judgment does not mean the issue of whether Mr Grant's claim is too late has been decided, but it will now be considered at the trial next year.\n\nIn a statement released through his lawyer, Mr Grant said: \"I am pleased that my case will be allowed to go to trial, which is what I have always wanted - because it is necessary that the truth comes out about the activities of the Sun.\n\n\"As my case makes clear, the allegations go far wider and deeper than voicemail interception.\"\n\nMr Grant's statement in the case claims that for years newspaper published News UK lied about its involvement in phone hacking and illegal information gather", "ing.\n\nNurses protest during a strike by NHS medical workers outside University College London Hospital in London\n\nMeanwhile, in England a 5% pay rise from April has been offered to NHS staff including nurses and ambulance workers.\n\nIn addition, staff have been offered a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655 to top up the past year's pay award.\n\nUnions are recommending members back the deal, after nearly two weeks of talks with ministers, raising hopes the bitter dispute may be coming to an end.\n\nThe offer covers all NHS staff except doctors, who are on a different contract.\n\nIt comes after a winter of industrial action, with nurses, ambulance staff and physios all striking.\n\nThe unions put further action on hold, after the two sides agreed to discussions last month.\n\nJason, six-months old, is currently up for adoption at All Dogs Matter\n\nIllegal imports of puppies have continued to thrive following the pandemic, a study into UK purchasing practices suggests.\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College says the rise means dogs are at risk of being exposed to infectious diseases and a \"very impoverished environment\".\n\nThe report highlights other irresponsible practices from breeders such as only offering online viewings.\n\nThe government said buyers must go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre.\n\nThe rise in puppy smuggling came amid a surge in demand for puppies during the coronavirus lockdowns, with prices in some areas more than doubling to an average of almost \u00a31,900 each.\n\nIn a study published on Thursday in the journal Animals and shared with the BBC, the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) highlighted trends in puppy purchasing across the UK.\n\nDr Rowena Packer, first author of the study, said the rise in imported puppies was concerning.\n\nThe study estimates 10% of puppies purchased in 2021 were imported, more than double the figure from 2019.\n\nBabaloo's owner, Ms Papantoni, describes her as \"a very lovely, happy, energetic, kind, sensitive, and a bit of a naughty dog\"\n\nIn December 2020, Vasiliki Papantoni, in London, legally imported a puppy from Serbia after carefully planning the dog's journey to the UK.\n\nShe said the breeder had a \"good reference\" from a friend and provided lots of paperwork.\n\nMs Papantoni said she started her search for a puppy in the UK, but found that waiting lists were \"very long\".\n\nShe said a previous attempt to purchase a puppy in the UK ended in her being \"scammed\" when a breeder stopped contact after receiving a \u00a3300 deposit.\n\nDr Packer warns not all imported puppies receive good care when taken across Europe. \"These could be puppies that were transported for several days without appropriate provisions, rest, food, water,\" she said.\n\nThe RVC say puppies brought into the UK are \"often under the minimum legal age\" of 15 weeks, unlike Babaloo.\n\nThe organisation asked UK puppy purchasers the same questions over three years via an online survey. They analysed 1,148 responses from 2019, 4,369 from 2020 and 2,080 from 2021.\n\nDr Packer warns \"poor welfare sources\" also exist within the UK, such as \"a breeder or a dealer or somebody who produces puppies without due regard to their health and welfare\".\n\n\"You can very rapidly and cheaply rear a puppy if you don't care about some of those factors,\" she said.\n\nIntroduced in April 2020, 'Lucy's Law' requires puppies bred in England be shown with their mother and purchased from the place they were born.\n\nThe law does not apply to rescue and rehoming organisations, Defra said.\n\nDr Marc Abraham OBE, a vet, founded the campaign. He calls it a \"first step in combating irresponsible breeding and selling practices\".\n\nBut he adds it was overshadowed by the pandemic.\n\nIra Moss, founder of charity All Dogs Matter, says she knows of multiple puppy purchasers who were only shown pictures of the dog's parents, or were not allowed into the property where they were said to have been born.\n\nThe RVC's study estimates people purchasing puppies in 2021 \"were more likely to rely on online viewings, rather than in person, and to collect the puppy from outside the breeder's property\".\n\nIn 2019, only 7% of respondents viewed the puppy they purchased via a live video call. In 2021, the figure was 18%.\n\nThe pandemic restrictions still in effect for parts of 2021 may have factored into that year's figure.\n\nDr Abraham says the pandemic also led to a \"huge surge in demand\" for dogs, pushing up the price for a puppy and leading to more first time owners.\n\nHe adds: \"There's so many inexperienced dog owners around that I'm not not sure people did enough investment in how to look after a dog.\"\n\nIn turn, he warns this has led to a \"spike in dogs being abandoned\".\n\nIn October 2022, RSPCA data showed the charity had seen a 25% rise in abandonment cases.\n\nAll Dogs Matter says the rescue sector now faces a \"rehoming crisis\". Ms Moss explains \"there are too many dogs, not enough spaces\".\n\nFurthermore, the cost of living crisis means \"charities are losing money with less donations coming in\".\n\nDr Abraham says \"rescue shelters have rules for a reason\".\n\n\"Please don't think\u2026if they say no, that you should then go online and have a puppy delivered,\" he added.\n\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"Buyers must do their research and ensure they go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre when looking for a pet.\n\n\"We are committed to delivering the Kept Animals Bill measures individually, including on puppy smuggling, during the remainder of this Parliament and look forward to progressing these. We will be setting out next steps in due course.\"\n\nOil prices have risen after Saudi Arabia said it would make cuts of a million barrels per day (bpd) in July.\n\nOther members of Opec+, a group of oil-producing countries, also agreed to continued cuts in production in an attempt to shore up flagging prices.\n\nOpec+ accounts for around 40% of the world's crude oil and its decisions can have a major impact on oil prices.\n\nIn Asia trade on Monday, Brent crude oil rose by as much as 2.4% before settling at around $77 a barrel.\n\nOpec+ said production targets would drop by a further 1.4 million bpd from 2024.\n\nThe seven hour-long meeting on Sunday of the oil-rich nations came against a backdrop of falling energy prices.\n\nOil prices soared when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but are now back at levels seen before the conflict began.\n\nIn October last year Opec+, a formulation which refers to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, agreed to cut production by two million bpd, about 2% of global demand.\n\nIn April this year the group agreed to a further cuts, which were due to last to the end of this year. But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to \"the extension of the deal until the end of 2024\".\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. \"This is a Saudi lollipop,\" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market.\n\nBefore the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise. As the leader of the pack, and also the largest exporter of oil, it was the only one in a position to be able to lower output.\n\nFrom Riyadh's point", "for the 37 acts competing, will begin at the beginning of May, and Waddingham told BBC News she's looking forward to the results the most.\n\n\"It's the age-old Terry Wogan and Katie Boyle saying 'Good evening Portugal' - that literally gives me shivers of excitement,\" she said.\n\n\"My 12-year-old self couldn't believe I'd ever be saying that.

The two one-off payments for 22/23 we don't believe will create future inflationary pressures.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added the rise for the coming year would also not stoke inflation, since \"5% is broadly in line with pay growth in the wider economy so we don't see it having an impact on private sector pay which ultimately leads to inflation\".\n\nAnd when asked whether the money to fund the rise would have to come from the existing NHS/Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) budget the spokesperson insisted frontline service would not suffer and discussions were taking place between the DHSC and the Treasury.\n\nWhen asked about further money for the NHS to fund the deal, the spokesperson again said discussions would take place with the Treasury.\n\nHowever, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting criticised the \"last minute\" nature of the offer, calling the government \"incompetent\" and saying Mr Barclay \"doesn't know how he's going to pay for it\".\n\n\"Even when they arrive at a solution it's so late that it causes a new wave of problems.\"\n\nNHS staff have seen pay rise by an average of 4.75% during 2022-23 - with the lowest paid receiving the biggest rises - but unions had been asking for above-inflation rises, which at one point, would have equated to an increase of more than 14%.\n\nThe one-off payment to top up that pay award starts at \u00a31,655 for the lowest-paid staff such as cleaners and porters and rises to just over \u00a32,400 for the most senior front-line roles such as nurse consultants.\n\nFor staff in management positions, such as directors of nursing and chief finance officers, the one-off payment is worth up to \u00a33,789.\n\nThe government had originally offered 3.5% from April, for the 2023-24 financial year - but during the talks, ministers agreed to 5%. The lowest paid will receive more.\n\nMatthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said health leaders would \"breathe a sigh of relief\". \"We now await the decision of union members,\" he said.\n\nHe also urged the British Medical Association to enter talks - junior doctors staged a three-day walkout this week, in their fight for a 35% pay rise.\n\nThey say this is needed to make up for below-inflation wages rises over the past 15 years - but ministers say it is unaffordable.\n\nMinisters have offered the BMA talks on the same basis as with the other unions - but it has declined.\n\nStrike action has also been paused in Wales and Scotland by most unions while new offers are considered. The GMB in Scotland has accepted the Scottish offer, worth 14% over two years.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It is an issue that is emotionally charged like few others. And particularly now as war in Europe again looms large.\n\nBoth sides accuse each other of irrational ideology.\n\nConservative commentators and politicians say the country is in thrall to Green Party dogma, that scraps domestic nuclear power at a time when cutting Russian energy means rising prices. They accuse the government of increasing reliance on fossil fuels instead of using nuclear, which has lower emissions.\n\n\"It's a black day for climate protection in Germany,\" said Jens Spahn, conservative CDU MP, on RTL television earlier this week.\n\nThere have been attempts to rid Germany of nuclear power for decades\n\nGreens and left-wingers argue that it is illogical to cling to nuclear power, which is more expensive than wind or solar. The government argues that keeping the three ageing atomic power stations online would need huge investment \u2014 funds that should go into renewable energy sources.\n\nIt is odd for the CDU to suddenly champion climate protection, say Green Party MPs, given that the conservatives regularly block measures to expand renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nIronically, given the CDU's current fight for nuclear, it was a conservative-led government under Angela Merkel that decided to phase out atomic power after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Her decision was popular with voters, coming on the back of widespread anti-nuclear sentiment sparked by the catastrophe. Cynics suggest that upcoming key regional elections may have influenced her decision.\n\nToday, Germany gets almost half of its electricity from renewables - 44% in 2022, according to the Federal Statistical Office - and just 6% from atomic power. Green economy minister Robert Habeck predicts that 80% of Germany's electricity will be renewable by 2030 and has pushed through laws to make it quicker and easier to build solar and wind farms.\n\nBut over the last year, the proportion of renewables has stagnated while CO2 emissions have increased, as Germany has been forced to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and use more coal instead of Russian gas. This has sparked even some Green voters and anti-nuclear activists to support temporarily extending the lifespan of the last three nuclear power stations.\n\nIn an article published in Friday's edition of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Green Party environment minister Steffi Lemke wrote that Germany was shutting down nuclear because catastrophic accidents can never be ruled out, \"whether it be through human error like Chernobyl, natural disasters like Fukushima\u2026 or attacks, as Ukraine is suffering because of Russia's war\".\n\nGermany does not need nuclear, she argues, because renewables are safer, more sustainable, better for the climate and make more economic sense.\n\nDespite predictions of shortages and blackouts, Germany produces more energy than it needs, exporting energy to France over the summer, note Green Party leaders pointedly, where nuclear power stations could not operate because of extreme weather.\n\nVoters are divided. According to this week's ARD-DeutschlandTrend poll, 59% of Germans are against shutting down atomic energy, with only 34% in favour. Support for nuclear is strongest amongst older and conservative voters.\n\nBut more detailed questioning reveals a nuanced picture. In a YouGov poll from earlier this week, 65% supported keeping the three remaining nuclear power stations running for now. But only 33% wanted Germany to keep nuclear power indefinitely. In other words, pull the plug - but just not quite yet.\n\nMany supporters of nuclear power argue it is a cleaner fuel than some other options\n\nOn Thursday, the conservative leader of Bavaria Markus S\u00f6der visited Isar 2, and called for Germany to not only keep the last three reactors online, but also to reactivate old power stations - including one shut down in Bavaria by him.\n\nMeanwhile Christian Lindner, finance minister and head", "foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term\".\n\nBut it also describes China under Communist Party rule as an \"epoch-defining and systemic challenge... across almost every aspect of national life and government policy\".\n\nIt says the government will engage \"constructively\" with Beijing on shared priorities but where the Chinese government's actions threaten the UK's interests \"we will take swift and robust action to protect them\".\n\nFormer Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the Tory MPs calling for the government to take a tougher line on China, said he was \"confused\" about what the government's position was.\n\n\"Does that now mean that China is a threat or an epoch-defining challenge or a challenging government epoch or none of that?\" he asked in the Commons.\n\nMr Lammy said the updated review was \"overdue\" but welcome.\n\n\"The initiative to improve understanding of China in government is vital, particularly given the Foreign Office has only been training 14 people a year to speak fluent Mandarin,\" he added.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris spoke to the media after meeting the main Stormont parties\n\nThe secretary of state has hit back at accusations that he had set out a \"punishment budget\".\n\nHe was responding to claims from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that it was \"wrong for people to punish people of Northern Ireland\".\n\nThe secretary of state said Stormont can repay a \u00a3300m budget overspend across two years rather than one.\n\nRepaying the 2022-23 overspend over a longer period will \"provide some protection to frontline public services\", he said.\n\nBut he added departments still faced difficult decisions \"in order to live within the funding available\".\n\nStormont officials have been planning for budget cuts of at least \u00a3500m in cash terms in this financial year - most Stormont departments will have their budgets cut in cash terms.\n\n\"The purpose was not to punish anybody with this budget - it's to make sure services can continue in the absence of devolved government,\" said Mr Heaton-Harris.\n\nAsked what else he could offer the DUP given that its stance on re-entering Stormont has not changed, he replied: \"Let's see where talks lead to.\"\n\nDUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had \"real concerns about the lack of allocations within the budget for pay awards\".\n\n\"There are major challenges here and we are concerned about the way the Northern Ireland Office is handling things,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what the secretary of state described as a flat budget.\n\n\"Of course I want to see Stormont back up and running but it needs to be on a stable foundation.\"\n\nHe said going back to Stormont was not a \"quick fix\".\n\nThe Department of Health, the largest department, is receiving an allocation of \u00a37.25bn for day-to-day spending - similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThis \"flat cash\" funding will likely be viewed as a difficult settlement for the department, given the current high rate of inflation and outstanding pay demands.\n\nCompared with last year's budget figures the amount of money going to Education, Justice and Economy - the biggest spending departments - has been cut slightly in cash terms.\n\nEducation will get \u00a32.57bn, down from \u00a32.64bn, Justice will get \u00a31.12bn, down from \u00a31.14bn, while Economy will get \u00a3772m, down from \u00a3780m.\n\nThis budget could have been worse. But make no mistake, it is still likely to mean deteriorating public services for NI citizens.\n\nThe blow has been softened a little by allowing last year's \u00a3300m overspend to be repaid over two years instead of one.\n\nThe repayments will be drawn from any new money sent from Westminster later this year rather than being immediately chopped from departmental funds.\n\nBut that will present a significant challenge to the senior civil servants currently running Stormont.\n\nThere is an expectation that the UK government will eventually provide extra money to settle public sector pay disputes in England.\n\nThat will automatically mean extra funding for Stormont.\n\nBut that raises the prospect that the senior officials will then have to tell their workforces that they will not get a pay deal to match England because the overspend comes first.\n\nThat is not a recipe for industrial peace.\n\nRead more from John here.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the overspend would be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury.\n\nShould this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages.\n\nIt is understood that the possibility of drawing on a funding stream known as financial transactions capital (FTC) is being considered.\n\nThis is a conditional form of capital funding which Stormont consistently underspends.\n\nThe Treasury would have to agree that FTC could be used in this way.\n\nNo new money-raising policies, such as water charges, were advanced by the Northern Ireland secretary.\n\nHe repeated that lower levels of revenue generation but higher public-service provision in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK was \"unsustainable\".\n\nNew legislation to allow the UK government to explore options for increasing budget sustainability has also been introduced.\n\nIt will work with the Northern Ireland Civil Service to review areas for further revenue raising.\n\nIn Belfast on Wednesday people protested against budget cuts\n\nStormont can expect more money if the UK government allocates new funding to settle public sector pay deals in England.\n\nBut if that money must be used to reduce the overspend, it could be very difficult for senior officials to offer similar pay deals to public servants in Northern Ireland unless savings are found in other areas.\n\nUlster University economist Esmond Birney said the budget presented a tough challenge for the Stormont departments.\n\nHe described allowing the overspend to be paid down over two years as being the least worst option, compared to doing it immediately which \"would have implied very large spending cuts in this year\".\n\nOn Wednesday the head of Stormont's civil service, Jayne Brady, warned that the \"damage\" caused by the proposed budget reductions would be unprecedented.\n\nWriting to Mr Heaton-Harris's office, she outlined her \"profound concern\" about senior civil servants being placed in \"harmful decision-making positions\" about which services should be cut.\n\nIt was a rare and significant intervention, and one not typically made by senior civil servants.\n\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the budget would be \"brutal for public services\".\n\nHe said civil servants would be put in an \"incredibly difficult position when deciding on how to apply severe cuts\".\n\nHe called for a restored executive and a review of how Northern Ireland is financed.\n\nThe secretary of state hosted round table talks with parties in Northern Ireland\n\nThe Stormont political parties met Mr Heaton-Harris on Thursday afternoon about the budget.\n\nThey are not in government due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont, which began in February 2022.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's former Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the budget would devastate public services.\n\n\"The absence of an executive is really reprehensible at this stage when this is the outcome for people we represent,\" he said.\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the budget did not contain \"any flexibility\".\n\n\"It's quite grim, if I'm really honest, but it's been put to us and it's difficult to do anything without a government up and running,\" he said.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member Andrew Muir described the discussions as \"grim and truly bleak\".\n\nHe expressed concern that it would be left to civil servants to take decisions about cuts and said that was \"entirely wrong\".\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Matthew O'Toole described the meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris as concerning.\n\nHe said the budget would mean \"a real squeeze on public services\" imposed on people in Northern Ireland that they did not deserve, ask or vote for.\n\nPermanent secretaries - top civil servants - have been running Northern Ireland's nine departments since October but their powers are severely limited.\n\nThey can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians and their ability to react to changing circumstances is negligible.\n\nDepartments have been operating without proper budgets since the start of the financial year in April.\n\nThe pub closed on 1 May and Mrs R", "ally Pendreigh took this picture of Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh from Braid Hills.\n\nJulie Izon-Williams took this photo on May Day on the cliffs at Burrowhead, Isle of Whithorn.

New guidelines on social media demanded an \"extra responsibility\" for presenters with a \"high profile\". Some described the new rule as the \"Lineker clause\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Twitter is awash with examples of what some people think are presenters who have gone too far over recent years. Names frequently raised include Alan Sugar, Chris Packham and Andrew Neil.\n\nIn response, Mr Davie said on Saturday evening that he was in \"listening mode\" and suggested there might be an escape route by re-examining those guidelines.\n\nThere is good reason for him to want to bring this to a conclusion.

WATCH: How the Match of the Day row played out on Saturday... in 60 seconds\n\nMatch of the Day went ahead on BBC One on Saturday night - but was reduced to a 20-minute edition that did not have a presenter, pundits or any commentary - while other football coverage was dropped.\n\nEvery cancelled programme is a source of further complaint from licence payers who may not care what Lineker says on Twitter but care deeply about their favourite programmes staying on air on a Saturday night.\n\nThere is also the wider context of a government that has in recent years been critical of the BBC and its perceived liberal bias.\n\nGreg Dyke, a former director general, who left the BBC over a clash with the Labour Government in 2004, says the decision to pull Gary Lineker from Match of the Day looks like a corporation bowing to political pressure from a Tory government.\n\nAll of which leads to another issue that asks questions of the BBC's impartiality, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, a former donor to the Conservative party who is the subject of an ongoing inquiry looking in to his appointment and what he did or did not disclose about his part in the arrangement of an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee to the former prime minister, Boris Johnson.

O'Donoghue told the media that his bandmate had taken a break to spend time with his family.\n\nHe explained to Sunday World that the group were supportive of Sheehan's decision and described them as a \"a band of brothers\" who \"stick together no matter what\".\n\nIn 2013, The Script had a brush with royalty, when the Queen visited the BBC's Broadcasting House and watched a performance by The Script, briefly chatting with singer O'Donoghue.\n\nSheehan said when he was told about the royal engagement, he thought \"people were playing a joke on us\".\n\nThe Script are scheduled to support the American artist P!nk during her European tour later this year.\n\nThree people have been arrested by detectives investigating the murder of a woman outside a Merseyside pub on Christmas Eve.\n\nElle Edwards, 26, was shot in the head while celebrating with friends at The Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village.\n\nA man and a woman, both 23, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, Merseyside Police said.\n\nThomas Waring, 20, was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender.\n\nMr Waring, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, is due to appear at Wirral Adult Remand Court on Thursday.\n\nThe man, from Heswall, and woman, from Tranmere, have been released on bail.\n\nConnor Chapman, 22, has already been charged with murdering Ms Edwards and is due to go on trial on 7 June.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

It's something I'm excited but nervous about because England has been my life for the last 10 years.\"\n\nShe credits her \"dual career\" with Cloud Direct for giving her the \"choice of when and how I can retire from professional rugby on my terms.\n\nCornborough was the second England player, after lock Abbie Ward, to announce a pregnancy after the Rugby Football Union (RFU) updated its maternity policy in February 2023.\n\nPreviously, the RFU did not have a maternity policy designed specifically for players.\n\nCornborough, who was elected vice-chair of the Rugby Players Association in 2019, becoming the first woman to hold an RPA leadership role, described the old policy as \"not fit for purpose\".\n\nShe is also keen to celebrate the different paths that she and Abbie Ward have taken on their journeys to motherhood.\n\n\"I'm a very private person and I didn't want it going out everywhere, there are so many emotions,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to control my own narrative.\"\n\nWeeks before Cornborough gave birth to her twin daughters, her sister Sam, who also has two young children, was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nCornborough is an ambassador for Rugby Against Cancer and took part in cancer charity Macmillan's Brave the Shave campaign, raising more than \u00a35,000.\n\n\"She had quite an aggressive form of cancer - she had to have a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy,\" said Cornborough.\n\n\"She's just completed chemo - she's an absolute trooper. She was worried about losing her hair and losing her anonymity. I said: 'Why don't I lose my hair as well?'\n\n\"My hair used to be down to my waist. I've now sent it to the Little Princess Trust.\"\n\nThe government first promised guidance for schools in relation to transgender pupils more than five years ago.\n\nAnd while the Department for Education (DfE) says it will finally publish new guidance for schools in England this term, for many this cannot come soon enough.\n\nFinding a school willing to talk about its transgender policies is almost impossible.\n\nBBC News contacted head teachers across England but almost all were too anxious to be interviewed on camera. They did not want to draw attention to their school - or pupils who identify as trans or non-binary.\n\nIn 2018, the government said it would work with the human-rights watchdog to publish \"comprehensive guidance for schools on how to support trans pupils\". Without it, many schools are making their own decisions, such as whether to introduce gender-neutral toilets or changing rooms - and how they are used.\n\nSome teachers told BBC News they worried whatever they did would \"not only be criticised but publicly vilified\" and, while schools needed clarity, it was a \"no-win\" situation.\n\nOthers said they might have to consult solicitors, amid fears of doing the \"wrong thing\".\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton told BBC News many schools wanted better guidance and advice to help make decisions \"in the best interests of the child\".\n\nHis, Chesterfield High School, a mixed-sex comprehensive in Crosby, Merseyside, has developed its own approach.\n\nThe school has more than 1,200 pupils, 10-20 of whom identify as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid.\n\nThere are single-sex and gender-neutral toilets, with floor-to-ceiling lockable cubicles and a supervising member of staff. And private PE changing rooms, used by all the trans pupils, are available to all.\n\nThe school's support for children questioning their gender identity had been developed over the past decade, Mr Sexton said.\n\n\"We've tried to create a school that's tolerant and inclusive,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll work with individual children to actually think about what they want to use and access - and it becomes really manageable.\"\n\nChesterfield High had never faced a challenge from parents - but other head teachers had.\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton says everyone should feel safe and happy at school\n\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked almost 7,000 teachers in England a series of questions about their experience with transgender pupils.\n\nAbout 8% of primary-school teachers said they taught trans or non-binary pupils, compared with 75% in secondary.\n\nAnd just over half said they would not be very or at all confident about the next steps to take if a child wanted to change their name, use different pronouns or change their appearance, hairstyle or clothes - what is known as socially transitioning.\n\nWhen and how schools should involve parents if a child wishes to identify as a gender different to their birth sex - and what to do if a parent disagrees - are among the most controversial matters the guidance is expected to address.\n\nEvery classroom at Chesterfield High School has a pride flag\n\nA report into gender-identity services in England says socially transitioning may have significant psychological effects - and better information is needed about its outcomes.\n\nAnd last year, an NHS England consultation proposed socially transitioning should be considered in certain circumstances only, such as to alleviate or prevent \"clinically significant distress\".\n\nAbout three-quarters of the teachers in the Teacher Tapp survey said their school would support a child who wished to socially transition.\n\nAnd 39% of the secondary teachers who responded said they would support this, regardless of parental consent.\n\n\"Everyone involved in a child's life should work together and investigate why a child may feel a certain way,\" says Tanya Carter, of the Safe Schools Alliance organisation, which is worried about how some schools are managing gender identity.\n\n\"Teachers are not doctors. [Socially transitioning] is something that should only be done with medical oversight. Concerns arise when schools affirm someone as the opposite sex, locking in what may or not may not be a transient phase in that child's life.\"\n\nThe organisation receives several messages every day from both parents and teachers worried about toilets, changing rooms, sports and overnight accommodation on school trips becoming mixed-sex.\n\n\"We get parents who have found out that their children have been socially transitioned behind their backs at schools, because the schools haven't spoken to parents,\" Miss Carter says. \"Schools are keeping secrets from parents.\"\n\nPenni Allen, who runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, says the school takes parents' views into account but that \"doesn't mean that we're not going to continue supporting that child\".\n\nThe school tries to de-escalate any emotions and issues with parents and help the child understand what they are feeling.\n\n\"Some children will come and say they're just exploring,\" Mrs Allen says. \"Others will say they've been feeling this way for quite some time. They might just be at the start of a journey that never goes anywhere.\n\n\"It's not about putting them on a pathway. We don't put your child in a box and put a label on it that says, 'Your child is now trans.'\n\n\"We like to think we've got a good relationship with parents here\u2026 and hopefully, we get it right.\"\n\nPenni Allen runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, where pupils can talk to counsellors about difficulties, including around gender identity\n\nBBC News spoke to parents of trans children at other schools in England but, as with teachers, it is difficult to find a view everyone agrees with and will speak about on record.\n\nSome parents told BBC News they did not want any decisions made without their approval and were not happy with their children changing their names or pronouns.\n\nSome felt their children may be struggling with their sexual orientation, rather than gender identity, and needed space and time to explore that before making other decisions, which could potentially lead down a medical pathway such as puberty blockers.\n\nBut others wanted schools to put their child's choices first, regardless of their own involvement, and were supportive of their trans identity and socially transitioning.\n\nThe decisions schools make, or do not make, can have a huge impact on the young people affected.\n\nEllie, 18, was the first pupil to publicly identify as", ", who chairs the Broadcasting Press Guild, said: \"As an organisation of journalists, the BPG is always among the first to see the value of great interviewing - and these BBC radio interviews were game-changing for Liz Truss and her doomed government.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the PM's feet were held to the fire in these eight radio sessions in a way that stood out among so much drama that was happening in British politics last summer.\"\n\nThe BBC's controller local audio commissioning, Chris Burns, said: \"It really was an iconic moment in local radio and also for how we work digitally, as the interviews were then packaged up into the most popular Newscast episode of all time for BBC Sounds.\n\n\"Our presenters - as they always do - were speaking for the communities they serve, as well as the whole country when they asked those questions. That is the beauty of local audio.\n\n\"We are immensely proud of everything local BBC radio does and it's fantastic to see the work acknowledged with this award.\"\n\nThe BPG ceremony, in London later, comes a week after staff on the BBC's regional TV bulletins and local radio and online output in England staged a 24-hour strike over the corporation's plan for its 39 local radio stations in England to broadcast more merged shows in the afternoons, evenings and at weekends.\n\nThe National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has said it will \"undermine already hollowed out local-radio content across England\".\n\nBut the BBC has said its proposal will \"modernise local services across England - including more news journalists and a stronger local online service - which will see no overall reduction in staffing levels or local funding\".\n\nThe Vietnamese migrants travelled by ferry from Belgium to Purfleet, before the trailer was opened in Grays\n\nA Romanian man has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants who were found suffocated in a sealed lorry trailer.\n\nThe victims, including 10 teenagers, were discovered in Essex in 2019.\n\nMarius Mihai Draghici also admitted one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration at a hearing at the Old Bailey.\n\nThe 50-year-old was remanded in custody and Judge Richard Marks KC said he would be sentenced at a later date.\n\nDraghici was detained in Romania last August following the execution of a European Arrest Warrant and was extradited to the UK.\n\nThe 39 people who died in the back of a trailer as it crossed the North Sea between Zeebrugge and the UK\n\nThe bodies of the 39 people were found in Grays on 23 October 2019, after the lorry had travelled by boat from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet on the Thames estuary.\n\nAn inquest heard their medical cause of death was asphyxia and hyperthermia, as temperatures rose in the back of the sealed lorry container and oxygen levels dropped.\n\nEach of the lorry victims, and their families, had paid significant sums of money to an organised criminal group that promised a better life and safe passage to the UK.\n\nDet Ch Insp Louise Metcalfe said it was \"the most complex investigation ever undertaken by Essex Police\".\n\n\"We have always maintained that the actions we believed Draghici was responsible for could never go unpunished. We now know they will not,\" she added.\n\nPolice said Draghici's role was to be involved in the onward transportation of the migrants once they arrived in the UK.\n\nFour men have been previously jailed over the deaths.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

No fingerprints were left behind and no alarm went off, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\nThey were found in a sting operation launched by the FBI's art crime team. The case is being handled by federal prosecutors in North Dakota and the FBI's Minneapolis Division.\n\nThe red shoes are central to The Wizard of Oz. When Dorothy clicks the heels of the shoes together and says \"there's no place like home\" she is transported back to Kansas.\n\nCharging documents released on Tuesday contained no information about what led to Mr Martin's arrest. On Wednesday, he told a reporter for the Minneapolis Star Tribune: \"I gotta go on trial. I don't want to talk to you.\"\n\nThe newspaper notes that Mr Martin lives about 12 miles (19km) from the museum, which is located at the childhood home of Judy Garland.\n\nMuseum executive director Janie Heitz said she does not think the suspect was ever an employee of the museum.\n\nThe treasured items of Hollywood memorabilia have been valued at $3.5m (\u00a32.8m), said the US Attorney's Office for the District of North Dakota, adding that they were insured for $1m when they were stolen nearly 18 years ago.\n\nAnother pair of the red sequined slippers are at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and another pair was acquired in 2012 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe stolen slippers are still in the custody of the FBI.\n\n\"Until the court cases are done, nothing can be done with them,\" the museum wrote on Facebook.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

We encourage our students to reach out to their faculties should they have any queries or concerns.\"\n\nIn a joint statement with her fellow sabbatical officers, new students' union president at Cardiff University Angie Flores Acu\u00f1a said the graduation disruption marked \"another failure for students\".\n\nThe petition said the support of students for those striking had been \"loud and clear\", adding: \"Cardiff University has the power to call for an end to this dispute by publicly supporting the reopening of negotiations.\"By standing back and doing nothing, Cardiff University is failing students who are finishing with provisional/no degrees despite having worked so hard throughout this unprecedented period.\"\n\nA Cardiff University spokesman said: \"The majority of our students will receive their marks, in full, and will not be affected\"\n\nThe petition calls on the university to reimburse tuition fees of those affected, retract pay deduction threats and engage in \"meaningful negotiations\" with striking staff.\n\nA Cardiff University spokesman confirmed some students would receive an unclassified degree \"for the time being\", and the university was \"currently unable to provide an outcome\" for some other degrees.\n\nThe university said it was \"painfully aware that those students who are affected are feeling deeply disappointed, worried and anxious\" and also confirmed it was aware of the petition started by the Cardiff students' union president.\n\n\"It is important to stress that this is a national dispute over levels of pay and working conditions. The University therefore cannot solve these issues independently,\" it said.\n\n\"We reject in the strongest possible terms any suggestion that we are standing back and doing nothing. The Vice-Chancellor has met with local representatives and we continue to keep communication channels open with Cardiff UCU and find there are many points of agreement between us.\n\n\"This type of language only serves to undermine the efforts of staff who have been doing everything possible, under extreme pressure and time constraints, to support those students most severely impacted.\"\n\nThe spokesman said graduation cer", "kraine has been planning a counter-offensive for months. But it has wanted as much time as possible to train troops and to receive military equipment from Western allies.\n\nIn the meantime, Russian forces have been preparing their defences.\n\nMuch is at stake because the government in Kyiv needs to show the people of Ukraine - and Western allies - that it can break through Russian lines, end the effective military deadlock and recapture some of its sovereign territory.\n\nMr Danilov said the armed forces would begin the assault when commanders calculated \"we can have the best result at that point of the war\".\n\nAsked if Ukrainian armed forces were ready for the offensive, he replied: \"We are always ready. The same as we were ready to defend our country at any time. And it is not a question of time.\n\n\"We have to understand that that historic opportunity that is given to us - by God - to our country we cannot lose, so we can truly become an independent, big European country.\"\n\nHe added: \"It could happen tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week.\n\n\"It would be weird if I were to name dates of the start of that or those events.

But you have to keep in mind that Bakhmut has played a big role in this war.\"\n\nAsked if Wagner mercenaries were leaving, he replied: \"Yes, that is happening.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available. In return for the invitation to talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices.

There the occupational health nurse asked her about antidepressants.\n\nMs Mackenzie said that she had believed that by this time Police Scotland, or its occupational health advisors, Optima Health, would have had access to her medical records.\n\nShe said that she was taking an antidepressant drug for anxiety and depression.\n\nThe nurse consulted a colleague and then advised her of a \"two year rule\" stipulating that probationary police officers had to be free of antidepressant drugs for a period of two years before they could be considered for employment.\n\nMs Mackenzie said she was \"heartbroken\" by this after being transparent with Police Scotland about her health.\n\nInsp Davidson called her and was said to be \"shocked and apologetic\" that she could not be passed fit for duty and that her application would be taken no further.\n\nTo make the situation worse Ms Mackenzie said the Highlands and Islands division announced, just weeks later, that it had secured funding for a three-year mental health and wellbeing project for officers and staff.\n\nPolice Scotland also confirmed a formal partnership with See Me, Scotland's programme to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination.\n\nMs Mackenzie went on to work as a nursing assistant in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nBut information she learned during her training and while seeking advice, together with a similar case reported by the Scottish Sun newspaper, prompted her to launch legal action.\n\nDespite being outside the usual time limit for making a complaint, a judge ruled that an employment tribunal could hear Ms Mackenzie's case.\n\nEmployment cases normally must be brought within three months, but submissions made by Ms Mackenzie's legal team led Judge Russell Bradley to allow the case to proceed.\n\nA preliminary hearing will now take place at a later date.\n\nMs Mackenzie's solicitor, Jay Lawson told BBC Scotland that this was one of a number of similar cases against Police Scotland, which he said was \"worrying in itself\".\n\nMr Lawson, from Dundee firm MML Law, added: \"This is a hugely important case for our client given everything she has been through but also for employees and candidates with disabilities who are discriminated against during the recruitment process.\n\n\"There is always a bigger picture in a case such as this, in relation to raising awareness.\n\n\"Ms Mackenzie instructed us following seeing one of our other cases against Police Scotland and perhaps would not have pursued the case without seeing this.\"\n\nWendy Halliday, director of mental health charity See Me, told BBC Scotland: \"While there's been real progress in recent years, we know that there is still work to do to address stigma and discrimination for Scotland's workers.\n\n\"We firmly believe that no one should be denied a role just because of their mental health, with no other consideration as to how they are, what they could bring to a role, or exploring reasonable adjustments, as required under the 2010 Equality Act, that would support them to carry out the role.\"\n\nLee Knifton, director of Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: \"We can't comment on individual cases but we know that people living with mental health conditions are still facing discrimination.\n\n\"We need employers to show leadership and ensure that their recruitment and workplace practices do not negatively affect people living with mental health conditions.\n\n\"Around one in six adults live with a common mental health disorder and we are continually learning more about mental health, so any policies in this area should be reviewed regularly to ensure that outdated practices are curbed.\" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage.\"\n\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

But others have supported the junta.\n\nNiger's coup is the latest in a wave of military takeovers that have hit the West African region in recent years, toppling governments in countries including Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nIt also comes as a big blow to the leadership of regional body Ecowas. Just two weeks ago, the bloc's chairman, President Bola Tinubu, warned that terrorism and the emerging pattern of coups in West Africa had reached alarming levels and demanded urgent, concerted actions.\n\nThis is the fifth coup in Niger since it gained independence from France in 1960, on top of other unsuccessful takeover attempts.\n\nWhy does the Bank of England keep raising rates?\n\nJames from Norwich notes that people are spending more because of high energy and food prices.

The road fully reopened shortly after 20:00.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Paul White said: \"Today, as you've seen, there's been a significant protest in relation to the running of the Grand National.\n\n\"This began earlier this morning. There's been a number of protests outside and then that resulted earlier on today at about 5pm with numerous people trying to incur onto the course, which we, in partnership with the event organisers, and members of the public as well, have managed in the main to stop and and ultimately the event took place - albeit with a slight delay.\"\n\nMr White said it required \"significant resource\" to cover the perimeter of Aintree, with protesters attempting to access the course from a number of points around the track.\n\nHe said police had a \"proportionate\" plan in place and were able to stop \"the vast majority\" from entering the course, and those who did were removed \"swiftly\".\n\nMr White added: \"We've had to uplift our resources significantly. Clearly we were very much aware there was a planned protest today.\n\n\"We always have a proportionate policing plan in place to manage the event and support event organisers, but because of the additional information and intelligence regarding protests we had to increase resources significantly for today.\"\n\nAfter the delay was announced on the racecourse public address system, the 39 participating horses were taken back to the pre-parade ring.\n\nThe jockeys were asked to re-mount their rides six minutes after the scheduled start time, with the race starting eight minutes later.\n\nDickon White, who runs the track as North West regional director for the Jockey Club, said the delay was caused by the \"reckless actions of a small number of individuals\".\n\nMerseyside Police thanked the public for their \"patience\" while they dealt with the protests.\n\nThe police had previously said they would deal \"robustly\" with any disruption after animal rights activists threatened to sabotage the race.\n\nAintree Racecourse warned that the actions of protestors could \"endanger the horses they purport to protect, as well as jockeys, officials and themselves\".\n\nSpeaking before protesters entered the track, Animal Rising spokesperson Nathan McGovern said: \"Police are wasting time chasing protesters rather than addressing the climate and ecological emergency, and our broken relationship to animals.\n\n\"We remain undeterred, and we will peacefully continue our actions to stop harm coming to animals at Aintree.\n\n\"Today marks", "Beach, including that a shark ate and later regurgitated body parts.\n\nPolice even considered throwing pig carcasses with running shoes on their trotters into the sea to determine how shark behaviour or ocean currents could have played a role, the inquest heard.\n\nAn orthopaedic surgeon told the inquest it was unlikely Caddick could have severed her own foot, as it would require \"significant force\" to cut through bone, cause major blood loss, and require specialist post-surgical care.\n\nBut scientists put forward a simple explanation at the inquest.\n\nOceanographers said currents could have easily carried the foot that distance, while a pathologist described how human feet can detach from bodies during decomposition.\n\nThe inquest also heard criticism of police handling of the case.\n\nOfficers assigned to the Caddick case stuck too closely to their view that she had voluntarily vanished, some said.\n\nPolice combed the cliffs in Dover Heights for any trace of Ms Caddick\n\nA crime scene examination of the house was not done until 19 days after Caddick disappeared, and a lawyer assisting the coroner questioned why the homicide squad wasn't brought in immediately, if only to rule out foul play.\n\nAnother detective expressed surprise that NSW Police only sought out the corporate watchdog's affidavit on Caddick - which outlined its case against her - some months after her disappearance.\n\nThe inquest was also told that Caddick had a life insurance policy, which included suicide cover, and had made a number of references to ending her life over the years - but police initially devoted limited resources to this line of inquiry.\n\nMagistrate Ryan on Thursday said the uncovering of Caddick's deception may have triggered a \"narcissistic injury\", with the illusion of her wealth and success shattered.\n\n\"The Asic investigation and search warrant very likely caused her a catastrophic level of shame and despair,\" she said.\n\n\"She may well have reached the conclusion that ending her life was the only option.\"\n\nBut the manner of her death will ultimately remain unresolved, she said.\n\nEqually unresolved are the losses of her clients, many of whom saw huge sums of money vanish.\n\n\"I sold my business as I was under the impression my money was safe, and I retired in 2017,\" one victim testified.\n\n\"To rub more salt in the wound she has also stolen my mother's money, wife's, mother-in-law, son, brother and sister\u2026 wiping out three generations of my family's savings.\"\n\nKate Forbes, who finished second to Humza Yousaf in the SNP leadership race, has announced that she is leaving the Scottish government.\n\nScotland's finance secretary was on maternity leave after the birth of her daughter when Nicola Sturgeon suddenly announced that she was quitting as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister.\n\nWithin a couple of days of confirming she would be standing in the contest to succeed her, Ms Forbes found herself at the centre of a political storm.\n\nHer views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, trans rights and having children outside of marriage were savaged by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who had been standing in for the deeply religious Ms Forbes since last July.\n\nMs Sturgeon herself also made thinly-veiled barbs at the woman she had appointed finance secretary at the age of 29, just hours before she had to deliver a budget speech.\n\nScotland is a progressive country, Ms Sturgeon stated, and the views of the next first minister therefore matter.\n\nMs Forbes saw several supporters desert her campaign in response to the furore, which was ignited when she told journalists that she would not have voted for gay marriage had she been an MSP at the time.\n\nShe subsequently told Sky News that she believed that having children outside of marriage is \"wrong\" according to her faith as a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, while stressing that: \"In a free society you can do what you want.\"\n\nMs Forbes has never hidden her religious beliefs, leaving pundits wondering why they had appeared to come as a shock to some of her supporters.\n\nThe Free Church, of which she is a devout follower, has strongly opposed gay marriage since it was legalised in Scotland in 2014.\n\nMs Forbes and her husband Ali celebrated the birth of daughter Naomi last year\n\nIn 2018, Ms Forbes spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland a day after a Westminster debate on abortion, when she called on politicians to \"recognise that the way we treat the most vulnerable - whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\n\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\n\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.\n\nSeveral senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.\n\nHumza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to \"progressive values\" and avoids a \"lurch to the right\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.\n\nMs Forbes told Mr Yousaf: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.\n\n\"What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?\"\n\nMs Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity\".\n\nThe remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the \"continuity candidate\", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.\n\nShe later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.\n\nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.\n\nHer parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was \"just down the road\".\n\nMs Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood\n\nShe went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.\n\nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School - an international residential school in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nShe went on to complete degrees at Cambridge University and Edinburgh University and became a chartered accountant for Barclays in London.\n\nShe worked as an assistant to the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, Dave Thompson, for two years before being selected to replace him when he stood down.\n\nOn the backbenches, the then 26-year-old campaigned to ban plastic straws and delivered a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic.\n\nIn 2018 she entered government as public finance minister working alongside Derek Mackay, who she would go on to succeed as finance secretary when he was forced to stand down just hours before delivering his budget speech after it emerged he had sent inappropriate text messages to a 16-year-old schoolboy.\n\nMs Forbes became Scotland's first female finance secretary and was widely praised for delivering the budget speech with just a few hours' notice, having only received the call from Ms Sturgeon at 7am that morning.\n\nShe has said the SNP needs to win over No voters by using the Scottish Parliament's existing powers to show that", "was \"brilliant\" although he did throw him for a loop by calling for a Ben E King classic.\n\n\"Towards the end, Bono just turned round and said 'let's do Stand By Me'. He just pulled that out of thin air, no warning whatsoever.\n\n\"It's four very simple chords, we just started winging it and then he just looked at me and said: 'You sing the next verse'.\n\n\"I was like, I have no idea what the lyrics are at all, so I said 'you just do it'.\"\n\nDespite these understandable hiccups, the concert was a major success and, of course, produced that iconic image.\n\nTim Wheeler says Belfast was \"a very different place to grow up\"\n\nWheeler remembered \"a great feeling of positivity\" after the concert that resonated with a band whose three founding members had lived all their lives under the shadow of the Troubles.\n\n\"Coming to Belfast always felt very edgy. The Army was everywhere, of course, and always bomb threats and incidents in our town.\n\n\"I do remember I was up in Belfast and saw a policeman had just been shot and was being covered in a body bag.\n\n\"Being children you just get on with it and think it's normal. And when we started travelling the world you realise it was a very different place to grow up.\"\n\nTwo decades on from that night, and the 1998 agreement referendum, devolved government in Northern Ireland is out of action.\n\nIt is a \"very sad\" situation, said Wheeler, but \"at least we're living in a time that's a lot more peaceful\".\n\nMaybe another star-studded night at the Waterfront could help?\n\n\"I wonder! he said with a laugh. \"Yeah, get it together - if a concert could work in a same way for that, we need to sit down and sort it out.\"\n\nYou can hear the full interview with Ash's Tim Wheeler on The Sunday News at 13:00 GMT on Sunday.\n\nThe crash caused damage to the road's barrier\n\nA lorry was left hanging off a bridge after crashing into a barrier on the M1 in Leicestershire.\n\nPolice were called to reports the vehicle had crashed on the southbound carriageway at junction 19 Catthorpe Interchange just after 04:30 BST.\n\nThe southbound carriageway was closed at junction 19 as well as both sides of the A14 while the vehicle was removed.

However... I do not consider the evidence enables a positive finding as to how she died, or when and where this happened,\" Deputy State Coroner Elizabeth Ryan wrote.\n\nFor most, the Melissa Caddick story began with the news that the seemingly successful financial adviser was missing.\n\nBut her life had actually begun to unravel months earlier when Australia's financial watchdog was tipped off that she had been using a friend's financial adviser's licence, having simply pasted in her own name on the document.\n\nRegulators suspect the 49-year-old stole up to $30m (\u00a315.8m; $19.5m) from more than 60 clients, including many of her family and friends, to help fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThere were overseas trips on private jets, high-end cars, designer clothes, and expensive jewellery.\n\nHer methods were not \"particularly complicated\", the coroner said.\n\nAs new clients gave her money to invest, she would pay some out as dividends to existing clients before keeping - and spending - the rest.\n\nCoroner Ryan said she was struck by the \"powerful impression of wealth and success\" Caddick made on her clients and would-be investors.\n\n\"Equally significant was the trust they had in her... almost all were either immediate family members, or close personal friends of herself and her family,\" she said.\n\nOne would-be investor recalled: \"I wanted to model myself and our family on successful people, and Melissa appeared to be successful\".\n\nBut everything fell apart on 11 November 2020 when police knocked on her door at dawn.\n\nThe last confirmed sighting of Melissa Caddick was by officers at the raid on her home.\n\nHer husband, Anthony Koletti, told police they believed she had gone for an early run the next morning. Her car and all her personal belongings had been left behind.\n\nBut she was not reported missing by Mr Koletti for more than 30 hours, and only after he had dialled in to a court hearing that she was due to attend and appeared surprised she had not turned up.\n\nPolice initially explored two theories - that Caddick was still alive and had gone into hiding to escape justice, or had taken her own life.\n\nBut the inquest heard how Mr Koletti, a hairdresser and part-time DJ, behaved erratically in the wake of his wife's disappearance, leading police to suspect he could be involved.\n\nMr Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes or any involvement in her disappearance, and police say they have uncovered no evidence to dispute that.\n\nAnthony Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes\n\nBut an investigator told the coroner's court Mr Koletti \"didn't appear to be overly concerned\" when his wife vanished.\n\nLead Detective Sergeant Michael Kyneur also said Mr Koletti had visited a cliff top area near their home and taken a photograph of a shoe print, an action the policeman described as \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"That's a dog park. It's like saying I found a footprint on Bondi beach.\"\n\nThe inquest also heard that Mr Koletti had sent texts from Caddick's phone pretending to be her, told police he was \"too busy\" to attend an interview, and gave conflicting versions of events.\n\nFor example, he was able to provide a description of what his wife was wearing on the morning she vanished, despite also saying he had not actually seen her, police said.\n\nMr Koletti had also recounted his version of events by releasing a musical concept album containing tracks with titles such as \"Melissa Is Missing\" and \"Above the Law\".\n\nIt was \"regrettable\" that Mr Koletti had not given a \"full and frank\" account of what had happened, Magistrate Ryan said on Thursday.\n\nThe case took a grisly twist in February 2021 with the discovery of a rotting, trainer-clad foot on a remote beach 500km (310 miles) south of Sydney.\n\nExperts matched the body part to Caddick through DNA, but an autopsy couldn't determine if it was separated by force or decomposition.\n\nThe inquest heard a slew of theories to explain how it ended at Bournda", "efforts \"politics of grievance\" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were \"worse\" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: \"First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.\n\n\"We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with \u00a350m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.\n\n\"But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.\"\n\nOrkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.\n\nThe islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.\n\nA spokesperson added it was \"committed to supporting island communities\".\n\nThe Norwegian government declined to comment on the proposals.\n\nToday's vote was never about Orkney becoming part of Norway, or any of the other headlines we've seen over recent days.\n\nRather it was a chance for councillors to express their extreme frustration with what they see as the unfair deal they get from the Scottish and UK governments, with council leader James Stockan saying the islands had been failed by both of them.\n\nThe successful passing of the motion is the first of many hurdles in Orkney gaining a degree of greater autonomy.\n\nCouncil officials will now be tasked with investigating options. Mr Stockan said that \"nothing was off the table\" - including of course the much-publicised return to Norway or Denmark.\n\nReaction to the vote on the streets of Kirkwall has been fairly mixed.\n\nSome don't want to see any tax-payer money devoted to what one councillor described as \"frankly bizarre fantasies\".\n\nOthers feel that the council does get a raw deal from both Holyrood and Westminster, and that anything that gets the two governments to sit up and pay attention is worth looking at.\n\nThe eyes of the global media have been on Orkney for the past few days.\n\nIt's now up to the islands council to capitalise on that attention.\n\nChinese authorities have warned of \"multiple natural disasters\" in the coming month, as heavy rains lash parts of the country.\n\nA weather alert is in place for large areas of central and southwestern China and thousands of people have been evacuated.\n\nA building collapsed into raging floodwaters in Chongqing.

If the government chooses not to do so, I will ask for these to be returned to my office so that I can provide them to you directly.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward said the risk of turning on Mr Johnson's old phone was \"minimal\", adding: \"It is perfectly possible to do that without exposing it to the potential threat.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the inquiry told the government to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic by 16:00 BST on Thursday.\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"more than happy\" to give the unredacted material to the inquiry.\n\nThe Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - also holds communications between ministers and civil servants which do not involve Mr Johnson.\n\nOn Thursday, it missed the deadline and said it would \"with regret\" be launching a judicial review of the demand, but promised to \"continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry\".\n\nDefending its decision not to hand over certain messages, the Cabinet Office argued that many of the communications were \"unambiguously irrelevant\", and that to submit them to the inquiry would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.\n\n\"It represents an unwarranted intrusion into other aspects of the work of government. It also represents an intrusion into their legitimate expectations of privacy and protection of their personal information,\" the Cabinet Office said, in a letter to the inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, science minister George Freeman said he thought the \"courts will probably take the view\" that Baroness Hallett was entitled to decide \"what evidence she deems relevant\".\n\nBut he added \"people's privacy is really important\" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a \"point worth testing\".\n\n\"I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid. We will redact it',\" he said.\n\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the government's legal action as a \"desperate attempt to withhold evidence\". The Liberal Democrats called it a \"kick in the teeth for bereaved families\".\n\nLord Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Theresa May, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the government was making a \"bad mistake\".\n\nHe added: \"We're having the inquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth. And if the government is controlling what the inquiry can and can't see, then people are not going to get confidence in the outcome.\"\n\nToby Burwell went missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon in February\n\nThe body of a missing 17-year-old boy has been recovered from a quarry in Warwickshire.\n\nPolice divers found the body in Newbold Quarry, Rugby, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe was formally identified as Toby Burwell, who had been missing from his home in Newbold-on-Avon since 20 February.\n\nHis death is not currently being treated as suspicious, Warwickshire Police said.\n\nA force spokesperson added: \"Our thoughts remain with Toby's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nPolice had been searching the water and land around Newbold Quarry since Toby's disappearance more than six weeks ago.\n\nThe 17-year-old was known to have previously gone swimming in the quarry at night.\n\nLast week, Warwickshire Police said the evidence gathered strongly suggested Toby had got into difficulty while swimming in the quarry and never left the water.\n\n\"At present, the evidence we have gathered strongly supports the conclusion that Toby went to Newbold Quarry alone for a swim and that, tragically, he got into difficulty and remains in the water,\" Det Insp Gareth Unett said in a statement agreed with Toby's family at the time.\n\nSpecialist search officers, police divers", "Park Authority said the organisation had \"decided to prioritise the Welsh name going forwards\".She added: \"The park is not asking other people or organisations to prioritise the Welsh name. This is an organisational decision and applies to all the work they do.\n\n\"Others are welcome to use whichever name they choose for the park.\"\n\nMolly-Mae Hague, pictured this year, left the Love Island villa as a finalist in 2019\n\nLove Island star Molly-Mae Hague has said she is stepping down from her role as creative director of fast fashion brand PrettyLittleThing after less than two years to focus on being a mum.\n\nThe influencer took on the reportedly big-money role in August 2021, before giving birth earlier this year.\n\nShe said while \"everything is going incredibly\" work-wise she wanted to commit fully to raising her daughter.\n\nThe 24-year-old will continue to work as a brand ambassador for the company.\n\nSpeaking on her YouTube channel, Hague - who met her partner, boxer Tommy Fury on the ITV2 dating show - said she would \"forever have the most insane relationship\" with her \"family\" at PrettyLittleThing (PLT).\n\n\"I am still working with them and doing collections and edits, but I have actually decided to step down as my creative director role,\" she said.\n\n\"Over the last few weeks, I have realised that I'm only going to get this time once with my first-born child and I'm only going to get Bambi being four months old once and I feel like I've had to rearrange my life a little bit and lose some commitments that I did have.\"\n\nShe went to say she had \"loved being the creative director of PLT more than anything\", stressing that there had been \"no drama\" and \"nothing [bad] has gone on\". It was simply that this \"amazing chapter\" of her life had \"naturally come to an end\".\n\n\"I am a mum now and I never really gave myself a maternity leave and I got straight back into work instantly because my work is my phone and showing my life is my work,\" she continued.\n\n\"The last thing I would want to be is in a role that I can't fulfil right this moment.\"\n\nHer departure comes two months after longstanding PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani left the Boohoo Group brand, to pursue new opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, Hague announced she was taking a new direction by accepting a senior job with the label. \"I'm excited to be a creative director - I'm not an influencer any more and people can see that, it's become a lot more than that,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"I'm basically going to eat, sleep, breathe PrettyLittleThing - although I do that anyway\".\n\nIt was a big and controversial signing at the time, with some commentators suggesting it was unfair she had walked from the Love Island villa into a hugely influential fashion job.\n\nHague argued she had worked hard and was passionate about the brand, one she had decided to work with despite having been offered more money to go elsewhere.\n\nShe said she had turned down an offer of \u00a32 million to work with a high street brand, simply because she did not wear their clothes.\n\nAt the time she said she wanted to improve the inclusivity of the brand by creating clothes in sizes 4-30, as well as encouraging people to remove cosmetic fillers, if, like her, they had felt they'd made a mistake.\n\n\"I think for me it was a journey of accepting that you don't need to get all these things done to your face, you're fine the way you are,\" she said.\n\nHague was also criticised for her involvement with the company after PrettyLittleThing owner BooHoo was accused of paying garment workers in Leicester only \u00a33.50 per hour following a 2020 investigation by The Sunday Times.\n\nThe following year, BooHoo said: \"We recognise the risks of poor labour practices, human rights abuses and modern slavery in complex global supply chains and we are committed to establishing robust due diligence programmes and collaborating with others from the industry, authorities and NGOs to tackle poor practices and protect those people who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nLast year, Hague had an Instagram post banned after she failed to include any mention of it being an advert.\n\nIt was the third time she had been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\n\nShe posted a picture of her wearing a PrettyLittleThing dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.\n\nThe ASA said it was not \"immediately clear\" that she had a commercial interest in PLT. The brand confirmed their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the \"\u00a3ad\" disclosure in posts.\n\nBridlington Coastguard Rescue Team says technicians carried the \"very friendly\" dog back up the cliff using a rescue bag\n\nThe owners of a dog which fell 160ft (49m) down a cliff on the East Yorkshire coast say it's a \"miracle\" she's still alive.\n\nSandra Costin was walking Button the Cockapoo in Flamborough on Thursday morning when she disappeared through a gate.\n\nAfter birdwatchers spotted her running about in the cove below, a coastguard team abseiled down and rescued her.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, we can't really believe it,\" her owner said.\n\nMrs Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, was on holiday with husband Brian and walking Button off the lead through fields near Thornwick Bay Holiday Park at the time.\n\n\"I turned my eyes away from her for a second and it was done, as easy as that,\" Mrs Costin said.\n\n\"People started to help us, a man with binoculars looked over the edge and said, 'I can see a dog'.\"\n\nThe coastguard was contacted on 999, with the what3words app used to give rescuers the cliff's location.\n\nButton required a back operation after the fall but is now recovering at home\n\nMrs Costin said: \"We could see her walking around and that was such a miraculous thing, we thought she'd obviously be dead at the bottom of the cliff.\n\n\"We still don't know how she escaped because it's so far down, it's a miracle.\"\n\nPraising the team who rescued the dog, Brian Costin said: \"Everything was so organised, they abseiled down and they were there in about a minute.\n\n\"She got out of the [rescue] bag and I really couldn't believe she was alive.\"\n\nButton's owners said the dog required an operation on her back on Tuesday and was recovering at home.\n\nOwners Sandra and Brian Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, praised both the coastguard and vets for their actions\n\nMrs Costin added: \"I'll never get over not having her on a lead, but when we're in fields she likes to run around and she always comes back if you shout her.\"\n\nBridlington Coastguard Rescue Team said two technicians descended the cliff and were \"met by a very friendly dog\".\n\n\"This is an important reminder that when walking dogs on cliff top paths, ensure they are kept on a lead,\" a coastguard spokesperson said.\n\n\"Never put yourself in danger, dial 999 and ask for the coastguard.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

She says she felt so much shame and believed she was in the wrong, so wanted to protect him.\n\nAt the age of five, just before going on a trip to Legoland, she tried to tell her mother about the abuse.\n\nA photo taken that day shows a little girl with long blonde plaits smiling up at her parents. If it is hard for Poppy to find the right words now, this is a reminder of how impossible it must have been at such a young age.\n\nPoppy tried to tell her parents what was happening when she was five\n\n\"She started to tell us, then giggled,\" says Miranda. \"We just didn't really realise what she was trying to tell us.\"\n\nHer parents thought she had seen John when he had come out of the shower. David spoke to his father.\n\n\"His immediate response was - 'I might have got changed in front of her,'\" says David. His father promised it wouldn't happen again.\n\n\"He literally shut it down completely, but in a calm way. And I thought, OK! He is my dad!\"\n\nThe abuse stopped, but as Poppy grew, so did her anxiety. She describes the guilt she felt as \"eating her alive\".\n\nA teenager's story of survival and making a difference. By talking openly about the sexual abuse that devastated her early life, Poppy is determined to challenge the taboos that make it difficult for survivors to ask for and get help.\n\nAt school, aged 10 and 11, Poppy was having lessons warning about sexual exploitation and grooming. She began to recognise what had happened to her.\n\n\"I'm sat there thinking, 'I'm involved in that',\" Poppy says. \"That's me, that's dark. That's disgusting.\"\n\nThe CSA Centre says an estimated one child in every 10 will have their life damaged by some form of sexual abuse by the age of 16.\n\nThen came a day when Poppy was being physically sick. Her mother suggested they go for a walk. It was then Poppy took the leap and told her about the abuse.\n\n\"I just needed to keep her safe,\" says Poppy's mother Miranda\n\n\"It was sickening,\" says Miranda. \"She obviously saw the look on my face, and was like, 'Mum, please don't tell anybody. I don't want anything to happen to him. I love him.' She immediately said, 'It's my fault. I'm not a nice person.'\"\n\nMiranda says she was \"clueless\" as to what to do next. \"I'd never even come across anyone that had been through this. I just needed to keep her safe.\"\n\nPoppy had been worried about her mum's reaction, but says it was an immediate \"we are going to get through this\". The relief she felt was huge, because \"it was now in other people's hands\".\n\nThey headed home, and as Miranda puts it: \"Cried a lot, then it was, how do I tell David?\"\n\nShe phoned her husband - as he was working away.\n\nHe describes his \"huge mixed emotions\" when he heard the news.\n\n\"I had to make this call to ultimately report my father,\" he says. \"It was incredibly tough. However, she's my daughter, and she comes first.\"\n\nThe grandfather never admitted what he had done - says child protection officer Det Con Deniz Aslan\n\nPoppy was then interviewed by Det Con Deniz Aslan, from Kent Police's child protection team, along with a social worker.\n\nDet Con Aslan remembers the 11-year-old being very anxious. This was the first time she had explained to anyone exactly what her grandfather had done.\n\n\"Any sexual abuse of a child is serious,\" DC Aslan says. \"But the rape of an under 13-year-old, I don't think you get more serious than that.\"\n\nShe says the grandfather never admitted what he had done.\n\nMiranda's voice breaks as she describes being told by the police the details of what had happened.\n\n\"She was being raped by him. And she felt responsible for it. No child should feel responsible for that,\" she says.\n\n\"Poppy would never give us the full detail of what he'd done. She was trying to protect us.\"\n\nFor David, there was the distress of knowing his father was the abuser.\n\n\"He was abusing our daughter, and then five minutes later, he was having a cup of tea with us. So I felt, who is this man?\n\n\"But then equally, as a child, I had many happy memories. There was a real conflict going on in my mind.\"\n\nPoppy's parents sold their business and moved house to keep her safe\n\nIt took 18 months for the case against the grandfather, John, to reach trial.\n\nAcross England and Wales, only 12% of reported offences result in charges - according to the CSA Centre - and it typically takes nearly two years for those to get to court.\n\nPoppy's recorded interview was played, then she was cross-examined. She had just turned 13.\n\n\"I was so desperate to fight my own corner,\" she says. \"In some ways, there was a good amount of anger behind me, so telling my side of the story was incredibly important.\"\n\nIn 2018, John was found guilty on three counts, including rape, and was jailed for 13-and-a-half years.\n\nThe judge described Poppy's testimony as \"heart-rending\" and \"utterly compelling\". John's defence that she had made it up at her parents' instigation was described as \"quite absurd\".\n\nHe died in prison last year.\n\nThe conviction was important for Poppy, but so was the counselling she received. She had to wait five months for that support - now, it can take much longer. At Family Matters in Kent, where Poppy went, they have more than 300 abuse survivors waiting.\n\n\"When you want help, you want help now,\" says the charity's chief executive, Mary Trevillion - whose team spends a lot of time risk assessing people while they wait for a counsellor.\n\nShe also finds many people hide what has happened to them, only asking for help when they are adults.\n\nThe Home Office told us it was significantly increasing support for victims of child sexual abuse - including quadrupling money for victims' services by 2024-25.\n\nIt also said it recognised that child sexual abuse was an \"often-hidden\" crime, and that was why the government was making it \"mandatory for those who work with young people to report any suspicions that a child is being sexually abused or exploited\".\n\nThe small plane climbs high into the cloudless sky.\n\nPoppy is doing the skydive to raise money for a helpline that supports abuse survivors while they wait to see a counsellor. So far, she has raised more than \u00a370,000.\n\nPoppy and her instructor shuffle to the edge of the plane's open door - the patchwork fields of Kent spreads out beneath them.\n\nPoppy says her life now is \"incredible\"\n\nMinutes later, Poppy is on the ground - safe and laughing.\n\n\"You've got that initial panic,\" she says, \"but then it's just that relief", "yer were sent off for fighting each other.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Cleaning up the 'cavern of lost souls'\n\nSocial media photo seekers are \"killing\" special places, says a caver after volunteers hauled piles of rubbish out of a 19th Century mine.\n\nAnthony Taylor said a YouTube video of old cars dumped in the Gwynedd quarry had more than six million views, bringing an influx of visitors.\n\nDozens of photos of the \"car grave\" have since appeared on Instagram.\n\nBut those taking the pictures also left behind rubbish and graffiti.\n\n\"They are beautiful places, and a lot of people don't want them to be ruined,\" said Mr Taylor, 42, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion.\n\n\"Instagram seems to be the killer of a lot of things,\" he said. \"People turn up, take a picture and then leave [a mess].\"\n\nGaewern slate mine is on private land near Corris Uchaf. Mining began in 1820, and continued after a merger with nearby Braichgoch slate mine until the 1970s, employing 200 at its peak.\n\nThe \"car grave\" is illuminated by shafts of light at certain times of day\n\nAfter it closed, old cars and televisions were dumped into one of the mine's two main chambers above a lake, creating the unusual scene of a rusting scrap metal heap that gets illuminated by shafts of sunlight at certain times of day.\n\n\"It's a bizarre environment, probably the one of the oddest places in the world,\" he remembered from his first visit in 2022.\n\n\"How often do you see hundreds of cars underground with lights coming onto them from the sun?\"\n\nBut to get there, he first had to pass an entrance littered with discarded bin bags that visitors had used to try to keep their feet dry.\n\nThe cavers removing graffiti and rubbish from Gaewern in March\n\n\"From about 30ft (9m) in, the spray painting starts, and it was awful,\" he said.\n\nThe graffiti gets worse in the main chamber towards the cars, he said, with more rubbish on the floor, including discarded glow sticks and human faeces.\n\n\"When you get to the end, it was just a sea of boats, inflatable dinghies everywhere,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just disgusting, really sad and disheartening.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Preserved boots, lanterns and massive machinery frozen in time are captured in videos and photos\n\n\"The whole reason people want to visit a place like this is because they've seen it on the internet and think, 'That's an amazing place to go and see', so why would you trash it?\"\n\nMr Taylor said he and his fellow cavers hauled as many dinghies out as they could and held a bigger clean-up with six volunteers on 22 March.\n\n\"Something had to be done,\" he said, estimating his group and another from the YouTube channel Hell on Earth removed 30 discarded dinghies in total.\n\n\"The people that go to these places, influencers they call themselves\u2026 they go because they've got inherent value to them. Why destroy it for everyone else?\"\n\nCaver Gareth Jones and the other volunteers alongside the rubbish brought to the surface\n\nHe wants to educate people about the value of old mines, and fears sites like Gaewern could one day be sealed off.\n\n\"If these things keep happening, it's going to be lost to everyone forever.\"\n\nDuring his many trips to abandoned mines around mid Wales he has found a child's footprint, hobnail boots, tools, miners' gloves and a 170-year-old barrow \"still where the miner originally left it\".\n\n\"If you can't see [the value] in that, I don't know.\n\n\"I wouldn't have thought you'd have to teach people these things, but you really do in this day and age.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis week, scientists published evidence that supermassive black holes send shockwaves which distort space and time as they orbit each other.\n\nOne of the groups that made the discovery is the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOgrav) Collaboration, which is chaired by Northern Ireland native Dr Stephen Taylor.\n\nThe 35-year-old credits his love of all things space-related with seeing a partial solar eclipse during the summer of 1999, which also happened to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the first moon landing.\n\n\"The combination of those things and us learning about it at school - it just really sparked my imagination,\" Dr Taylor said.\n\nHe continued his education at Wallace High School in his home town of Lisburn and his passion for science, he says, never left him.\n\n\"I was always fascinated by it and that really played a big role in what subjects I chose for GCSE and A-level,\" he said.\n\nArtist impression: Supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies spiral in on each other, sending gravitational shock waves across the Universe\n\nWhile studying for his A-level's, Dr Taylor went for work experience at a laser laboratory in Oxford.\n\nIt is there that he had a chance encounter with another Northern Ireland scientist whose work played a large role in his later research.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he had the opportunity to attend a talk by Dame Jocelyn Bell-Burnell who discovered pulsars while a grad student at Cambridge.\n\nPulsars are dead stars which rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals.\n\n\"She gave a fantastic talk and I went up afterwards spouting the popular science I had read, thinking I knew everything,\" he said.\n\n\"But she was just really nice and kind of humoured me, if I am honest.\"\n\nPulsars would then be measured by Dr Taylor and his team in this latest paper.\n\n\"I think it's really nice that Northern Irish people are on both ends of this - because I certainly didn't hear accents like mine giving these kind of science interviews or talks,\" he said.\n\nDr Taylor then went on to do his undergraduate degree at Oxford, followed by a PhD at Cambridge looking at gravitational waves.\n\n\"At the time the idea was still theoretical. There were mainstream projects such as Ligo\" - the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory - \"but people were more focused on other aspects of physics.\n\n\"But my philosophy was, if I am going to do this I am going to enjoy it and this was what fascinated me most.\"\n\nThe first in his family to go to university, Dr Taylor said his parents always encouraged him to make choices that made him happy.\n\nFrom there, the \"Nasa-mad\" Dr Taylor had the opportunity to work at the space agency's jet propulsion laboratory before spending some time at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThis led him to begin taking up leadership roles, chairing a working group looking at gravitational waves and getting a permanent position at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHis team have been studying the signals which are emitted by pulsars and the affects of gravitational waves on their frequencies.\n\nDr Taylor described the radio beams from pulsars as being like light beams from a lighthouse. When the frequency at which they hit Earth changes, this shows gravitational waves as predicted by Einstein.\n\nHe said the most plausible cause of these waves is the orbit of supermassive black holes.\n\n\"We've seen loads of hints along the way but this is the first evidence in this kind of data set which is really exciting.\"\n\nDr Taylor said that, due to the frequencies, these black holes would be billions of times as massive as the sun and sit at the centres of galaxies.\n\n\"I never thought I would be involved in something like this. It was fun to be part of the physics and maths problems but I never thought it would get to this point,\" he said.\n\nDr Taylor said that the support of family, friends and his schools played a vital role.\n\n\"They never put up road blocks. I mean, if someone said they wanted to be a theoretical astrophysicist and", "upol said their city had been inundated with labourers from across Russia, as well as from Central Asia.\n\nOleg Morgun, the Russia-installed \"mayor\" of Mariupol, says some 70,000 of those currently in the city are construction workers and members of the Russian military.\n\nNew buildings have appeared and many buildings damaged during the bombardment have gone.\n\nFor example, the Russian military has built a whole new district comprised of a dozen apartment blocks in the western part of Mariupol. It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.\n\nRussia is building new housing to replace what it destroyed\n\n\"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we're part of Russia now,\" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.\n\n\"I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.\"\n\nIn the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.\n\nHeating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.\n\nMany schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.\n\nMaria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: \"It's so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares.\" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.\n\nRussia has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.\n\nShops have reopened and power is back, but many traders are selling their wares on the pavement\n\nThe fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.\n\nThe Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.\n\nThere are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.\n\nFor example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.\n\nIvan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed \"huge queues\" trying to get Russian passports.\n\nThey were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.\n\nAlso, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as \"filtration\", he added.\n\nUkraine believes 20,000 people died during the siege of Mariupol\n\n\"So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.\n\nMariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.\n\nRussia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.\n\nRussian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.\n\nThe media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.\n\nMany current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.\n\n\"We've suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,\" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.\n\nNew signs for the city are decked out in the colours of the Russian flag\n\nThe fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.\n\n\"I'm sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,\" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). \"I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now.\"\n\nCity councillor Ivan said: \"It's become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It's tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.\"\n\nThose who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.\n\nPopular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.\n\n\"If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn't reconstruction. It's not something they can be thanked for,\" he said.\n\n\"You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?\" he said.\n\n\"You can't rebuild them. You can't bring them back.\"\n\nIt is the third critical inspection report in a year for Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E department\n\nA third inspection in a year failed to find any major improvements at a north Wales hospital's emergency department.\n\nStaff at Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E were said to be working tirelessly to give the best care possible, but the service still requires significant improvement.\n\nInspectors said poor sepsis screening and triage and pain relief delays were putting patients at significant risk.\n\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan admitted there were still \"very, very serious problems\" at the department.\n\nInspectors' concerns about standards in the department were classified as the most significant, with minimal improvements since their two previous visits.\n\nThe report comes a month after the health board was placed back in special measures following a damning audit report, and 11 independent board members were told to quit by the Welsh government.\n\nHealthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) visited the emergency department of the hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in November after previous visits in March and May of 2022.\n\nTheir report again highlights an \"incredibly busy department, struggling with shortages of staff, high numbers of seriously unwell patients and a lack of space to treat them\".\n\nThe same could be said of emergency departments across Wales, but the fact that so little has been done to improve things since two previous visits means it remains under HIW's highest level of scrutiny.\n\nSome speciality doctors refused to review patients in the emergency department, inspectors found\n\nHIW chief executive Alun Jones said: \"This inspection found evidence of a department struggling to cope with the day-to-day demand of providing a safe service to patients.\n\n\"It has highlighted areas such as poor team working between the ED [emergency department] and other departments within the hospital which, in turn, is compounding nationally recognised challenges around patient flow.\n\n\"The health board will need to take strong and decisive action to tackle the issues identified in our inspection. We will continue to engage with the health board to ensure sustained action is taken in relation to our findings.\n\n\"Inspectors found the standard of patient notes had improved, however rotas were challenging as there was a heavy reliance on bank and", "of view, it is crucial the price of crude remains over $80 a barrel for it to break even.

Concerns about the global economy, especially recessionary fears in the US and Europe are expected to put further pressure on crude prices.\n\nOil producers are grappling with falling prices and high market volatility amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe West has accused Opec of manipulating prices and undermining the global economy through high energy costs. It has also accused the group of siding with Russia despite sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Opec insiders have said the West's monetary policy over the last decade has driven inflation and forced oil-producing nations to act to maintain the value of their main export.\n\nThe crossing forms part of the Strathspey Railway\n\nSafety barriers have been installed at the last automatic open railway level crossing in Scotland.\n\nDalfaber Level Crossing in Aviemore was built in the early 1980s and is on a private line used by Strathspey Railway's steam locomotives.\n\nIt was an open crossing with warning signs and lights but no barriers before the new improvements were made.\n\nNew footways have also been constructed as part of the \u00a31.1m upgrade to improve safety at the site.\n\nThe crossing has been the scene of collisions and near misses involving cars and trains -

physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.\n\nThere were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern.\n\nTsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.\n\nBut, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.\n\nThat teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.\n\nMurray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.\n\nAfter not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.\n\nHowever, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.\n\nThe sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.\n\nIt had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\nThursday's blast damaged a number of buildings -

There's just too many of these people on social media. Thanks for your support friends,\" he said.\n\nThe corporation said the information would be \"acted upon appropriately\".\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"We treat any allegations very seriously and we have processes in place to proactively deal with them.\n\n\"As part of that, if we receive information that requires further investigation or examination we will take steps to do this. That includes actively attempting to speak to those who have contacted us in order to seek further detail and understanding of the situation.\n\n\"If we get no reply to our attempts or receive no further contact that can limit our ability to progress things but it does not mean our enquiries stop.\n\n\"If, at any point, new information comes to light or is provided - including via newspapers - this will be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes.\"\n\nBBC's culture editor Katie Razzall said many questions remain unanswered, including how the corporation has investigated the family's complaint and if it was appropriate for the presenter, who has not been named, to stay on air after a serious allegation was made.\n\nThe BBC's statement appears to suggest its initial investigation may have been hampered by a lack of response from the family, she said.\n\nThis allegation, if proven, would mean the career of a high-profile BBC presenter is likely to be over.\n\nCCTV shows the moment a ceiling panel came crashing down, nearly hitting a commuter at a subway station in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MBTA) said the panel was installed in the 1980s, and weighed about 11kg (25 lbs) because of moisture build-up.\n\nNo injuries were reported, and the MBTA said it had now removed any other panels from the station that posed an immediate safety concern.

Now there are four, some of them falling on the day of major sport and music events.\n\nAny hopes the RMT's dispute with 14 train companies was close to being solved, have now been dashed. It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

It was edited by Dulcie Lee and myself, Heather Sharp.\n\nIn a way the battle has already been won, as Presdient Emmanuel Macron has got the pension reforms bill through.\n\nBut the protesters say they'll keep going, that there may be other means to get it overturned or they hope they'll bring the government down.\n\nHowever, the law is now going ahead and the government is banking on there being a certain loss of momentum as a result.\n\nIt may also be banking on the fact that if the movement radicalises, which it may well do now - as more hardline elements take over and there are outbursts of violence on the streets - then many people will turn away and say it's no longer their fight.\n\nThat's what happened with the yellow vests - the gilets jaune - around four years ago.\n\nBut we've no way really of knowing what's going to happen", "of Alberta, Canada withdrew its support for a bid.\n\nThe rate of price rises at UK supermarkets hit a new high in the year to May due to coffee, chocolate and non-food goods.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) and NielsenIQ said that the overall rate of inflation at grocers reached 9%.\n\nWhile prices for fresh food have fallen marginally, the cost of commodities such as coffee and cocoa has jumped.\n\nThe government is in talks about asking supermarkets to cap prices on food items to help with the cost of living.\n\nAn agreement, which would be voluntary, would limit the cost of basic foods such as bread and milk.\n\nBut the BRC has dismissed caps, stating the government should focus on cutting red tape so resources could be \"directed to keeping prices as low as possible\", as opposed to \"recreating 1970s-style price controls\".\n\nOn Monday, Sainsbury's cut the cost of more than 40 of its own-brand products including cheese, yoghurt and cream.\n\n\"Whenever we are paying less for the products we buy from our suppliers, we will pass those savings on to customers,\" said Rhian Bartlett, its food commercial director.\n\nThe BRC and NielsenIQ figures, covering the week between 1 and 6 May, show that overall food inflation ticked lower from 15.7% in the year to April to 15.4%.\n\nDespite the fall, the figure is the second highest rate of food inflation on record.\n\nA decline in the rate of price rises does not mean food costs have fallen, it simply means they are going up at a slower pace.\n\nMeanwhile, the pace of price rises for non-food goods grew from 5.5% in the year to April to 5.8% in May.\n\nThis is despite supermarkets making \"heavy discounts\" on goods such as footwear, books and home entertainment, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC.\n\nFresh produce showed a slowdown in price rises, from 17.8% to 17.2% in May.\n\nIn April, supermarkets cut the price of milk by 5p, taking cost of a pint to 90p. However, that is still almost double pre-Covid prices in March 2020.\n\nPrice growth for ambient foods - which are goods that can be stored at room temperature - rose in the year to May from 12.9% to 13.1%. It is the fastest increase on ambient foods prices on record, said the BRC and NielsenIQ.\n\nMs Dickinson said: \"The price of chocolate and coffee rose off the back of the ongoing high global costs for these commodities.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed that the overall headline rate of inflation had fallen sharply to 8.7% in April - the first time it fell under 10% since August.\n\nHowever, the drop was less than economists and investors had expected after grocery price rises remained close to the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nIt is also still more than four times the Bank of England's 2% target rate of inflation. The Bank has lifted interest rates 12 times in a row to 4.5% in an attempt to calm price rises.\n\nBut following the higher-than-expected figure for April, some analysts speculated that interest rates could reach 5.5% by the end of the year.\n\nFood production costs have risen due to a number of factors including the cost of energy which rose following the end of Covid lockdowns, which pushed up demand, as well as Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\nRussia, which is a major oil and gas producer, was hit with sanctions.\n\nUkraine - known as the breadbasket of Europe - is one of the biggest exporters of grain in the world and has seen shipments severely disrupted because of the war.\n\nAdverse weather conditions in some parts of Europe and Africa also impacted some fresh vegetables earlier this year, leading to supermarkets introducing customer limits on sales of peppers, tomatoes and cucumber.\n\nWholesale gas prices have started to drop but retailers claim that falling production costs take time to filter through to supermarket shelves due to the long-term contracts they typically sign with food producers.\n\nMike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said: \"Food retailing in particular is competitive, so hopefully the recent price cuts in fresh foods is a sign that inflation has now peaked, albeit ambient inflation may take a little while longer to slow.\"\n\nMichael Donnelly, pictured in Belfast on Tuesday, said the police apology was 50 years too late\n\nOne of the \"Hooded Men\", Michael Donnelly, has said he does not accept a police apology over his treatment.\n\nMr Donnelly was one of 14 men arrested in 1971 during internment without trial and questioned by the police and Army.\n\nTwo years ago the Supreme Court ruled that the techniques they were subjected to would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) made a formal apology to the surviving Hooded Men on Tuesday.\n\nThe public apology came a day after the death of one of the men, Joe Clarke, at the age of 71.\n\nThe apology had been hand delivered to Mr Clarke by his solicitor on Thursday, four days before he died.\n\nMr Donnelly, who is from Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today programme that the apology is \"50 years too late\" for him and he said that it personally feels \"fairly meaningless\".\n\n\"I do not accept it - not at all,\" Mr Donnelly said.\n\nDuring their detention, the Hooded Men said they were forced to listen to constant loud static noise; deprived of sleep, food and water; forced to stand in stress positions; and beaten if they fell.\n\nThe men also said they were hooded and thrown from helicopters a short distance off the ground, having been told they were hundreds of feet in the air.\n\nPSNI Det Ch Supt Ian Saunders said the police had issued the apology for the \"actions and omissions of police officers involved in their treatment whilst in police custody in 1971\".\n\n\"The police service recognises the significant step taken today in issuing this apology,\" he said.\n\n\"It is our view this was the right thing to do to help give the Hooded Men and their families recognition about how they were treated,\" he added.\n\nSome of the Hooded Men and families gathered after the announcement was made\n\nMr Donnelly described the ordeal of being placed into a helicopter with his hands tied behind his back and being told that he was going to be pushed out from a great height over a body of water.\n\nHe also described at one stage thinking he was going to die during his detention after being severely beaten by his captors.\n\n\"I was trying to survive literally by the second, you could barely breathe at times when you were wearing the hood,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes I thought I was going to survive and then other times I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nMr Donnelly said he does not see why he should forgive anyone for his treatment.\n\nThe Hooded Men case has been the subject of multiple legal actions in the UK and Europe for decades.\n\nIn 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques used on the men amounted to torture.\n\nThis ruling was later referred to by the European Court of Human Rights in 1978, which held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment, but fell short of defining it as torture.\n\nIn 2019, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, Northern Ireland's most senior judge, said their treatment \"would, if it occurred today, properly be characterised as torture\".\n\nIn 2021, the Supreme Court issued their ruling that the men's treatment would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK government said it acknowledged \"the pain and suffering felt by so many during the Troubles\".\n\n\"There are several ongoing legal proceedings in relation to this incident, and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nA criminal investigation has been launched into the death of an elderly woman who was struck by police escorting the Duchess of", "show he's back in control.\n\nHe even has time to doodle. He must be feeling confident.\n\nFollowing the mutiny, we've witnessed a turbo-charged Putin this week. He was here, he was there, he seemed to be everywhere. It was almost as if he'd kicked off his campaign for re-election (his presidential term expires next year).\n\nBut positive pictures do not change the fact that the rebellion had taken the Kremlin by surprise. It was a threat. The Wagner fighters had been well on their way to Moscow when the mutiny was called off. It was an unprecedented challenge to Putin's authority.\n\nAnd the long-term consequences of that are still unclear.\n\nBritish Transport Police said the alleged assault happened on a train from Aberdare to Cardiff Central\n\nA man was sexually assaulted on a train after lewd comments were made towards him, police say.\n\nThe incident happened at about 12:50 BST on 1 July, on a train from Aberdare to Cardiff Central.\n\nThe victim walked past a group of people before a man allegedly \"made lewd comments towards him\".\n\nPolice said the man then sexually assaulted the victim before \"making light of the incident\".\n\nA 40-year-old man was later arrested in connection with the assault before being released on bail.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPausing Ofsted inspections would be the \"empathetic, human, correct thing to do\", says the sister of a head teacher who took her own life after an inspection - as the watchdog announces some changes to how it works.\n\nRuth Perry died while waiting for a report that downgraded her school.\n\nHer sister, Prof Julia Waters, wants a full review to take place.\n\nOfsted is making some changes, such as how it manages complaints - but will keep its one-word grading system.\n\nChief inspector Amanda Spielman said the schools watchdog for England, \"will continue to listen\" to try to make improvements.\n\nOfsted has said its thoughts are with Ms Perry's family, and described her death as a tragedy.\n\nThe family believes the anxiety and stress following the inspection led to Ms Perry's suicide.\n\n\"She was fine beforehand, she was not fine during and after it. It is a potentially dangerous system,\" Prof Waters told BBC News.\n\nShe added that they had not heard directly from Ofsted about the concerns the family has raised.\n\n\"It adds to the hurt, it adds to the outrage, it adds to our feeling of injustice about what happened to Ruth,\" she said.\n\nProf Waters said she had been overwhelmed by the number of people getting in touch and speaking out about their concerns with the inspection process after Ms Perry's death.\"It confirms our worst fears, that this is something that has been going on for a long time,\" she said.\n\nShe wants inspections to be paused so that an independent inquiry into what happened at Ms Perry's school, in Reading, can take place - as well as a review of the culture of inspections at Ofsted.\n\nRuth Perry, who took her own life in January, had been waiting for an Ofsted report rating her school as \"inadequate\"\n\nIn a statement, Ms Spielman outlined the changes Ofsted are making which include:\n\n\"We are not deaf to the calls for change, or insensitive to the needs of schools and their staff,\" Ms Spielman added.\n\nProf Waters said this latest response was \"totally insensitive to the situation\" and was far from \"anything like a meaningful response to the growing calls for reform\".\n\nCaversham Primary School was downgraded by Ofsted after inspectors decided that checks on staff and record-keeping of concerns about children were inadequate.\n\nUnder the current system, this means the leadership of the school is declared inadequate, as well as the school overall.\n\nThe quality of education and behaviour at the school were praised by inspectors.\n\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, most schools were inspected roughly once every four years. However all visits were put on hold in the pandemic.\n\nOutstanding schools were also exempt for eight years up to 2020, which means some are now now facing inspection for the first time in a decade.\n\nSome academy school leaders have said Ofsted is not fully considering the impact of the pandemic.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said standards on keeping children safe would not be \"watered down\", and she continued to support a \"clear one-word rating\" to inform parents' decisions.\n\nShe told MPs earlier this week she would be willing to meet Ms Perry's family.\n\nOfsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, inspects and reports on anywhere that provides education for young people in England - including schools, nurseries and childminders.\n\nSchools or organisations are inspected every four years or 30 months depending on their status, and are then graded accordingly:\n\nMany parents rely on Ofsted ratings to help them choose a school or nursery for their child.\n\nFollowing Ruth Perry's death, some school leaders and teaching unions called for a review of the impact of inspections and the current system of one-word grades.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Jon Coles, the Chief Executive of United Learning, which runs 72 state academy schools across England, and a former education civil servant who led the improvement of London's schools, said Ofsted is a positive thing and does contribute to public understanding of schools.\n\nHe said inspectors produce a four-page report at the end of a full inspection: \"The overall single-word grade and then the four single-word judgments are accompanied by quite a lot of detail and explanation.\"\n\nJulie McCulloch, from the Association of School & College Leaders (ASCL), said while some of proposals put forward by Ofsted are helpful, they are concerned that Ofsted \"aren't prepared to look at the single-word judgements\".\n\nShe agrees there is a longer report but \"people tend to concentrate on that grade rather than on the nuances behind it, and when we talk to our members, they say the biggest cause of stress around inspection is that reductive approach that tends to capture most of what a school does in a single word or phrase\".\n\nIn March, the National Education Union (NEU), school leaders' union NAHT, and the ASCL called for inspections to be halted.\n\nThe recruitment process for a new chief inspector of Ofsted is already under way, because Ms Spielman is standing down later this year.\n\nProf Waters says change can't wait until then: \"There is an urgent problem in Ofsted, and it needs to be dealt with urgently. What happened to Ruth could happen again.\"\n\nA full inquest will consider the circumstances around Ruth Perry's suicide later this year.\n\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article you can visit the BBC Action Line pages, or contact or Samaritans.\n\nThe story of head teacher, Ruth Perry, who took her life after her school's rating was downgraded by Ofsted.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I told him this.\"\n\nEidevall said he did not feel \"comfortable with the label\".\n\nThe Swede said the situation with Cuthbert arose because the teams had disagreed about whether there should be a multi-ball system when the ball went out.\n\nEidevall was booked for his goal celebration but Hayes later said she believed he should have been dismissed for his conduct.\n\nLucy Letby, 33, is accused of murdering babies on a neonatal ward\n\nOne of nurse Lucy Letby's \"favourite ways of killing and trying to kill children\" on a hospital neonatal unit was by injecting air, a prosecutor has told her trial.\n\nMs Letby is alleged to have murdered seven babies and attempted to murder 10 others between June 2015 and June 2016.\n\nProsecutor Nick Johnson KC said experts for the prosecution had told Manchester Crown Court at least 12 of those received an air injection.\n\nOn the third day of his closing speech, Mr Johnson told jurors not to ignore the \"constellation of coincidences\" in baby deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nHe said they should \"put all the pieces of the jigsaw together\" and suggested the \"cumulative picture\" told only one story, that Ms Letby \"tried to murder or murdered these children\".\n\nMr Johnson cited the case of Child C, who stopped breathing without warning on 13 June 2015 while being treated in the unit's nursery one.\n\nHe said the collapse and death was \"inconsistent\" with all natural causes, as asserted by the medical experts in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor noted the nurse was seen in nursery one at the time of Child C's collapse, despite being allocated a baby in nursery three.\n\nHe said she was there \"with death on her mind\".\n\nMr Johnson went on to remind the jury of Sophie Ellis' evidence, who was Child C's designated nurse that day.\n\nMs Ellis told the jury how she had briefly left Child C and when she returned to the nursery, Ms Letby was standing over him.\n\nShe said the nurse told her: \"He's just had a brady/desat\".\n\nThe alleged attacks were said to have been carried out at Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nMr Johnson also said nurse Melanie Taylor had recalled being surprised at how \"cool and calm\" Ms Letby appeared as medics rushed to help the baby.\n\nHe alleged that swelling noted by a doctor in Child C's vocal cords indicated that \"something had been put down his throat\".\n\nThis was also a feature in the cases of Child E, Child G, Child H and Child N, he said.\n\nMr Johnson went on to state that another clue the jurors should consider in Child C's case was the \"massive ballooning\" to his stomach.\n\n\"It's as plain as the nose on your face that Lucy Letby must have injected air down the nasogastric tube,\" he said.\n\n\"It was, after all, one of her favourite ways of killing or trying to kill children in this case.\n\n\"There are a constellation of coincidences which can make you sure that [Child C] didn't die of natural causes and that Lucy Letby killed him.\"\n\nThe nurse, originally from Hereford, has denied all of the charges against her\n\nMr Johnson also noted how Ms Letby's defence counsel, Ben Myers KC, had repeatedly questioned witnesses about the competence of Ms Ellis, who Ms Letby had called the \"new girl\" in messages to colleagues.\n\nThe prosecutor said it was insinuated Ms Ellis was not qualified to be looking after Child C.\n\n\"It's trying to create in the impression in your minds that something was seriously wrong with the hospital,\" he said, adding: \"It's gaslighting you, doing to you what Lucy Letby did to her colleagues.\"\n\nMr Johnson later turned to the evidence heard about Child G, who was transferred to the Countess of Chester Hospital from Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital in mid-August 2015.\n\nThe court has heard she was \"clinically stable\" until 7 September, when she projectile vomited at about 02:00 BST.\n\nThe prosecution case has been that Ms Letby overfed Child G with milk through a nasogastric tube or injected air into the same tube and made two more attempts to kill her on 21 September.\n\nMr Johnson pointed the jury to what Dr Alison Ventress said about Child G.\n\nThe medic told the jury she saw blood-stained secretions coming from the vocal cords in the early hours of 7 September 2015.\n\n\"What caused the throat of an otherwise well baby to bleed?\" Mr Johnson asked.\n\n\"It is a signature of many of her attacks on these babies.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March)\n\nPiers Morgan says he is not aware of phone hacking taking place while he was editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nA High Court case against its owners, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), brought by Prince Harry and several other high-profile figures, began on Wednesday.\n\nLawyers argue that executives at the publisher knew about widespread phone hacking, but failed to act.\n\nSpeaking before the trial, Mr Morgan said: \"I've never hacked a phone. I've never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nThe long-awaited case involves allegations that the publisher of the Mirror illegally gathered information about the Duke of Sussex and a number of other celebrities to generate stories.\n\nIn written arguments put before the court, the barrister representing Prince Harry said it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Morgan and other editors did not know about MGN journalists instructing private investigators to obtain information.\n\nMr Morgan has always denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror when he was editor.\n\nHe was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004\n\nHe was interviewed by the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began. In it, Mr Morgan said he thought phone hacking - the interception of mobile phone voicemail messages - was completely wrong.\n\nHe added it \"shouldn't have been happening\" and said it was \"lazy journalists being lazy\". He said there was no evidence that he knew anything about it.\n\nAsked in the interview whether it stretched credulity that, as a hands-on editor, he didn't know what was going on, Mr Morgan replied: \"I didn't. So I don't care whether it stretches people's credulity, or not.\"\n\nThe former editor pointed out that although there were civil cases happening, none of the journalists who worked with him at the Daily Mirror have been arrested in connection with phone hacking.\n\nMr Morgan worked at the Daily Mirror for nearly a decade, but he said none of the civil cases had anything to do with him.\n\n\"I've not been called to give evidence, I know nothing about it,\" he told BBC News. Asked if he was worried about Prince Harry's legal action, he said he \"couldn't give a monkey's cuss\".\n\n\"I don't give a damn what actions he wants to take,\" he said.\n\nPiers Morgan told Amol Rajan he wasn't aware of any phone hacking while he was at the Daily Mirror\n\nIn 2015, MGN, which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, paid out \u00a31.2m in damages to eight phone hacking victims who refused to settle out of court, including Paul Gascoigne and the actor Sadie Frost.\n\nOther cases have been settled out of court so damages to individuals remain unknown.\n\nOn Wednesday, MGN apologised to Prince Harry for one instance of unlawful information gathering in relation to a story which appeared in the Sunday People in 2004, but it denied allegations of voicemail interception in all the cases being examined.\n\nMr Morgan pointed out he only worked for the Daily Mirror and had no responsibility for the Sunday Mirror or Sunday People, or other titles.\n\nA MGN spokesman said: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.\n\n\"MGN is now part of a very different company. We are committed to acting with integrity and our objective in this trial is to allow both the business and our journalists to move forward from events that took place many years ago.\"\n\nMr Morgan presents a show on TalkTV following his controversial exit from ITV's Good Morning Britain.

Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nStockton Rush was the chief executive of OceanGate, the firm which runs the Titanic voyages, and the company confirmed he was on board.\n\nHe was an experienced engineer who had previously designed an experimental aircraft and worked on other small submersible vessels.\n\nMr Rush founded the company in 2009, offering customers a chance to experience deep sea travel, and made global headlines in 2021 when it began offering trips to the site of the Titanic wreck.\n\nFor $250,000 (\u00a3195,600), his company offers passengers the opportunity to get an up-close glimpse of what remains of the famous ship.\n\nParticipants travel some 370 miles (595km) on a larger ship to the area above the wreck site, then do an eight-hour dive to the Titanic on a truck-sized submersible known as Titan.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in 2022, he defended the business model, and said the ticket price was a \"fraction of the cost of going to space and it's very expensive for us to get these ships and go out there\".\n\nA 2017 feature written for the website of Princeton University, where he studied, reported that Mr Rush goes on every OceanGate dive.\n\nMr Rush was married to Wendy Rush, who is the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, who died in the Titanic wreck after letting women and children escape before them.\n\nMike Reiss, a writer and producer of The Simpsons, went on a Titanic dive in a different OceanGate submersible with Mr Rush.

Following her mother's death, Camilla tried to help raise awareness of the condition with several visits to bone units in hospitals across the UK.\n\nA ceremony taking place at Westminster Abbey in London on 6 May 2023 will see King Charles III crowned alongside Camilla.\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England has said it is \"crucial that we see the job through\" to slow soaring prices in a speech to the world of finance.\n\nAndrew Bailey said reducing inflation to 2% is \"so important\" as people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".\n\nCurrently, inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, is 8.7% - more than four times the Bank's target of 2%.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said government would work to cut inflation.\n\n\"We will do what is necessary for as long as necessary to tackle inflation persistence and bring it back to the 2% target,\" Mr Hunt said at the start of his first Mansion House speech as chancellor.\n\nAbout 400 people from the financial and business industries attended the dinner at the 18th Century building, which is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nIt comes at a time when businesses, as well as households, are being hit by higher costs due to inflation remaining stubbornly high in the UK.\n\nMr Hunt suggested companies should show restraint on profit margins, adding \"margin recovery benefits no-one if it feeds inflation\".\n\nThe Bank of England has steadily been increasing interest rates in a bid to combat inflation.\n\nIts base rate - which has a direct effect on borrowing costs for things like mortgages and credit cards, but also influences savings rates - is now 5%, up from close to zero 18 months ago. Some analysts have predicted interest rates will peak at 6.5%, but some have said they may rise to as high as 7%.\n\nThe theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, and more worthwhile for people to save, people will spend less, which will in turn lead to price rises to slow.\n\nMr Bailey said in his speech to executives at the same Mansion House event \"it is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive\".\n\nHe added that while the UK economy has failed to grow beyond its pre-pandemic level, there had been \"unexpected resilience\" in the face of external shocks, such as Covid and the war in Ukraine, with low levels of unemployment and avoiding a recession to date.\n\nBut the Bank of England's boss highlighted that \"tightness\" in the labour market, with many businesses struggling to find enough workers, has contributed to price inflation being \"more sticky than previously expected\".\n\n\"Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target,\" he added.\n\nThe Bank of England has previously warned big pay rises are contributing to the UK's still-high rates of inflation, but there have also been accusations that some sectors have been profiteering by overcharging customers.\n\nLast week, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed supermarkets had sought to increase profits from selling fuel, increasing their margins by 6p per litre on average between 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe chancellor said \"delivering sound money is our number one focus\", before he delivered his speech focusing on plans for pension fund reforms.\n\nMr Hunt pledged the plans could provide a \u00a31,000-a-year pensions boost to the typical earner who starts saving at 18.\n\nWhile UK pension pots are the largest in Europe, worth \u00a32.5trn, defined contribution schemes currently invest 1% in unlisted equity, limiting returns for savers and funding for businesses, the Treasury has claimed.\n\nThe chancellor revealed an agreement with leading pensions firms to put 5% of their investments into early-stage businesses in the fintech, life sciences, biotech and clean technology sectors by 2030.\n\nThe so-called \"Mansion House Compact\" has been backed by Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal & General, Aegon, Phoenix, NEST, Mercer, M&G and Smart Pension.\n\nAhead of the event, Mansion House organisers said talks had taken place about security at the venue over concerns of protests. A source told the BBC the event was not disrupted.\n\nOn the night a dozen of Donald Trump's Republican rivals spoke at the same event in Iowa, only one challenged the former president head on - and he was roundly booed. It highlights the grip Mr Trump still has on his party.\n\nSomeone backstage at the Lincoln Dinner clearly had a mischievous sense of humour.\n\nAs each of the candidates hoping to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee for 2024 walked out to speak they were accompanied by a blast of music: a clip of the country song Only In America.\n\nWhen it was Mr Trump's turn, two lyrics, describing two alternative paths that could await someone in the US, seemed particularly poignant:\n\nOne could end up going to prison\n\nOne just might be president\n\nThe 45th President of the United States didn't seem to mind. He doesn't try to hide from the fact that he is already facing two criminal trials and may soon be indicted in two more cases. In fact, he wears these charges as a badge of pride.\n\nMr Trump insists he is being unfairly targeted for purely political reasons.\n\nHe told the crowd of 1,200 Republican supporters at this dinner in Iowa - a key state because it will hold the first election in the race for the nomination next January", "ation shows signs of how far Anglo-Irish relations have come.\n\nProf Coleman said the attendance of the President of Ireland is significant.\n\n\"The Irish Free State when it was still a dominion refused to go in 1937. The Republic of Ireland was not represented in 1953 so it's quite an important departure for the Republic of Ireland also.\"\n\nEven more significant is the presence of Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill - who has accepted an invitation to attend the coronation.\n\n\"It's even an advance on Sinn F\u00e9in's position last September, at the time of the death of the Queen, where they drew a distinction between attending events which marked the passing of the Queen, and not attending events which mark the accession of the new King,\" said Prof Coleman.\n\n\"So it looks like their position has even developed from that,\" she added.\n\nHowever, the academic said that much of the progress made in Anglo-Irish relations has been affected by Brexit.\n\nBrexit - the UK's departure from the EU - saw it leave a union once shared with Ireland.\n\nIt also raised questions of sovereignty, identity and borders.\n\nHas the drawn-out departure and protracted negotiations over the Irish border and trade put extra strain on relations between the two governments?\n\nProf Coleman said the process had \"damaged those good relations which the Queen had done so much to forge particularly during that visit in 2011\".\n\nRonan Kanda was mistaken by his murderers for his friend\n\nTwo 17-year-olds have been sentenced for stabbing a 16-year-old boy to death in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nRonan Kanda was murdered close to his home in Wolverhampton after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022.\n\nA trial heard his attackers, one of whom had just collected knives bought online, mistook him for his friend.\n\nPrabjeet Veadhesa will serve a minimum term of 18 years and Sukhman Shergill a minimum of 16, the court heard.\n\nBefore passing sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court, the judge, Mr Justice Choudhury, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the teenagers.\n\nHe made the decision in part to send out a strong message about the seriousness of knife crime, he said.\n\nRonan's mother, Pooja Kanda, said she had lost a lifetime of dreams and ambitions\n\nThe court was told Veadhesa was owed money by Ronan's friend and intended to confront him on 29 June 2022.\n\nThe judge said it was a \"tragic coincidence\" they saw Ronan leave the house where their intended victim lived and assumed he was the boy they were looking for.\n\nHe was just yards away from his family home, but was attacked from behind as he listened to music on headphones.\n\nEarlier in the day, Veadhesa had collected a ninja sword set and a large machete from a local post office after buying them online using a fake name.\n\nThe court heard Shergill carried the machete but Ronan was stabbed twice with the sword by Veadhesa and died at the scene.\n\nHe suffered a 20cm-deep wound in his back and hip area, and a 17cm-deep wound in his chest.\n\nThe pair fled after they realised they had attacked the wrong person, dumping their weapons and clothes.\n\nRonan's parents and sister as well as other supporters wore \"Justice for Ronan\" T-shirts at Wolverhampton Crown Court\n\nMany of Ronan's family, who were in the courtroom wearing \"Justice for Ronan\" T-shirts, sobbed as tributes were read during the hearing.\n\nRonan's mother, Pooja Kanda, read out a personal statement and said she replayed the last time she saw her son alive in her mind every day.\n\n\"I have lost a lifetime of dreams, hopes and ambitions,\" she said. \"He was the son that every mother needs.\"\n\nAddressing the defendants, who both looked at the floor as she spoke, she told them \"your evil actions have taken my son's life\" which left her with \"nothing but hatred for this world\".\n\nHis father, Chander Kanda, said the death of his son had destroyed his life.\n\nRonan's sister, Nikita Kanda, said she was \"no longer the same person\" and added \"my world has stopped, I feel empty and I'm just surviving\".\n\nAlthough Shergill, from Willenhall, did not inflict any blows, a jury found he acted in the joint enterprise of his murder and convicted both teenagers after a five-week trial.\n\nIn defence of Veadhesa, from Walsall, Adam Morgan said his client was of good character and was \"genuinely remorseful\".\n\nTimothy Hannam KC, defending Shergill, said his client should be treated more leniently as \"Veadhesa was the one who actually killed Ronan\".\n\nWest Midlands Police described it as an \"unbelievably callous and shocking case of mistaken identity\".\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

US officials said he had agreed to a visit to Washington at the talks.\n\nMr Qin said Taiwan was the \"most prominent risk\" for China-US relations and described the Taiwan issue as one of \"China's core interests\", state media said.\n\nChina sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control, but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland with its own constitution and leaders. US President Joe Biden said last year that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, a move condemned by Beijing.\n\nMr Qin greeted Mr Blinken on Sunday morning at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, a lavish estate that typically hosts visiting dignitaries.\n\nThe two shook hands as they stood before their respective flags, then sat down with their delegations at long tables to begin their meetings.\n\nThe greeting was business-like, underscoring the chilly relations that have developed between the two superpowers in recent years.\n\nThe US had been lowering expectations for the trip and both sides have made clear they do not expect any major breakthrough.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, trade disputes over advanced computer technologies, the fentanyl drug epidemic in the US and Chinese human rights conduct are all topics the Americans were expecting to be discussed.\n\nChinese officials have reacted coolly to Mr Blinken's visit, questioning whether the US is sincere in its efforts to mend relations.\n\nIt is not clear whether he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nMr Blinken is the highest-ranking US government official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.\n\n\"If we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn't veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating,\" Mr Blinken told reporters on Friday.\n\nLater he said he hoped to meet President Xi in the next few months.\n\nA meeting between President Biden and Xi Jinping in Bali in November briefly eased fears of a new Cold War, but since the balloon incident high-level communication between the two leaders has been rare.\n\nAfter health inspectors considered closing a maternity unit over safety fears, the BBC's Michael Buchanan looks at a near", "Rovers sparked outrage by signing Goodwillie in January 2022 and a loan move back to Clyde also collapsed.\n\nRape Crisis Scotland described the Raith Rovers move as another \"clear message of disregard\" to survivors of rape and sexual violence.\n\nThe forward was released without playing a game in September 2022, with Raith Rovers admitting it \"got it wrong\" by signing him.\n\nIn February this year, Northern Premier League side Radcliffe FC, based in Bury, Greater Manchester, released the striker after one game following a public outcry.\n\nFour months later, Goodwillie's contract with Australian semi-professional club Sorrento FC was rescinded. The club apologised to anyone \"that may have been caused offence by his signing\".\n\nPartygate investigator Sue Gray was offered a job as Keir Starmer's chief of staff in March\n\nSir Keir Starmer says he is confident that former senior civil servant Sue Gray has not broken any rules in talking to Labour about a role.\n\nMs Gray was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff in March.\n\nSir Keir also said he did not have any discussions with Ms Gray while she was investigating former PM Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Cabinet Office will update MPs later on its investigation into the circumstances around her resignation with a written statement.\n\nThe report is not expected to be the final judgement on Ms Gray's departure, which will come from the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\n\nThe watchdog is to recommend how long Ms Gray, who probed lockdown gatherings in Downing Street, should wait before being allowed to take up the job with Labour.\n\nSir Keir accused the government of using the issue to try and deflect from the local election campaign, saying it should be focusing on the cost-of-living crisis instead.\n\n\"[The public are] not sitting at their breakfast talking about Sue Gray, they're talking about their bills,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\nAsked whether Ms Gray had broken any code of conduct, Sir Keir said: \"Firstly I had no discussions with her whilst she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm confident she hasn't broken any of the rules.\"\n\nUnder the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.\n\nSenior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government.\n\nThe body provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.\n\nHowever, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by its recommendations.\n\nA long delay could hamper attempts to have Ms Gray in place well before the next general election, which is widely expected next year, to help Labour prepare for government if it wins power.\n\nCabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin has previously said Ms Gray's talks with Labour may have breached civil service rules, including the requirement to inform Acoba before a job offer is announced, and to clear contact with opposition parties with ministers.\n\nMs Gray became well known after she was chosen to look into the Partygate scandal last year.\n\nShe has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team, since joining the civil service in the 1970s.\n\nMs Gray resigned from the post of second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in March, after it emerged she had been offered a job with Labour.\n\nLabour has insisted it did not approach Ms Gray until after her Partygate report was published.\n\nBur Mr Johnson and his allies have seized on Labour's job offer to claim Ms Gray's investigation when he was in power was an attempt to smear him.\n\nHer report was critical of the senior political and civil service leadership, saying they \"must bear responsibility\" for the culture at No 10 during Covid lockdowns.\n\nIt contributed to Mr Johnson's downfall as prime minister, prompting numerous Conservative MPs to call on him to resign.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has told a court he is suing the publisher of the Daily Mirror to stop \"absolute intrusion and hate\" towards him and his wife.\n\nPrince Harry was giving evidence against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) over illegal newsgathering claims, including phone hacking.\n\nHe was choked-up as he finished giving evidence for a second day, and said it had been \"a lot\".\n\nMGN denies it used illegal methods to gather stories about the prince.\n\nAt London's High Court, the prince explained he started discussions about possible legal action after a chance-meeting in France in 2018 with David Sherborne, now his barrister.\n\nThe prince said before then he had no concerns over any particular newspaper stories due to unlawful activity because it \"was all contained in the Palace\".\n\nWhen asked about his discussions with lawyers after that chance meeting with Mr Sherborne, Prince Harry said he had wanted to put a stop to the \"absolute intrusion and hate that was coming towards\" him and the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHe said he also wanted to \"see if there was any way to find a different course of action, rather than relying on the Institution's way\".\n\nBut in cross-examination, Andrew Green KC, the lawyer representing the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People, suggested Harry had not found a single story that came from phone hacking.\n\nHarry replied \"there is hard evidence to suggest an incredible amount of suspiciousness\" over how stories were sourced and he believed burner phones were used \"extensively\", referring to phones that can be disposed of so no records are kept.\n\nPrince Harry alleges about 140 articles published between 1996 and 2010 - from his childhood into early adulthood - contained information gathered using unlawful methods, with a sample of 33 stories written about him being considered by the civil court.\n\nMany of the stories the prince claimed were obtained illegally concerned his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.\n\nIn a 2006 Sunday People article Ms Davy was said to have been \"screaming for half an hour\" at him on the phone and \"blew her top\" over his visit to a Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club in Berkshire.\n\nChelsy Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010\n\nAsked where he thought the information on her screaming had come from, the prince said: \"At this point, knowing that my girlfriend's number was bizarrely in the hands of Mirror journalists, that they probably looked through her call data and saw missed calls, late calls\u2026 and managed to put together a story based on that.\"\n\n\"It was very suspicious that they had her number,\" he added, and he did not believe she would have given the Mirror Group or any journalists her phone number.\n\nThe prince told the court he once found a tracking device on Ms Davy's car at a time when the press were reporting on what was described as a \"make-or-break\" holiday for the couple.\n\nHe also highlighted another article in The People in 2007 which reported a \"Palace source\" saying the couple had been having \"monumental\" rows and their relationship was \"in crisis after a string of bitter bust-ups\". Again he said it was \"incredibly suspicious\" as he had never discussed his relationship with the Palace.\n\nMr Green responded by saying we are in the \"land of total speculation about where this information might have come from\".\n\nThe couple broke up in 2010 after a six-year on-off relationship. She attended the prince's wedding to Meghan in Windsor in 2018.\n\nThe prince was also asked about The People publishing photographs of the prince, a friend Mark Dyer and the late TV presenter Caroline Flack meeting up.\n\nAt the time he suspected one of his friends had leaked the details after they were confronted by photographers. In turn this led him and his brother William to stop talking to Mr Dyer for some time afterwards.\n\nHowever he said: \"I now believe the information came from our voicemails\u2026 Even those I trusted the most, I ended up doubting.\"\n\nAsked how he would react if the court concluded that he had never been hacked by any MGN journalist, Harry said that he had been hacked on an \"industrial scale\" and he would \"feel some injustice\" if he did not win", "doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.\n\u2022 None Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdog\n\nThe stepfather of a five-year-old girl has pleaded guilty to her murder.\n\nNadia Zofia Kalinowska died after being found injured at her family home at Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey in December 2019.\n\nHer mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder.\n\nWhen the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.\n\nThe Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year.\n\nA minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.\n\nThe trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.\n\nDuring the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.\n\nAs well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.\n\nAlso present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.\n\nNadia was rushed to hospital from her home in Newtownabbey\n\nThis led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death.\n\nAs the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned.\n\nAt this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.\n\nAleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.\n\nThese pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.\n\nShe was remanded back into custody.\n\nAddressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each, he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.\n\nA spokesperson for the school said: \"Our school community is still in shock at this terrible tragedy. We have lost Nadia who was a much loved pupil.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted at this time.\"\n\nNohema Graber, 66, was prominent in the Spanish-speaking community\n\nA teenager in the US state of Iowa who beat his teacher to death with a baseball bat over a bad grade has been sentenced to life in prison.\n\nWillard Miller, 17, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in April for his role in the 2 November 2021 killing of Nohema Graber, a Spanish teacher.\n\nMiller and co-defendant Jeremy Goodale, now 18, attacked Ms Graber, 66, after she marked down Miller's work.\n\nAged 16 at the time of the murder, both were charged as adults.\n\nOn Thursday, Miller was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole only after at least 35 years.\n\nHe was also ordered to pay at least $150,000 (\u00a3117,000) in restitution to the victim's family.\n\nBefore delivering his sentence, Judge Shawn Showers rejected defence arguments that Miller was too young at the time to understand the gravity of his actions.\n\n\"Evil does not have a birthday,\" he said.\n\nFamily members of Ms Graber told the court they did not believe Miller was remorseful.\n\nSeveral relatives mentioned that the murder led to the early death last month of Ms Graber's husband, Paul. He was buried a day before Thursday's sentencing.\n\nMiller apologised to the community and turned to address Ms Graber's relatives seated behind him.\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry for the distress I have caused you and the devastation I have caused your family,\" he said.\n\nPleading with the judge to forego the maximum sentence, Miller said: \"I don't want to be institutionalised so long that I forget who I am and where I come from.\"\n\nProsecutors said the evidence showed both Miller and Goodale had bludgeoned Ms Graber with a bat during the attack in Fairfield, a town of fewer than 10,000 people that lies 100 miles (160km) south-east of the state capitol, Des Moines.\n\nThe day after the attack, police found the mother-of-three's body hidden under a tarpaulin, wheelbarrow and railway sleepers in a local park where she used to walk after school.\n\nIn a police interview, Miller described frustrations with the way Ms Graber taught Spanish.\n\nHe said his marks in her class were lowering his Grade Point Average, an important score during applications for US colleges and scholarships.\n\nMiller met Ms Graber at Fairfield High School on the day of the murder to discuss his poor grade in her class. Goodale was also a student there.\n\nMexican-born Ms Graber had been employed at the school since 2012. She was part of the town's small but growing Latino community.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin may have boasted he had the loyalty of all 25,000 members of his mercenary army, but it seems that may have shifted as quickly as the Wagner Group's rebellion petered out.\n\nIn online messages analysed by BBC Verify, Wagner troops and their relatives raged against Prigozhin's decision to halt his dramatic march on Moscow and withdraw from the captured city of Rostov.\n\n\"The bald waste of space destroyed Wagner PMC with his own hands. And screwed everyone he could,\" fumed one online poster claiming to be a Wagner fighter on a Telegram channel with 200,000 followers.\n\n\"It's been another senseless revolt,\" they added.\n\nTelegram is the social media platform of choice for Wagner soldiers and pro-war circles in Russia, allowing often anonymous communication with thousands of followers at a time.\n\nIt was where Prigozhin chose to announce his so-called \"March of Justice\" against the Russian regime, but it has now become the place where many have turned against him.\n\nMark Krutov, a journalist with the RFE/RL outlet's Russian Service, has access to the Telegram group chats used by relatives of Wagner fighters. He shared some of their messages with the BBC.\n\n\"They were simply betrayed,\" one woman wrote. \"I trusted Prigozhin, but what he did is dishonourable.\"\n\n\"He shouldn't have done this. This is pure betrayal,\" agreed another user.\n\nPrigozhin long enjoyed highly vocal support from a network of pro-Wagner influencers. For months, they have championed his actions and attacked his opponents in the Ministry of Defence - particularly his sworn enemy, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nBut when the Wagner mutiny was developing, their reaction was surprisingly muted.\n\nTwo of the largest groups, Grey Zone and Reverse Side of the Medal - with almost 900,000 followers between them - did not rush to endorse his actions, instead aiming for the reasonably neutral middle ground of blaming antagonism by Mr", "ificant inflationary pressure\" and increased project costs meant the government was to \"rephase construction by two years\".\n\nHe said the decision had been \"difficult\" but that it was part of \"controlling inflation and reducing government debt\".\n\nMark Thurston, chief executive of HS2 Ltd, recently told the BBC that he and the government were examining the phasing of the build and the timing.\n\nJohn Foster from business group CBI said the delay would harm investor confidence in the rail sector.\n\n\"Delays to projects may create short-term savings, but they can ultimately lead to higher overall costs and slow down the UK's transition to a better, faster and greener transport network,\" Mr Foster added.\n\nLabour said the decision to pause the HS2 at Birmingham was \"astonishing\".\n\nShadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said the party had committed to delivering HS2 in full if it gets into government, and to partly funding the work by its green prosperity plan.\n\nThe head of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Henri Murison, said the delay was \"disappointing\" and \"holds back economic benefits\".\n\nThe project is grappling with the rising cost of materials due to the high rate of inflation.\n\nThe government hopes that the delays will allow it to spread the cost over a longer period of time, making it more affordable by reducing annual expenditure.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt, who will outline his Budget next week, wants debt to fall as a percentage of GDP within five years - a target explicitly set by the Prime Minister.\n\nMichael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, which contains part of the HS2 line, said he would ask the government whether the delay \"marks the end of HS2 north of Birmingham for good and whether HS2 will make good the damage already done in southern Staffordshire\".\n\nHe added: \"Simply saying the project is delayed is not good enough. The area has been blighted by whole fields turned into construction sites.\"\n\nLast week, Mr Thurston said the impact of inflation had been \"significant\" in the past year, affecting the costs of raw material, labour, energy and fuel.\n\n\"We're looking at the timing of the project, the phasing of the project, we're looking at where we can use our supply chain to secure a lot of those things that are costing us more through inflation,\" he said.\n\nHS2 trains are scheduled to carry the first passengers between Old Oak Common station in West London and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033.\n\nEuston station in London is currently scheduled to open later, by 2035. Further stretches to Crewe and then to Manchester are due by 2034 and 2041.\n\nMost of the HS2 leg to Leeds was scrapped in 2021.\n\nBuzzfeed is to close its news site and cut its workforce by 15%, chief executive Jonah Peretti has said.\n\nIt comes as the digital media company faces serious financial challenges, including a slump in advertising spending.\n\nCalling the decisions \"deeply painful\", Mr Peretti said he could not invest more in the unprofitable news site.\n\nHe said the firm would focus on delivering news via the HuffPost, which Buzzfeed took over two years ago.\n\n\"Our industry is hurting and ready to be reborn,\" he said in a memo to staff. \"We are taking great pains today, and will begin to fight our way to a bright future.\"\n\nFounded in 2006, Buzzfeed was once one of the trendiest names in online media, known for its quizzes and viral content, as well as a serious news operation.\n\nBut the firm, which employed more than 1,300 people globally at the end of last year, has shifted away from news, as bringing in ad revenue and audiences became more difficult and other lines of business, such as producing custom content, grew more quickly.\n\nIt listed on the stock exchange in 2021, but raised far less money than it had hoped.\n\n\"While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we've determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,\" Mr Peretti wrote to staff.\n\nMany other advertising-reliant companies, including media firms and tech giants such as Facebook's owner Meta, have been making job cuts in recent months, while investors have been forced to reassess the values of upstart news ventures such as Vice News and Vox Media. News company Insider also revealed plans on Thursday to reduce its workforce by 10% or about 95 jobs.\n\nMr Peretti said his company, which will continue to operate HuffPost, its food brand Tasty, Complex Networks, and its namesake website, had faced wider challenges but he also blamed himself.\n\nHe said he had been \"slow to accept\" the difficulties of making money from online news with distribution dominated by big tech platforms. The firm should have generated more revenue after acquiring Complex in 2021, which runs the music site Complex and other brands, he added.\n\n\"I could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances.\" he said.\n\nIn her own memo to staff, parts of which she shared on social media, Buzzfeed News editor-in-chief Karolina Waclawiak said the company should have tried to build a business around its news site earlier, describing the closure as \"avoidable\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Buzzfeed said it expected to incur $7m (\u00a35.6m) - $11m (\u00a38.8m) in severance and other charges connected to the move.\n\nSome of the news staff may find roles in other parts of the firm, the company said.\n\nShares fell 20% on Thursday on the news, reducing Buzzfeed's market value to about $100m (\u00a380m) - a fraction of the more than $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) valuation investors were reportedly discussing just two years ago.\n\u2022 None Online news site Buzzfeed to take over HuffPost\n\nFormer BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood has been questioned twice under police caution over five alleged sex offences.\n\nIn a statement, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are now investigating five accusations of offences alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016.\n\nDetectives say they interviewed a 65-year-old man under caution on 15 March and 4 April. There has been no arrest.\n\nIt comes after BBC News and the Guardian uncovered allegations from 18 women. He denied those allegations.\n\nIn April last year, a number of women accused the former Radio 1 DJ of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017.\n\nThey also accused him of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of the women told us they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18.

Substitute goalkeeper Archie Mair, brought on to replace Sam Slocombe in the 120th minute, crucially saved spot-kicks from Darren Oldaker and Jeff King before Cedwyn Scott sealed a dramatic 4-3 shootout triumph. Victory for the 161-year-old Magpies, who were founder members of the Football League in 1888, ended their four-year non-league exile while defeat consigned Chesterfield to a sixth season in the National League. Ruben Rodrigues had bounced a volley off the turf and over goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons to level at 2-2 in the second half of extra time to ensure the showdown would be decided from the spot. Armando Dobra's curled finish had restored Chesterfield's lead in the first period of 15 additional minutes after an enthralling game ended 1-1 at the end of normal time. A calamitous start from Notts goalkeeper Slocombe - which had the Magpies defending a rare indirect free-kick inside the box after just two minutes - cost them dearly as his challenge on Andrew Dallas allowed the striker to put Chesterfield ahead from the spot. The Spireites had Notts scrambling to stay in touch at the break as the side that won a club-record 32 league games during the regular season struggled to muster a meaningful response. Sam Austin sent a shot over the bar from the edge of the area and Connell Rawlinson wastefully steered a header wide for a much-improved Notts after the break. Liam Mandeville squandered a late chance to seal victory moments before experienced Notts midfielder John Bostock caught Fitzsimons out with a set-piece that skipped in at the near post. Dobra edged the Derbyshire club back ahead three minutes after the restart and, after Macaulay Langstaff and Rawlinson went close to again restoring parity, it was Rodrigues who sent the final to a shootout.\n\u2022 None Relive the National League promotion final as it happened After four years and three failed play-off attempts - including defeat by Harrogate in a 2020 promotion final played behind closed doors at Wembley during the Covid-19 pandemic - Notts finally secured their English Football League (EFL) return at the end of a record-breaking season. Luke Williams' side were pipped for automatic promotion and the title by Hollywood-funded Wrexham, who topped the table with an all-time high 111 points. The 107 points the Magpies collected to finish second would have got them straight up as champions in every other season before this one. The club-record wins total and 117 goals in a campaign - which included a record 25-game unbeaten league run between September and February - would have counted for nothing if they had lost at the national stadium. Chesterfield finished one spot below Notts in the table, but the gap between the two was 23 points. They were the only side, other than Wrexham and Notts, to have a spell at the top of the table after the first month of the season - and they pushed Notts to their limits at Wembley in an incredible energy-sapping game. Chesterfield were presented with a bizarre chance almost immediately after kick-off when County conceded an indirect free-kick in the penalty area. Notts set their entire side up a yard in front of the goalline to block King's effort from the left of the penalty spot, but the uncertain start by the Magpies quickly got worse. Slocombe raced out to try shut Dallas down on the edge of the area, but caught the Spireites forward as he tried to lift the ball beyond the keeper. Dallas collected himself and went straight down the middle to beat Slocombe from the spot to put Chesterfield ahead after five chaotic minutes. Nervy Notts struggled to match frenetic Chesterfield for much of the first half, but Austin had a chance to level from close range in the 17th minute when he stretched to meet a lofted cross from Aaron Nemane. Dallas continued", "still needed, the skipper losing control of the ball as he dived backwards at square leg.\n\nThe target ticked down, the evening drew in. With three runs required and less than five overs remaining, Cummins deflected Ollie Robinson towards third man, a diving Harry Brook fumbled and Australia had an incredible victory.\n\nA series that has already lived up to the hype continues with the second Test at Lord's on 28 June.\n\u2022 None 'Cummins is The Boss but England can come back'\n\u2022 None Relive an incredible day with all the best clips\n\u2022 None Watch the highlights on Today at the Test\n\nThis was not just an homage to the epic contest on the same ground 18 years ago, but the perfect opening to the most anticipated Ashes series in a generation.\n\nFrom the moment Zak Crawley crunched the first ball of the series for four, this Test had everything: England's daring first-day declaration, Root's attempted reverse-ramp off Cummins from the first ball of day four and the fascinating clash of style between the two teams.\n\nBut none of that could match the nerve-shredding drama of the final hour, played out in front of a buoyant crowd that had earlier waited until 14:15 BST for rain to pass and play to begin.\n\nEngland have been involved in some thrilling Tests since Stokes took charge, but none with the stakes as high as this. In truth, they wasted chances throughout, but have shown enough quality, endeavour and bravery to suggest they have what it takes to get back into the series.\n\nFor Australia, the narrow win just about vindicates their cautious approach to combatting England's Bazballers. It was fitting that captain Cummins, the architect of the safety-first plan, played the vital role on the final day.\n\nThis was magnificent sporting theatre, whetting the appetite for the rest of the series and for the Test between England and Australia's women, which begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nCummins and Lyon get revenge 18 years in the making\n\nIn 2005, Australia arrived on the fourth morning needing 107 with only two wickets remaining and almost got them thanks to the efforts of their last three batters - Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nFrom a position almost as hopeless, Cummins and Lyon launched their own rescue mission and this time got Australia over the line.\n\nThe tourists had been almost inert for most of the day. At 107-3 overnight, they did not shift from a neutral gear. Khawaja, who made a century in the first innings, added only 31 runs from 116 balls and looked immovable.\n\nStokes somehow conjured the slower ball from his fragile body and Root held on to Carey to make England favourites, but fearsome competitors Cummins and Lyon refused to yield.\n\nRoot had already failed to cling on to a low caught-and-bowled chance when Cummins had six and the captain would later make him pay by crashing 14 from a single over.\n\nIn the next over, Stokes flung himself at a catch that would have matched his grab in the 2019 World Cup, but this time could not hold on.\n\nThe new ball was belatedly taken, but Australia's confidence grew. For every time the outside edge was beaten, a single was pinched. Cummins slapped Robinson past a flying Ollie Pope at cover, Lyon twice belted Stuart Broad down the ground for fours.\n\nThe outside edge was beaten, England kept the field back, James Anderson was ignored. Australia were within one hit of victory for more than two overs.\n\nWith three required, Cummins fended off a short ball and the flailing Brook could not prevent the boundary. Australia ended on 282 - their target back in 2005 - and the brilliant Cummins threw his bat in the air to begin wild celebrations.\n\nEngland had lost two of their past 12 Tests and one of those, against New Zealand in Wellington in February, was by just one run after they had made the Black Caps follow on.\n\nThis, though, will test the resolve of their new attitude under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum like never before. Not because their swashbuckling style has failed its first examination by Australia, but because they were so close to winning and it is their own errors that have cost them.\n\nThey missed eight chances of varying difficulty in the field, four of which were by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Most crucially, Bairstow failed to move for an edge when Khawaja had only five on the fourth evening.\n\nQuestions will linger over Stokes' decision to declare on the first evening and the fitness of Moeen Ali, who was badly hampered by a cut on his spinning finger throughout the match.\n\nIt was also telling that Stokes, who is managing a left-knee injury, did not bowl himself until the 70th over of the second innings and that Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, was not trusted with the second new ball.\n\nNo team has come from behind to win an Ashes series since 2005. Stokes' England have shown they can get at Australia, but they must be near-perfect in the remaining four Tests if they are to win the urn for the first time since 2015.\n\u2022 None How did Messi win the World Cup with Argentina?

Police have told them that they cannot rule out the possibility of a so-called copycat attack, says Michael Tsifidaris, who speaks for the community here.\n\nHe's smartly dressed in a business suit, but looks exhausted. It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.\n\nHe tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\"\n\nThe fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.\n\nThere are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.\n\nDetectives investigating the mass shooting have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".\n\nMr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.\n\nThose who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".\n\nThe police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris.\n\n\"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\"\n\nFor now, the community is meeting online. Mr Tsifidaris, who refers to his fellow members as brothers and sisters, speaks often of the comfort to be found in supporting one another. \"We pray together, we cry together.\"\n\nUppermost in their thoughts are those who remain seriously injured in hospital. He's adam", "ks with President Putin as \"frank, open and friendly\".\n\nHis visit to Russia came days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin on war crimes allegations.\n\nThe state visit was mirrored by Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's surprise visit to Kyiv - making him the first leader of Japan to visit a country in conflict since World War Two.\n\nPresident Zelensky said he will join the G7 summit in Japan in May via video link at the invitation of Mr Kishida.\n\nHe told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon that he had also asked China to get involved in talks but was waiting for an answer.\n\n\"We offered China to become a partner in the implementation of the peace formula,\" he said. \"We invite you to the dialogue; we are waiting for your answer.\"\n\nBrothers Maksym (left) and Ivan (right) signed up to fight for Ukraine together after Russia launched its full-scale invasion\n\nMaksym had been fighting for 200 hours without a break when he was killed by a Russian sniper in the city of Bakhmut.\n\n\"For eight days he did not eat, or sleep,\" his mother Lilia says. \"He couldn't even close his eyes for five minutes because the sniper could shoot.\"\n\nThere's a reason why she now calls Bakhmut \"hell\". It's the city that took the life of one son and left her only other child seriously injured.\n\nHer one scant comfort - that one died saving the life of the other.\n\nMaksym and Ivan volunteered to fight when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. At the time Maksym was 22 years old and Ivan just 18.\n\nIvan, the younger brother who still carries the scars, says they were inseparable. \"He was always with me and I with him. For me, he was the dearest person.\"\n\nIvan shows me videos and photos of them together - in a trench, in a military vehicle, trying to get some rest.\n\nAs time passes, you see two smiling, handsome young men change, gradually appearing wearier as war strips away their innocence.\n\nThe two brothers were inseparable - fighting and resting together at the front\n\nTheir last moments together were spent engaged in brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut. \"It was impossible to sleep there. We were being attacked 24/7,\" Ivan says.\n\nThe brothers' unit was trapped in a windowless room of a building. They'd had to punch through walls to make firing positions. That's when they received an order to pull back.\n\nIvan recalls the moment before he was wounded. \"I remember I was reloading; I came out from behind a wall and there was a flash. I was paralysed and I fell.\"\n\nHe says he then felt the warmth of the blood flowing from his injuries to his face. He didn't think he'd survive. \"I thought I was done; I'll bleed out and that'll be it.\"\n\nBut Maksym came running to his rescue and dragged him back inside a building for cover.\n\n\"He revived me, took out my broken teeth and began to give me first aid,\" says Ivan. That included piercing a hole in Ivan's throat to prevent him from choking.\n\nIvan shares a video of his brother tenderly wiping the blood away soon after the explosion. Another widely shared clip shows Ivan struggling to walk with a gaping wound to his face, but still clutching his Ukrainian flag: a symbol of bravery and resistance in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nIvan has no doubts that he would have died if it weren't for Maksym's actions. \"My brother didn't let me die. He saved me.\"\n\nIvan (seen here recovering in hospital) had a hole cut in his throat by his brother to help him keep breathing\n\nMaksym urgently called on the radio for help. But the first medics that tried to reach him were all killed in their vehicle when it was struck by a Russian anti-tank missile. It took another nine hours before Ivan could be rescued.\n\nAnd then came Maksym's extraordinary act of self-sacrifice. Rather than travel with his brother to safety, he volunteered to stay in Bakhmut, to lead their unit.\n\nStill fighting there a week later, Maksym was killed by a Russian sniper.\n\nIn Ukraine the funerals of soldiers are now as constant as the sound of artillery on the front line. But they're not all like Maksym's. Alongside his grieving family, the entire town of Tomakivka had come out to pay their respects.\n\nThey knelt as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery - some clasping flowers or Ukraine's flag. The prayers and sombre music accompanied by tears and sobbing.\n\nSerhii (left) and Lilia were supported by the entire town at their older son's funeral\n\nFor the past year, Maksym and Ivan's parents had been living their sons' battles vicariously. Lilia and Serhii were having sleepless nights too - waiting anxiously to hear from their boys. They'd often receive a short text to reassure them, says Lilia - \"We're good, mum.\"\n\nBut then came the news they'd been dreading.\n\nLilia weeps over Maksym's coffin before it's finally lowered into the ground - accompanied by a volley of gunfire. \"We still can't believe it. My soul is torn,\" Lilia tells me after the funeral. She says her only reason to continue living is for her younger son.\n\nShe tells me Maksym had the chance to leave with Ivan, but he would not abandon their younger, less experienced comrades.\n\n\"He's a hero. He's an angel. He's sunshine. He would never leave his brother even though he knew he would die himself.\"\n\nUkraine won't say how many lives have been lost in this war. But look around the cemetery and you soon realise the entire country is paying an extremely heavy price.\n\nMy brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood\n\nAt this one small graveyard, in this one small town, there are rows and rows of freshly dug graves surrounded by flowers. Maksym's was one of three soldiers' funerals the local priest was conducting that week.\n\nFor Roman, who was once himself a soldier before taking holy orders, it was harder than most. He is a family friend and prayed with Maksym and Ivan's parents for the safe return of their boys, whom he knew.\n\n\"You often have to bury soldiers,\" said Roman. \"But not your friends.\"\n\nAt the funeral, Ivan is still clutching the Ukrainian flag which he carried when wounded - signed by his comrades including his brother. The blood from his own wounds staining the blue and yellow cloth.\n\nI ask him if he now regrets his decision to join the army. He replies: \"We understood that we might not return, but it's an honour to fight for Ukraine. That's why I don't regret it in any way.\n\n\"My brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood.\"\n\nThe BBC Singers, a choir of 20 musicians, had been due to close in July\n\nThe BBC has paused its decision to close the BBC Singers, after \"a number of organisations\" came forward to offer alternative funding.\n\nThe group, which is the UK's only full-time professional chamber choir, was targeted by budget cuts shortly before celebrating its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe proposal sparked a backlash, with 140,000 people signing a petition urging the BBC to reverse its decision.\n\nA temporary reprieve has been granted, as new funding models are explored.\n\n\"I am confident that this does secure their future,\" said Simon Webb, the BBC's head of orchestras and choirs.\n\n\"But this has all happened just in the last few days - and what we're looking for now is a little bit of time to quietly, confidentially have conversations with these external partners.\"\n\nHe declined to name the organisations involved but said the choir would still be called the BBC Singers - a name they adopted in 1972, having previously been known as the Wireless Singers, the BBC Chorus, the Variety Chorus and even the Kentucky Minstrels.\n\nThe BBC also confirmed that the ensemble would appear at this year's Proms concerts.\n\nPreviously, the 20-member choir had been due to close in July, meaning they would miss the summer music festival entirely.\n\nJonathan Manners, producer and acting co", "He called me right back and we sent him a script,\" says George. \"That started the ball rolling.\"\n\nMark ended up curating the soundtrack, writing the score and penning the film's closing song, Dance the Night Away, with Dua Lipa.\n\nDolly Chartin': Dua Lipa's song Dance the Night Away was the first song from the soundtrack to be released\n\nThe soundtrack's also played a big part in Barbie's massive marketing campaign.\n\nSongs from the 17-track album have been steadily released in the run-up to the film's release, which George says has \"helped fuel excitement for the movie\".\n\n\"It was a perfect symbiotic relationship of the music driving the movie and the movie driving the music,\" he says.\n\n\"Once you saw the movie and how well the music works, as soon as they left the theatre people went out and got the album.\"\n\nAnd, this being Barbie, physical copies of the soundtrack are available in \"cotton candy\" vinyl and on transparent pink cassette tapes.\n\nNicki Minaj collaborated with Ice Spice to release Barbie World, which has been streamed more than 42m times on YouTube\n\nGeorge refuses to reveal his favourite track but says he was \"blown away\" by Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For.\n\nHe says the singer was shown just 25 minutes of the film and managed to \"take what she'd seen and encapsulate it into this heartbreaking song of being a woman\".\n\nGeorge says he's very proud of the album and its success in the charts is \"the icing on the cake\".\n\n\"It's Barbie's world, we just live in it,\" he says.\n\nAqua's Barbie Girl, sampled in Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice's movie song, also returned to the chart for the first time since its original release in 1997.\n\nAnd while plastic sure is fantastic, Dave and Central Cee kept the top spot, with Sprinter entering its eighth week at number one.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo also sunk her teeth deeper into the number two slot, holding firm with Vampire.\n\nAs recently as 2018, The Greatest Showman soundtrack sold 2.1m copies in the UK, outpacing new releases by Drake and Ariana Grande.\n\nBut the idea of chart-topping artists working together on a blockbuster movie had largely fallen out of favour in the era of superhero franchises and cinematic universes.\n\nEven before that, young adult movies like Twilight and Hunger Games were aligning themselves with credible alternative artists like Paramore, Iron & Wine and The National. Lorde even curated the (superb) music for Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt 1.\n\nOver the last few years, there have been flickers of the traditional soundtrack album returning. OneRepublic's I Ain't Worried was a breakout hit from last year's Top Gun Maverick; and Post Malone & Swae Lee's Sunflower (from Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse) was a top three single in 2018.\n\nBut, just like the movie, the Barbie soundtrack is confounding expectations. The tracklist is like a who's who of modern pop - Lizzo, Ice Spice, PinkPantheress, Dua Lipa.

The force has declined to comment.\n\nWildcat Haven, based in St Asaph, Denbighshire, has said he suffered \"physiological and psychological trauma\", and has made a number of claims about police actions.\n\nWildcat Haven's lawyer, Joseph Morgan, said the group found the animal dehydrated, soaking wet and close to death as a three-week-old kitten in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nBelieving he was a Scottish wildcat, he was taken to an enclosure in Conwy for rehabilitation before eventual release.\n\nPlans to release Finlay in spring 2022 were derailed on Valentine's Day in February that year, when officers took him from the farm claiming he was being held without a licence.\n\nWildcat Haven claimed no licence was required to rehabilitate Finlay.\n\nMr Morgan said: \"North Wales Police acted excessively in seizing Finlay from Wildcat Haven's care and holding on to him for over four months.\n\n\"In doing so, they undermined months of hard work that went into rehabilitating Finlay for release into the wild, meaning that Wildcat Haven has had to start from square one in their journey to see Finlay in the wild again.\"\n\nWildcat Haven is also unhappy police do not believe Finlay is a wildcat, but a domestic tabby with some wildcat genes.\n\nThe assessment could pose problems for the group if it does release Finlay into the wild, as it could be committing an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.\n\nFinlay was not returned until 28 June 2022, allegedly in a \"very poor state\". Wildcat Haven said it took more than six months to bring him back to good health.\n\nIts director Emily O'Donoghue said: \"Finlay was wrongly seized as no licence is required for the rehabilitation and release of a Scottish wildcat.\"\n\nShe claimed that he was kept \"in a quarantine cage for four-and-a-half months\", and on his return he was \"emaciated\".\n\nWildcat Haven said Finlay was discovered in the Scottish Highlands as a kitten\n\n\"The police returned him because they said he was a domestic tabby cat, even though an assessment of him arranged by the police gave him a score which should have identified him as a Scottish wildcat, according to the scientific literature,\" Ms O'Donoghue said.\n\nThe police, she claimed, caused Finlay to \"suffer unnecessarily\" and delayed his release.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for his freedom,\" she said.\n\nWhile North Wales Police has declined to comment on Wildcat Haven's claims, it has previously said it kept Finlay at a special facility where it had regular visits and vet assessments.\n\nIt said there was no evidence of disease and Finlay displayed traits of domestic cat behaviour.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nWhat started with pictures in Edinburgh, took Ross Burns to locations all around the UK including the Finnieston Crane in Glasgow\n\nWhen Ross Burns first took a photo of one of his son's toy cars while on a daily walk he did not think it would turn into an obsession that has seen him complete 1,000 days of taking pictures in different locations.\n\nIt started as a lockdown project in 2020 but he caught the bug and it turned into a three-year project capturing images of his son's Hot Wheels miniature cars in locations from Edinburgh Castle to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe 43-year-old, from Edinburgh, said he started taking out the toy cars when he went for walks with his six-year-old son Daniel.\n\nHe posted the pictures on his Instagram account and received an encouraging reaction. So he carried on.\n\nWhen restrictions began to ease, he decided to take the cars all around the UK.\n\n\"It's also been a fun hobby for me and Daniel to do together,\" Ross says.\n\n\"He likes copying my photos and creating his own. Seeing him sprawled flat on a pavement to get the perfect angle is pretty funny.\"\n\nRoss, the head of communications at Edinburgh Napier University, says that after a few weeks he set himself the challenge of doing it for a full year and then he would stop.\n\n\"But clearly I was hooked and another 635 days on, I'm still", "an impact on tourism, a High Court judge in London heard.\n\nLast month 50 full-time and 45 part-time staff at the hotel were told that their jobs would be terminated on 10 July, the same day asylum seekers are due to move in.\n\nThe hotel has seen faced local opposition since it first announced the plans\n\nA lawyer for Stradey Park's owner, Gryphon Leisure, said there was an \"urgent\" need for asylum seeker accommodation, arguing there would be no planning breach.\n\nThe court was told Gryphon director Robert Horwood had warned there was a \"serious\" risk the hotel would shut without its contract with accommodation provider Clearsprings Ready Homes.\n\nCraig Howell Williams KC, for the council, said there were \"good reasons\" to doubt Mr Horwood's claims the business could face closure.\n\nThe barrister said the former Edwardian stately home played a \"fundamental\" role in tourism.\n\nThe court was told there was limited information about how the site would be operated for migrants.\n\nThe use of bodyguards and perimeter patrols would be \"alien\" in the neighbourhood, Mr Howell Williams said.\n\nHe added there were \"concerns\" about community feeling, including the \"potential for unrest\".\n\nJenny Wigley KC, for Clearsprings, Gryphon, Mr Horwood and co-director Gareth Street, said in written arguments using the hotel was \"a temporary solution of last resort\".\n\nShe said if people were not accommodated asylum seekers were at risk of being kept in sub-standard conditions or being made homeless.\n\nPolice were called to the hotel on Friday after protesters blocked vehicles entering the site\n\nJudge Gavin Mansfield KC will give his reasons for dismissing the injunction bid at a hearing on Monday.\n\nAfter the hearing, Carmarthenshire council leader Darren Price said he was \"disappointed\" and that the authority would consider the judge's reasons on Monday.\n\nIn May, West Lindsey District Council lost its attempt to get an injunction against work to prepare RAF Scampton, in Lincolnshire, for asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in June Braintree council lost a High Court appeal over Home Office plans to house asylum seekers at a former airbase.\n\nA successful legal action pursued by Great Yarmouth Borough Council, in Norfolk, saw a High Court judge rule that seafront hotels there could not be used to house migrants.\n\nOn Friday, police were called to Stradey Park Hotel as protesters stopping cars from accessing the site clashed with security personnel who were pulling down fences erected by demonstrators previously.\n\nThe Home Office said the number of people arriving in the UK in need of accommodation had reached record levels.\n\n\"The Home Office is committed to making every effort to reduce hotel use and limit the burden on the taxpayer,\" a spokesman added.\n\nCrowds have lined the streets to celebrate West Ham football club's Europa Conference League final victory over Fiorentina.\n\nThe win meant that West Ham achieved the club's first major trophy for 43 years.\n\nFans of David Moyes' team gathered to watch the trophy parade through the streets of London.\n\nDr Susan Gilby said she faced \"offensively sexist comments\" in meetings\n\nA former NHS chief executive is suing her employer, saying she was \"bullied, harassed, intimidated and undermined\" by the hospital trust's chairman.\n\nIn legal papers, seen by BBC News, Dr Susan Gilby alleges she was effectively unfairly dismissed by the Countess of Chester NHS Foundation Trust, after she made a formal complaint.\n\nShe has also accused the chairman of putting finance above patient safety.\n\nIn a statement, the trust said it denied all the allegations.\n\nDr Gilby, a consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care, was appointed as medical director and assistant chief executive of the NHS trust, in August 2018.\n\nHer arrival came a month after nurse Lucy Letby was arrested on suspicion of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill 10 others at one of the trust's hospitals in Cheshire. Ms Letby's trial is ongoing and she denies the charges.\n\nWhen the chief executive resigned in September that year, Dr Gilby was promoted to the role.\n\nAccording to documents prepared for a forthcoming employment tribunal, Dr Gilby alleges the problems began when a new chairman, Ian Haythornthwaite, was appointed in late 2021.\n\nShe claims that soon after joining the trust, Mr Haythornthwaite - a former BBC accountant - sought to \"intervene and influence, and ultimately to control, many operational matters\" beyond the scope of his job.\n\nDr Gilby's claim alleges that the chairman had an \"extremely and unnecessarily aggressive\" approach, with subordinates \"increasingly frightened of crossing him\".\n\nShe also accuses him of appointing friends to the trust's board and putting finance above patient safety.\n\nDr Gilby claims the chairman was \"highly aggressive and intimidatory\" in meetings, that he banged his hand on a desk to emphasise his point, and oversaw a climate where \"offensively sexist comments and ferocious and repetitive criticisms\" were made by either him or his associates.\n\nDr Gilby's complaint accuses the chairman of putting finance above patient safety at the hospital trust\n\nShe made a formal whistle-blowing complaint against the chairman in July 2022, raising her concerns about his behaviour to both the trust and NHS England.\n\nThe trust responded to her concerns, Dr Gilby claims, by proposing that she be seconded to a senior advisory role within NHS England on the condition she withdrew her allegations.\n\nNHS England also contacted her about a role. Dr Gilby responded to the offer in November saying she was not willing to withdraw her allegations; she was suspended by the trust on 2 December. On 5 December, she gave the trust six months' notice of her intention to resign.\n\nDr Gilby is suing the trust and Mr Haythornthwaite for constructive unfair dismissal.\n\nIn a statement, the Countess of Chester NHS Trust said: \"There are significant points of dispute between Dr Gilby and the trust and the trust denies all allegations that she has raised. A number of active internal investigations are in train and the trust will not provide any further comment whilst those investigations are ongoing.\"\n\nMr Haythornthwaite said he had \"nothing to add at this time\" to the trust's statement.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: How to keep safe from wildfire smoke\n\nWashington DC and Philadelphia experienced their worst air quality in years as intense wildfires in Canada continue to impact millions.\n\nThe poor conditions have forced event cancellations and grounded flights across the US.\n\nNearly 100 million people are experiencing very poor air quality in North America.\n\nUS President Joe Biden described the fires as a \"stark reminder of the impacts of climate change\".\n\nData from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality Index (AQI) shows that cities in North America had the worst air quality in the world on Thursday morning.\n\nCities including Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York had significantly worse air quality than cities abroad such as Lahore, Dhaka and Hanoi.\n\nThe smoke has caused the cancellation of school outings and sporting events, and, in the capitol, the White House's planned pride celebrations.\n\nThe National Zoo was also closed, with its animals, including three giant pandas, taken indoors to shelter.\n\nIn nearby Baltimore, residents were wearing masks as they went about their day-to-day activities. One local, Sean Montague, said people \"have to put your health first and be cautious\".\n\nAt the city's Inner Harbour, friends Sharifah and Sheila disembarked from a water taxi, eager to hurry indoors.\n\nThey said they originally planned to spend the day in Baltimore's Fells Point, a waterside neighbourhood known for its galleries, shops and outdoor seafood restaurants.\n\nBut once on the water, their eyes stung and the smoke was so thick, so they agreed the ride was \"miserable\" and decided to return home.\n\nMuch of the smoke is coming from Quebec, where 150 fires are burning. It is already Quebec's worst fire season on record.\n\nSome areas of Canada continued to experience very high levels of contamination on Thurs", "Easter sales to buy things we need. I picked up 10 pairs of underpants in Asda for \u00a34.80 for our youngest boy, saving \u00a31.20.\n\nWe went to Sports Direct to buy outdoors shoes for the kids for \u00a35.99.\n\nWe're eating together as a family tonight, so I bought some flowers for Mum for \u00a36.00 at Asda. She deserves a treat because she really helped us out last week when our little boy had his tonsils and adenoids out.\n\nOver the weekend, we spent money on an Easter trail, so we're trying to keep the costs down today.\n\nJanine tried to keep her kids entertained during school holidays without breaking the bank\n\nThe weather was nice, so we dashed out to the park in the morning. I use vouchers, coupons and promotions for little treats like coffee, or eating out.\n\nWe needed some food from Tesco so I tied it into the day out. I spent just under \u00a315.00 on bits for tea. I bought the kids a slice of pizza and a sausage roll for \u00a33.55 at Greggs. My coffee was free from my O2 app so that kept me going until we got home.\n\nMy \u00a313.49 gym membership went out today. A woman came round to buy a post box shape sorter I sold on Facebook for \u00a33.00.\n\nMy husband took the kids to the cinema this morning because I needed time to shoot some videos. I opened The Thrifty Family blog and Tiktok account back in October to talk about the financial challenges we face. This brings in around \u00a31,600 per month.\n\nWe had two free tickets on our Vitality Life insurance app so I paid \u00a35.99 for one ticket and we took our own snacks in. I had my MoT today and thankfully the car gods were with me. It cost \u00a354.00 and everything was ok. We bought the car on finance and we pay \u00a3205.00 per month. It won't be paid off for another couple of years.\n\nI organised a trip to Grandma's for the kids today. In the past I would have probably booked a holiday somewhere, but now we've got to stick to budgets.\n\nShe kept costs down by organising outdoor activities with her sons\n\nI managed to get my hair cut - the first time I've had chance to go since January. It cost \u00a335.00 for a cut and blow dry. I colour it myself and spend a fiver every couple of months.\n\nThis is turning out to be an expensive week. My spending today was \u00a335.00 plus \u00a33.00 tip.\n\nIt was big shop day today. The Tesco delivery arrived and it cost \u00a3139.88. We pay \u00a37.99 for a delivery saver every month which means I can track how much we spend each week and there's no temptation to load up the trolley with things we don't need. If we run out in between we go to Aldi.\n\nIt rained all day in Manchester, typical in the school holidays. I took the kids for lunch to M&S because kids eat for free. It cost \u00a319.51.\n\nI met some friends today. We all live in different parts of the country so Birmingham was the middle ground.\n\nI made sandwiches for the train to save on money and took a bottle of water with me. I had an iced coffee for \u00a33.50. My train ticket cost \u00a336.29.\n\nWe wandered around town then headed to Dishoom for food and cocktails. We split the bill and it's was \u00a350.50. I also had a cheeky beer in Wetherspoons for \u00a32.69.\n\nToday was the first day this week that we didn't spend any money.\n\nThe kids wanted a pyjama day so we watched films and ate Easter eggs. I think shared experiences are all that matters. You don't have to throw loads of money at things. Time is the nicest gift that you can give people, especially your kids.\n\nJanine's train journey was cheaper because she bought tickets in advance\n\nMy total week's spending was \u00a3399.19 excluding my regular costs and extra income from selling things.\n\nWhen you break it down day by day, it seems crazy. But this wasn't a normal week for me. When the kids are off you end up spending much more money.\n\nI hope people realise that there are ways to still enjoy your life without having to fork out loads. Promotions, vouchers and apps can bring the price down. When you're doing it everyday it really adds up.\n\nAs told to Yazmina Garcia.

Brecon Beacons National Park will now be calling itself only by its Welsh name, Bannau Brycheiniog\n\nThe decision was aimed at promoting local culture and heritage, as part of a wider overhaul of how the park is managed.\n\nThe new campaign group - called \"Our Bannau Brycheiniog/Brecon Beacons\" - is made up of range of businesses in the fields of tourism, farming, green energy, hospitality and retail.\n\nHelen Howarth says losing the English language name will hurt tourism\n\nThey said they were proud of operating in a bilingual nation and believed \"this tradition must be protected and respected\".\n\nThey said they were also seeking legal advice about whether they could mount a High Court challenge, which would argue the park's rebrand conflicts with the 1993 Welsh Language Act obliging public bodies in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis.\n\n\"I firmly believe that losing our identity as the Brecon Beacons National Park will be detrimental to us all and especially tourism, hospitality and trade,\" said Helen Howarth, who owns a self-catering accommodation business.\n\nThe group has penned an open letter to park bosses calling on them \"to reinstate the bilingual Bannau Brycheiniog/ Brecon Beacons National Park name and brand\".\n\nThey say a number of the campaign's signatories are part of a scheme to be official ambassadors for the park and were \"not even notified about the renaming and rebranding project before its launch on 17 April\".\n\nNigel Kilgallon says the name change seems like \"an act of sabotage\"\n\nNigel Kilgallon, who runs a B&B in Brecon and is a town councillor, said the name change highlights the disconnect between the authority that runs the national park, and the local community.\n\n\"You could call it a trademark, you could call it intellectual property, you could call it a marketing tool. All these things that it could be. But it's also the home of the people that live here. Our Brecon Beacons,\" he said.\n\n\"And so to just change it, just seems like an act of sabotage. It's either that or it's just ill-thought out by the authority.\n\n\"It's what it's always known as and that bilingualism is really at the heart of what we're trying to do here.\"\n\nOwen Williams, the managing director of a digital marketing agency, said he found it difficult to understand the campaigners' argument.\n\nThe attention the national park had received through its decision in recent weeks had been \"unreal\", he claimed.\n\n\"It's been a very canny marketing strategy,\" he said.\n\nReferring to moves in other countries such as Australia to focus on the indigenous names for iconic sites he said \"tourism doesn't drop because the Ayres Rock name is minimised and Uluru brought to the fore\".\n\nA spokeswoman for Bannau Brycheiniog National", "Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast: \"I need the answer to that question to be 'yes' and at the moment trust in the police has been hugely damaged.\"\n\nResponding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Sir Mark should \"go further and faster\" to uncover the Met's systemic problems.\n\nHe said: \"The biggest danger today is that this just becomes another report.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said today was \"one of the darkest days in the 200-year history\" of the Met, but he was not surprised as it chimed with his own personal and professional experiences.\n\nHe insisted the force did not need to be broken up, but said systemic issues needed addressing.\n\nFour groups - the Runnymede Trust, Inquest, Liberty and Stonewall - said they \"stand united in our call for the roll back of the policing powers\" of the Met, and it was increasingly clear communities \"do not consent to the violent, predatory and discriminatory policing that we are currently offered\".\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

The government said its aim was to improve Covid surveillance of travellers arriving at London's main airport from China by helping to detect potential new variants.\n\nThe government said an average of 99 people per flight had been tested, totalling 3,374 passengers.\n\nDuring that period, 14 positive cases were identified, but none was deemed to be a variant of concern.\n\nThe DHSC said from Friday, 17 March \"passengers aged 18 or over travelling from mainland China and arriving at Heathrow Airport will no longer be invited to take a voluntary test on arrival\".\n\n\"The ending of this enhanced surveillance is in line with international partners such as the EU who are reducing border measures to monitor new variants from China\" .\n\nOfficials said the government would maintain a range of contingency measures to \"enable detection, and swift and proportionate action, for potential new harmful variants\" should the need arise.\n\nLast December, ministers confirmed that passengers arriving to England from China would have to provide a negative Covid test before they boarded their flights.\n\nThe Chinese government was reporting about 5,000 cases a day at the time, but analysts said the numbers were vastly undercounted - and that the daily caseload could have been closer to one million.\n\nOther countries around the world such as the US, France India also implemented testing.\n\nWhile the decision only affected English airports, the government said that despite their being no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, that it was working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy was applied UK-wide.\n\nIn January, China reopened its borders to international visitors for the first time since it imposed travel restrictions in March 2020 while officials declared later that month that the country's current wave of Covid-19 infections was \"coming to an end\".\n\nChina's National Health Commission stopped publishing data on Covid cases and deaths on 25 December after the relaxation of its zero-Covid policy and in February declared a \"decisive victory\" over the pandemic.\n\nWhen this cow ran onto an interstate, police in Michigan relied on a cowboy to lasso the suspect bovine.

The Acropolis in Athens - the country's most popular tourist attraction - was closed during the hottest hours of Friday and Saturday to protect visitors.\n\nMatt Finden, 51, from Vancouver, Canada, and his family were among the last tourists to visit The Acropolis before it closed.\n\n\"It was incredible up there. But along the way we saw people passed out getting medical attention, sitting on the backs of ambulances and even vomiting from heatstroke,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe Red Cross has been offering water and first aid at the site, which sits on a rocky hilltop and offers little shade to visitors.\n\nThere are also fears of a greater risk of wildfires, especially in areas with high winds. Greece suffered major wildfires in 2021 in another exceptional heatwave.\n\nElsewhere, a forest fire on the Spanish island of La Palma forced the evacuation of at least 500 people, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe fire broke out in the early hours of Saturday morning in El Pinar de Puntagorda, destroying at least 11 houses, Fernando Clavijo, president of the Canary Islands, said.\n\nVolunteers from the Hellenic Red Cross handing out water bottles in Athens on Friday\n\nHigh temperatures have also been reaching into central parts of Europe, with Germany and Poland among countries affected.\n\nCzech Republic's meteorological office issued a warning that temperatures over the weekend could go above 38C, which is exceptionally high for the country.\n\nHighs of up to 47C are expected across some parts of southern Spain, south-eastern Italy and possibly Greece later in the week. It is likely that some city records will be broken.\n\nIn the UK, however, heavy showers and gusty winds are expected in parts of England on Saturday.\n\nMeteorologists said this was because the southern shift of the jet stream, which was fuelling the hot weather in Europe, was also drawing low-pressure systems into the UK - bringing unsettled and cooler weather.\n\nThe current heatwave in Europe has been named Cerberus by the Italian Meteorological Society, after the three", "acceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said.\n\nAlim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London.\n\nOne of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected.\n\nAlim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that.\n\n\"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.\n\nBills could rise after water suppliers in England said they were ready to spend \u00a310bn on tackling sewage spills.\n\nThe privately owned companies have apologised for the amount of contaminated water being discharged into rivers and seas, amid mounting public anger over the practice.\n\nSome campaigners have cautiously welcomed the move, but others say firms are shifting the cost on to billpayers.\n\nThe industry paid out \u00a31.4bn to shareholders in 2022.\n\nMusician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey called it a \"half apology\" that was another attempt to extract more money from customers.\n\n\"What I am actually hearing is no apology for the fact we have paid them for a service we haven't got, they are now suggesting we pay them a second time for a service we haven't had,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"We should have an apology for the suggestion they are going to put bills up by \u00a310bn for their incompetence and their greed. This is nothing to celebrate.\"\n\nCompanies are sometimes allowed to spill sewage into open water following heavy rainfall to prevent the system becoming overloaded and backing up into people's homes.\n\nBut campaigners have long said these spills are happening too often. In 2022, raw sewage was dumped into rivers and seas for 1.75 million hours - or 825 times a day on average.\n\nUntreated sewage contains bacteria such as E.coli and viruses like hepatitis, that can be harmful to animals and humans. Swimming in water where untreated sewage is discharged can lead to serious illnesses such as stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections.\n\nWildlife including fish and insects can also experience kidney issues and die from sewage pollution.\n\nWater UK, the body which represents England's nine water and sewage companies, apologised on behalf of the industry for not \"acting quickly enough\".\n\nRuth Kelly, the organisation's chair, told BBC News: \"We're sorry about the upset and the anger from the fact that there have been overspills of untreated sewage onto beaches and into rivers over the past few years.\n\n\"We're sorry that we didn't act sooner, but we get it.\"\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nEnvironment Agency chairman Alan Lovell welcomed the companies' apology but said he wanted to \"see action and a clear plan for delivery\".\n\nThe companies said on Thursday they were ready to spend \u00a310bn raised from investors to tackle the problem - but admitted customers could see a \"modest\" bills rise as firms looked to recover the costs over time.\n\nWater regulator Ofwat said on Thursday it would review the commitment to assess what impact it could have on consumers before spending begins.\n\nThere are many ways that water companies can spend the money to reduce sewage spills including:\n\nBut the water companies have come under significant criticism for suggesting bills could be raised to pay for this investment whilst continuing to pay out profits to shareholders.\n\nDowning street has said that water companies should put \"consumers above profits\".\n\nThe prime minister's deputy official spokesman said the apology from water companies was welcome but acknowledged that more needed to be done.\n\n\"And we've been clear throughout that we don't want to see things disproportionately impacting customer bills, especially given we know that there are people up and down the country who are struggling with the cost of living, which is why we provided the help we have in that area.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how much bills could rise with the new investment as Ofwat will not make a decision until the end of 2024 on spending plans.\n\nMarine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) welcomed \"the long overdue apology\" but said the investment should not be paid for through higher bills.\n\n\"The UK public has already paid for environmental protection from sewage - but we're yet to see it. And whilst the water industry rakes it in, this investment pledged by Water UK must come out of water company profits, not from the bill payer,\" said Izzy Ross, campaigns manager at SAS.\n\nCommons Environmental Audit Committee chair, Conservative MP Philip Dunne, told the BBC he hoped Ofwat would approve the investment plan.\n\nLast year his committee warned the UK's rivers were a \"chemical cocktail\" of raw sewage, microplastics and slurry.\n\n\"The water and sewage sector is in listening mode and has provided a promising plan to tackle poor water quality and take vital steps to improve the country's ageing sewerage infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nJim McMahon MP, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said the government was partially to blame for the situation.\n\n\"Thirteen years of Tory government failure has left a broken system, capped by an appalling track record of inaction. The Conservatives are the problem not the solution,\" he said.\n\nThis sentiment was supported by Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey. \"The one apology missing here is from the environment secretary,\" he said. \"This Conservative government has been pathetic on stopping sewage discharges into rivers.\"\n\nThe Green Party called for water and sewage companies to be brought back into public ownership.\n\nSewage spills can cause algae blooms which starve fish and other organisms of oxygen\n\nWater UK said the companies also committed to cutting spills by up to 35% by 2030 and sharing real time data on how often sewage was being spilled into rivers and seas.\n\nBut this is not a new pledge, as the government announced last month the sharing of data would be a legal requirement for water companies by 2025.\n\nWater UK also said companies would reduce the number of sewage spills by up to 140,000, compared with 2020, when there were more than 400,000 spills.\n\nEnvironmental campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp) said that promise was \"meaningless\" unless the volume being spilled is also reduced. Currently, water companies are only required to monitor if a spill is happening but not how much is released.\n\nPeter Hammond, from Wasp, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"All they are promising to do is reduce the number of spills, we still don't know whether they are trickles or tsunamis of sewage going into the river[s]\".\n\nWater and sewage services in the UK are devolved and in Scotland and Northern Ireland are provided by government-run companies, in Wales it is not-for-profit. They have their own action plans to tackle sewage spills which are not included in Water UK's announcement.\n\nHave you been affected by sewage spills?

If love and compassion could make a person immortal, she would have lived forever.\n\n\"She had a pure heart and was greatly loved for her personality and qualities.\n\n\"She was the most incredible mother to Fatimah and Naeemah, two angels who deserved a beautiful childhood and a full life.\n\n\"Nottingham and the rest of the world have been denied potential future teachers, civil servants, doctors - who knows what they could have been?\n\n\"They lived a short but meaningful life, such was the joy and happiness they brought to us all.\"\n\nBarrow had claimed he did not realise anyone was inside the flat\n\nMrs Hydara's family thanked the Gambian community in the UK and internationally for the support it had offered them since the fatal fire.\n\nThey also thanked Nottinghamshire Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the jurors.\n\nBefore they died Mrs Hydara and her children had been planning to move to the US to be with her husband Aboubacarr Drammeh.\n\nDet Insp Kaz Smithson, who led the investigation, said: \"Jamie Barrow committed the most despicable crime anyone could ever commit.\n\n\"He destroyed a whole family and took away their dreams of a happy life together in America.\n\n\"Today, justice has been served for Fatoumatta, Fatimah and Naeemah and their family, all of whom have carried themselves with incredible dignity since the night of this truly awful crime.\n\n\"Barrow denied the killings were deliberate but, thankfully, my investigative team was able to provide overwhelming evidence that this tragic event was indeed murder.\n\n\"We saw through his lies and, thankfully, so did the jury.\"\n\nThe family had been planning a new life overseas\n\nAfter the hearing Nottinghamshire Police said Barrow's motive for starting the fire might never be known but jurors heard one theory was that he wanted to rehoused by local authorities.\n\nCh Insp Karl Thomas said: \"I acknowledge there are many members of the community who believe these murders were a hate crime.\n\n\"It's important to say that, following a very detailed and thorough investigation by a large team of detectives, the investigation team left no stone unturned to investigate the circumstances and presented the evidence to the jury to reach these verdicts.\"\n\nMrs Hydara's husband Aboubacarr Drammeh read a family statement outside court following the verdicts\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The decision is a \"victory for unborn children\", said Katie Daniel, Florida policy director of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nBut in a 4-3 vote, the justices also approved a November ballot initiative that, if approved, would overturn the six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.\n\nThe decisions have sharpened the glare of the political spotlight on the Sunshine State, and set up perhaps the highest stakes abortion fight since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.\n\nThe six-week ban in Florida - the country's third most populous state - may affect more women than any other statewide ban implemented since the repeal of Roe.\n\nJust over 84,000 women received abortions in Florida last year, state data says. According to pro-choice research group the Guttmacher Institute, that figure showed a 12% jump over 2020, which researchers attribute mostly to out-of-state patients.\n\nSome Florida lawmakers, many of whom voted for the six-week ban last year, called the law a compromise, adding that it includes exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, abnormalities and when the mother's life is in danger.\n\nBut pro-choice activists have warned that even with these exceptions, strict abortion bans can endanger women's health, pointing to cases involving pregnancy complications in states such as Texas.\n\nAnd, they add, Florida's six-week law is particularly restrictive, requiring patients seeking abortions to have two in-person doctor appointments with a 24-hour waiting period in between.\n\n\"At six weeks most women have no idea that they're even pregnant,\" said Anna Hochkammer, executive director of the pro-choice group Florida Women's Freedom Coalition. \"A mammoth health crisis is about to befall us.\"\n\nFlorida's new abortion landscape also has significant political consequences. The November referendum", "pathways to the World Cup as well.\n\n\"The obligations and pressures have increased with the upward trajectory of professionalisation but the conditions and wellbeing of players has either stayed the same or actually decreased,\" Dr Alex Culvin, Fifpro's head of research for women's football told the BBC's 100 Women.\n\nFor her, its crucial that the right care is offered to the more than half of players who reported either not receiving, or not being aware of, mental health support.\n\nFifpro says almost one in three players surveyed said they are not paid by their national team for these matches. More than half said they didn't get a pre-tournament medical examination.\n\n\"It is not an environment that supports players to be at their best all of the time,\" says Sarah Gregorius, Fifpro's director of strategic relations for women's football.\n\nWhen it comes to pre-tournament medicals, she says, \"the numbers on their own are quite shocking and dangerous\".\n\nShe wants to see all players offered one and anything less is \"completely unacceptable\".\n\nMany countries have a long history of men's professional football and experts say this established infrastructure is partly why medical care for male players is more consistent compared to women's football.\n\n\"Because of the limited number of [women's] professional clubs who offer professional standards... the need for women players to have these tests done at the international level is greater,\" says Dr Culvin.\n\nShe points to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) as an example of what can be achieved - its players reported a much higher likelihood of receiving adequate health checks compared to players at other confederation championships.\n\n\"Caf had made a real effort to give a medical and an ECG [electrocardiogram - to check heart rhythms] to all of the players... so when confederations make it a priority, the data can shift,\" she says.\n\nNearly all of those who took part in the Fifpro research said that pay and prize money needed to be improved.\n\nAlmost one third of those surveyed said they had to take unpaid leave from other employment to take part in qualifying rounds.\n\n\"Players have to make a choice between competing for their national team in international tournaments or maintaining their second job and another source of income. A choice players should not have to make,\" says Fifpro in its report.\n\nAs part of Fifa's recent commitment to minimum conditions for this year's Women's World Cup tournament - taking place in Australia and New Zealand - it promised a share of prize money for players.\n\nEach individual player from the squad of up to 23 players will be given an amount of money depending on their team's achievement in the competition, from $30,000 (\u00a323,476) for those exiting at the group stage, up to $270,000 (\u00a3211,286) for each player in the winning team.\n\nQualifying for the Women's World Cup has made Zambia pay attention to women's football, says Evarine Katongo\n\nThis year will be the first time a team from Zambia - men's or women's - will appear in a football World Cup competition. It has made everyone in the country pay attention to women's football, says Evarine Katongo, a midfielder on the qualifying team.\n\nShe thinks Fifa's promise is a step in the right direction for footballers who come from challenging backgrounds or low incomes.\n\n\"It really will make an impact, especially to the African players,\" she says. \"It will really help them to do good for their family and probably it will help them make ends meet.\"\n\nAlthough she sees women's football becoming more popular in Zambia, when it comes to pursuing her own dreams, Evarine says success lies abroad, where there is more money and opportunity.\n\n\"My dream for myself at the World Cup is to be scouted by another team,\" she says.\n\n\"I don't see myself playing for the local league in Zambia again after the World Cup.\"\n\nOne player who has achieved success with a bigger club is Colombian international Leicy Santos, who moved to Spain to play professionally for Atletico Madrid in 2019.\n\nEarlier in her career, she faced immense financial hardship in order to pursue her dream.\n\n\"I come from a very humble family,\" she says of her time growing up in rural Colombia.\n\nLeicy Santos will be playing in her second World Cup this year, after first appearing for Colombia in 2015\n\n\"Until I joined the Colombian national team in 2012, I didn't have any financial support. Then I started to earn a small amount of money every time I went to training, they [the national team] paid my travel expenses,\" she says.\n\n\"At that point I stopped asking my parents for money and rather helped them as much as I could, but what they [the national team] paid me wasn't much either.\"\n\nDespite being part of the national team, it still wasn't possible for her to make a living only from football, and Leicy says she cleaned houses with her mother to help contribute towards the family's income.\n\n\"The reality is that you don't have a constant support that allows you to make a living from football and focus only on the sport,\" she says.\n\nIn 2019, Atletico Madrid signed Leicy and that's when she noticed a huge change in her professional experience.\n\n\"I am in a club that offers me everything - training facilities, medical services, a salary,\" she says.\n\n\"I know that I am privileged; there are clubs that even in my same league here in Spain do not provide any of this and [the players] have a very bad time.\"\n\nOrganisers are hoping a record two billion people will watch the Women's World Cup this year, nearly double the 1.12 billion viewers for the 2019 tournament in France.\n\n\"I just think it's an incredible way to smash the stereotypes that have persisted,\" says Jennifer Cooper, UN Women's sport lead.\n\n\"It shows that women are capable. It provides role models and dreams for girls and... it normalises that men and women both play football.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Fifa, the six confederations and the national teams for Colombia and Zambia to make a statement but none were provided.\n\nA major blaze near Mudgee, New South Wales, has burned more than 2,000 hectares since Sunday\n\nDozens of bushfires burning across Australia's east coast could get worse as a severe heatwave continues, fire services have warned.\n\nAfter two years of rains and floods, a return to warmer conditions has sparked New South Wales state's worst fires since the 2019/2020 \"Black Summer\".\n\nA blaze 250km (155 miles) north-west of Sydney triggered the region's first emergency fire warning in two years.\n\nResidents in affected areas across New South Wales - Australia's most populous state - have been urged to evacuate, and there are reports of damage to some properties.\n\nTemperatures in some parts of the state also hit 40C (104F) on Monday, for the first time since January 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, 33 fires were still burning across the state, 10 of which were not under control, fire authorities said.\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service said strong winds had driven the fires' rapid spread.\n\n\"It's going to be another tough day for firefighters and potentially even into tomorrow before we get some reprieve,\" RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nAustralia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) also warned that dry thunderstorms were possible across eastern NSW, which could spark new fires.\n\nRFS Inspector Ben Shepherd told the BBC a number of other fires in western NSW were \"likely to be problematic\".\n\nThe hot and dry conditions are expected to last until Wednesday.\n\nEastern Australia has experienced three consecutive summers of La Ni\u00f1a conditions, with above-average rainfall causing widespread flooding.\n\nIn 2022, Sydney recorded its wettest year since records began.\n\nBut last week, the Bom said its models suggested La Ni\u00f1a was \"likely near its end\", with a return to neutral conditions or even the hot and dry El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, likely in the southern hemisphere's autumn.\n\nAt least 33 people and an estimated 3 billion animals and birds died in 2019-20 Black Summer fires, one of Australia's worst-ever natural disasters.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues", "70 years proved to be a sumptuous, seamless and often surreal ceremony.\n\nBefore 2,300 guests, King Charles and Queen Camilla went through the ancient rituals, with a twist of modern signals about diversity.\n\nBut it was also like a spectacularly lavish wedding, with friends, families and famous faces crowded into every corner of the church, playing with their phones, checking to see who else was there.\n\nAnd where else would international royalty, world leaders and 100 overseas heads of state get an opportunity to meet Ant and Dec?\n\nThe King is crowned in the 700-year-old Coronation chair\n\nThere were glamorous outfits and hats, splashes of military uniforms with epaulettes, plumes and swords, clerical robes and every shade and shape of national dress. The selfies on the way in were going to prove that they'd really been here.\n\nThere were traditional roles with baffling titles such as Bluemantle Pursuivant and Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and a number of men seemed to be entirely dressed in medieval flags.\n\nWalking down the nave when he arrived, the King seemed to be pausing to take it all in.\n\nWhat was he thinking, after all the decades that he'd been waiting for this day? Was he thinking about his mother, his own family, the responsibility?\n\nWhen the Archbishop of Canterbury appeared to give the crown a couple of twists on his head, the King might have been thinking less charitable thoughts.\n\nA guest in the Abbey takes a selfie with Ant and Dec\n\nAnd the only person who could have stolen the King's show was possibly Penny Mordaunt, the lord president of the council, who hovered around the high altar looking like a deity who had escaped from an ancient Greek urn.\n\nBut the King must have been delighted with the music, not least because he'd chosen it himself, like all of this elaborate ceremony. It was like a big work of art and he was its creator.\n\nAt close quarters in the abbey, the orchestra and choir were remarkable, the music welling up like a tidal wave of sound. It was bouncing off the stained glass windows.\n\nThe piece by William Byrd had all the aching melancholy and stillness that you suspect King Charles would really have enjoyed. Handel's Zadok the Priest, full of drama and anticipation, was a real spine-tingler.\n\nThere was also the most eclectic collection of people in the congregation. There were hundreds of charity workers, US First Lady Jill Biden, President Macron and rows of celebrities, such as Joanna Lumley, Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, and hello, it's Lionel Ritchie.\n\nMany of the guests had been inside the abbey for hours before it started, which meant some of the best-dressed queues ever seen for the toilets. I'd never really thought about the mechanics of such a visit for a peer in floor-length robes and ermine.\n\nIt was a lavish and colourful spectacle in the Abbey\n\nThere had been stories about MPs complaining about a lack of tickets for the Coronation. Part of the problem might be there are now so many ex-PMs to accommodate. Even Liz Truss got a seat.\n\nBoris Johnson arrived looking like his shirt collars were staging their own backbench rebellion.\n\nThe current PM, Rishi Sunak, had a speaking part, delivering the Bible lesson.\n\nFor those hoping to watch any body language between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William, there was nothing to see, as they may as well have been sitting a continent apart.\n\nHarry arrived looking relaxed and chatty, despite this being a huge transatlantic flying visit, and was seated a couple of rows behind Prince William, the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrince Harry was heading back to the US straight after the service\n\nThe older brother, who must have been thinking that one day he'll face his own Coronation, was more engaged in his own role in the ceremony.\n\nThere seemed to be glances exchanged too between the husband and wife at the centre of this event, who were maybe having the big public wedding they didn't have before.\n\nKing Charles now has his Queen Camilla beside him. It took them about half an hour to get to the Abbey in the morning, but their journey to this point has taken them decades.\n\nIt's impossible to go into Westminster Abbey without feeling the weight of history on every side. It seeps from every plaque and statue. Even the clothes had a story. The King was wearing a robe that had been his grandfather's and Catherine was wearing earrings that had been Diana's.\n\nMany guests might have been remembering being here at the late Queen's funeral, which eight months ago went out through the same doors as today's newly-crowned couple.\n\nThe King and Queen left the Abbey in the Gold State Coach\n\nSuch grand occasions, snapshots for the history books, are where the past, present and future overlap.\n\nWith the music soaring and the guests on their feet, the King and Queen left the Abbey to step inside the crown-on-wheels that is the Gold State Coach, with umbrellas up against the rain.\n\nThe carriage pulled away, past a sea of waving camera phones, and another era had begun.\n\nDonald Trump is accused of pressuring an employee to delete security footage at his Florida home, in new criminal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified files.\n\nThe latest indictment adds one count of wilful retention of defence information and two of obstruction, making 40 charges in total in this case.\n\nMr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has called the prosecutor \"deranged\".\n\nHe is fighting multiple legal cases as he runs for president again.\n\nIn a Friday morning interview, he reiterated that he would not end his 2024 campaign even if he is criminally convicted.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to earlier charges in the case, alongside his personal aide Walt Nauta, who also received two additional charges of obstruction on Thursday.\n\nThe property manager at the former US president's Mar-a-Lago estate, Carlos de Oliveira, has also now been indicted.\n\nThe revised charge-sheet outlines alleged efforts between Mr Nauta and Mr de Oliveira to obstruct the justice department's investigation.\n\nAccording to the court document, they conspired in an effort to delete surveillance video after the Department of Justice issued a subpoena demanding footage of the area where it said confidential documents were held.\n\nProsecutors claim Mr de Oliveira twice told Mar-a-Lago's director of information technology that \"the boss\" wanted the server deleted, in a conversation he said must remain between them.\n\nThe IT worker responded that he did not believe he had the authority to do so, according to the indictment.\n\nThe employee, who is not named or charged in the indictment, has been identified as Yuscil Taveras.\n\nThe charge-sheet also describes a scene in which Mr de Oliveira \"walked through the bushes\" into a property adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort to meet Mr Nauta.\n\nLater, the court filing adds, Mr Trump phoned Mr de Oliveira and promised him legal counsel at Mr Nauta's request.\n\nA lawyer for Mr de Oliveira has declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nThe updated indictment also says that Mr Trump knowingly discussed a top-secret document with biographers visiting Mar-a-Lago to interview him.\n\nThe paper Mr Trump allegedly revealed to the biographers contained possible plans to attack \"Country A\", which refers to Iran.\n\n\"Look what I found... Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this thing just came up. Look,\" Mr Trump allegedly said to one of his guests.\n\nThe indictment included images of files allegedly stored in a shower\n\nThe documents case is led by special prosecutor Jack Smith, who is also overseeing a separate investigation into alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Mr Trump's attorneys John Lauro and Todd Blanche met officials at Mr Smith's office in Washington DC.\n\nThe former president said on Thursday his lawyers had received no indication of timing of when charges may be filed in the case.\n\nIn an emailed statement, his presidential campaign dismissed the fresh charges as a \"way to salvage their illegal witch hunt\".\n\nCong", "\"specific socio-demographic factors, such as ethnicity and unemployment\".\n\nCraig Westwood, director of communications at the commission, said \"it is too soon to draw conclusions\", but added \"some of the emerging evidence is concerning\".\n\nNo cases of personation - where someone pretends to be another person, in order to vote - were reported during this year's elections. In 2022, there were 13 cases recorded by police, including seven at polling stations, none of which led to prosecutions.\n\nResearch published by the commission on Friday found 0.7% of voters were initially turned away from polling stations in May. Around two-thirds of these returned later in the day and were able to vote.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the rules were having a \"chilling effect on democracy\".\n\nBut Labour have stopped short of saying they would scrap the policy, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calling for a \"wide review\" into the impact of Voter ID.\n\n\"This is the first piece of evidence coming through, so we need to look at everything in the round,\" he said.\n\nLib Dem spokesperson Helen Morgan said the policy \"looks like a transparent attempt at voter suppression by Conservative ministers who are desperate to stop people from holding them to account\".\n\n\"It is an outrage that thousands of people were denied a voice at the local elections because of the Conservative Party's Voter ID rules,\" she added.\n\nThe government announced the voter ID move in 2021, arguing it would tackle voter fraud and boost public confidence in elections.\n\nPassports, driving licences and blue badges are among the IDs permitted. Only 25,000 of the 90,000 free Voter Authority Certificates applied for before May's election were used as a form of ID.\n\nThere have been only a handful of convictions for electoral fraud in recent years - but ministers argue a lack of evidence could be masking the true level.\n\nThey also point out that voter ID has been a requirement in Northern Ireland since 2003, as well as in many other European countries.\n\nOpposition parties voted against it, arguing it was unnecessary and would hit turnout among marginalised groups.\n\nConservative MP Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was in the Cabinet when the measure was introduced, recently said the voter ID policy had been an attempt at gerrymandering - fixing rules to gain electoral advantage.\n\nHe said the measure had come \"back to bite them,\" claiming his party's vote had been hit because older people, who were more likely to vote Tory, were also more likely to lack an accepted form of identity.\n\nBefore the election, 87% of people in England were aware that they needed to show photo ID to vote at a polling station, according to a survey carried on behalf of the commission. The polling excluded London, which did not hold local elections in May.\n\nMr Westwood said: \"The evidence suggests that the vast majority of voters were able to present an accepted form of ID at the May elections.\n\n\"But it also shows that some people were prevented from voting in polling stations due to the requirement, and significantly more did not attempt to because they lacked the required ID.\n\n\"Overall awareness was high and achieved in a matter of months, but we can see that people who lacked ID were less likely to know they needed to show it.\n\nThe commission plans to publish its full election report in September.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

That was my first animation job.\"\n\nGone are the days of using paper and pencil to draw; now Owain creates using a computer\n\nEven though he was happy in London and had no plans to move, in 2016 two huge moments changed Owain's life.\n\nJoe Brumm, an animator in Australia, emailed Owain asking if he would like to go over there to work on his idea for a cartoon.\n\nThen Owain met his partner, Kristen, an Australian.\n\nJoe's idea, about a cartoon family of dogs, was given the green light and a year later Owain found himself working on Bluey as the series' chief designer in Brisbane.\n\nOwain and Kristen now have a daughter called Nia\n\nBluey has since become a phenomenon. It has won awards galore in Australia and has become a firm favourite with children in countries including the UK.\n\nBut even Owain admits \"nobody knew how big the show was going to become\".\n\nHow does his work as designer and rigger fit in with the whole process of bringing the cartoon to life on-screen?\n\nBluey has become a sensation across the world\n\n\"My role is to take the props and the characters the art director designs and construct them using special software, ready for the animators,\" Owain explained.\n\n\"If the character needs to talk, walk, hold props, turn 360 degrees\u2026 we need to design everything, from the shape of the mouth to the shape of the hand, until you've created everything the character needs to do.\n\n\"You're like a mechanic building the inside. The lower part of the body needs to move the top of the head, and the top of the arm needs to be able to move the lower part, which then moves the hand. Then, the animators work to bring the characters to life.\n\n\"It's a big job because every character on Bluey has over 150 mouth shapes, over 200 hands, and 40 feet.\"\n\nEach episode lasts seven minutes, but every finished programme requires four months of work from start to finish.\n\nAs well as working on Bluey, Owain has also worked on other children's cartoons in Australia. But, he says it can be quite hard to get a job as a designer in the world of animation.\n\nOf course even though you need talent there is an element of luck and who you know.\n\n\"I was lucky, I did well in university, so they sent me to London for an industry night, and I met with a person who was working on the Mr Bean cartoon. And with luck, my final project looked like the style of Mr Bean, so I was asked to work on the series.\n\n\"Every job I've worked on since has been through people I know.\"\n\nOwain and the rest of the crew that work on the third series of Bluey\n\nOwain has now been in Australia for six years and has a young daughter Nia with Kristen.\n\nThe Bluey production team is waiting to see if there will be a fourth series of the cartoon.\n\nIn the meantime, Owain has set up an animation company with a co-worker and they are looking for new projects.\n\nBut he said he also wanted to work on something that reminds him of Wales.\n\n\"I've never done anything in the Welsh language,\" he said. \"I'm so far from home - my family are all back in Wales and I miss Wales so much.\n\n\"I try and read to Nia in Welsh so I want to draw Welsh-language books. I don't have to come up with the idea, I just want, 'designed by Owain Emanuel' on it.\n\n\"And a Welsh-language cartoon would be great. But one step at a time\u2026\"\n\nYou can watch Bluey on BBC iPlayer or the BBC CBeebies TV channel.\n\nUkraine and Russia have reported inflicting heavy losses as the battle for Bakhmut rages on.\n\nMoscow has been trying to take the eastern Ukrainian city for months in a grinding war of attrition.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few", "important for customers than during a cost of living crisis,\" the retailer said.\n\nCustomers were choosing more energy-efficient products because they were aware this was better for the environment too, it added.\n\nShares in the retailer dropped more than 7% after it said that it was wary about the prospects for consumer demand bouncing back.\n\nStruggling households have been hammered by rising prices over the past few years as food, energy and fuel costs have soared.\n\nTo battle inflation, the Bank of England has been raising interest rates - but this has been putting more pressure on people with big loans, such as mortgages.\n\nHowever, the pace of general price rises has not eased as much as had been hoped, leading to predictions of more interest rate rises.\n\nFor the Welsh for \"others safe\", the message incorrectly read \"eraill yn Vogel\"\n\nA translation blunder that saw a Slovenian ski resort mentioned in the Welsh version of the emergency alert test has been blamed on autocorrect.\n\nFor the Welsh for \"others safe\", the test message read \"eraill yn Vogel\" instead of \"eraill yn ddiogel\".\n\nVogel has no meaning in Welsh, as there is no letter V in the alphabet. But it is a ski resort and German for bird.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden insisted the \"essence of the message remained unchanged\".\n\nThe message appeared on the home screens of mobile phones and tablets at 15:00 BST, accompanied by a loud siren-like sound lasting about 10 seconds.\n\nHe told MPs: \"An online system made a small autocorrect, rendering one word in the Welsh test message incorrect.\"\n\nHe also said anyone travelling between Wales and England on Sunday would have received two alerts.\n\nThis, he added, would be addressed in a \"lessons learned\" exercise.\n\nMr Dowden has said one in five compatible mobiles did not get the alert, with the Three network having a problem supporting multiple messages, which meant some people did not get it.\n\nMr Dowden called the test successful, saying it was, \"the largest simultaneous public message in UK history\".\n\nHe said there were \"no security or public safety issues\" and no events were disrupted.\n\n\"The system is now fully operable,\" he said, adding that further tests were possible.\n\nColin Pitchfork was jailed for life for raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth\n\nThe Lord Chancellor has asked the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to allow child killer Colin Pitchfork to be released from prison.\n\nPitchfork was jailed for life for raping and strangling two teenage girls in Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986.\n\nLord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said it was \"absolutely vital\" dangerous offenders were kept behind bars.\n\nHe said there was an arguable case the board's decision was irrational.\n\nPitchfork became the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence.\n\nHe was jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 1988 for the murder of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.\n\nThis was later reduced to 28 years for good behaviour.\n\nDawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann were raped and murdered by Pitchfork\n\nThe 63-year-old was released from prison in 2021 but was arrested and sent back to prison two months later.\n\nHe was granted parole in June following a hearing held in private in April.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr Chalk said: \"My thoughts remain with the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, whose lives were changed forever by the heinous crimes of Colin Pitchfork.\n\n\"My number one priority is public protection and after careful assessment I have asked the Parole Board to reconsider their decision to release him.\n\n\"It is absolutely vital that every lawful step is taken to keep dangerous offenders behind bars.\"\n\nThe Lord Chancellor is a senior member of the cabinet and heads the Ministry of Justice.\n\nHis intervention comes after the Conservative MP for South Leicestershire Alberto Costa called for the parole decision to be challenged.\n\nMr Costa said: \"I am very grateful to the justice secretary for listening to me and my constituents by challenging the Parole Board's deeply disappointing decision.\n\n\"Like many, I was aghast at the recent decision.\n\n\"The Parole Board now has a further opportunity to get this decision right and to ensure that Colin Pitchfork stays in prison where he belongs\".\n\nAfter the decision was made public last month, a Parole Board spokesperson said: \"Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority, however our sole focus in law is risk, not punishment, and must be based on evidence.\n\n\"This case is eligible for reconsideration if any party thinks the decision is irrational or unfair.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

It was a passion for a cause: the duty to inform,\" he said.\n\nSoldin was killed after he was hit by rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, just west of Bakhmut, on 9 May, when a team of journalists came under attack while with a group of Ukrainian soldiers. The rest of the AFP team were unharmed.\n\nHe died \"with his camera in his hand\", his colleague Emmanuel Peuchot said.\n\nAt the time, Bakhmut had been the epicentre of fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces for several months.\n\nFrance's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has opened a war crimes investigation into his death.\n\nSoldin, born in Bosnia but a French national, was part of the first AFP team to go to Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February last year and had lived there since September.\n\nAs an infant, he fled fighting in Bosnia with his family, taking a humanitarian flight to France in April 1992, according to AFP.\n\nThe agency's Europe director, Christine Buhagiar, remembered Soldin as \"enthusiastic, energetic and brave\", and said he had been \"totally devoted to his craft\".\n\nThe Legion of Honour is France's top accolade for an elite group of people who distinguish themselves through civilian or military valour.\n\nIt was introduced by Napoleon Bonaparte, then first consul of the French Republic, in 1802.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nConservative MP Bob Stewart has been charged with racially abusing a man he allegedly told to \"go back to Bahrain\".\n\nThe Beckenham MP faces two public order charges relating to an incident outside an event hosted by the Bahraini embassy.\n\nIt occurred after a campaigner pressed him on his links to the country outside the event in December last year.\n\nMr Stewart will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 5 July.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said Mr Stewart faced one charge of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, where the offence was racially aggravated.\n\nHe also faces an alternative charge of threatening behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm", "agency staff because of recruitment and retention issues.\n\n\"While waiting times to see a doctor had improved since May, the flow of patients through the department was still extremely challenging.\n\n\"Waits to see a specialty doctor varied and inspectors found on some occasions those doctors refused to review patients waiting in the ED, leading to further delays.\"\n\nHIW said it would continue to monitor the response of the health board very closely.\n\nThe health board has apologised to patients who may not have received \"the level of care they deserved\".\n\nDr Nick Lyons, executive medical director and interim deputy chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr health board, noted improvements highlighted by inspectors but acknowledged \"we still have some way to go\" to improve care for all patients.\"\n\n\"It is true staff within the ED at Glan Clwyd Hospital have been under enormous strain for the past three years and this has increased since restrictions eased,\" he said.\n\n\"Attempts to attract permanent members of staff to support the ED's work continues and another recruitment open day is planned within the next few weeks.\n\n\"However, the fragility in staffing and the volume of acutely unwell people we receive each day means we remain a service requiring significant improvement.\n\n\"The vast majority of our colleagues are a credit to our organisation and we value their hard work and professionalism. We will continue to strive to make sure they feel supported by colleagues in other specialties and their hospital management teams.\"\n\nDr Lyons said he noted \"with pride\" inspectors' comments about the commitment of staff, and the satisfaction of the \"majority of patients\" with their care.\n\nHe added: \"Despite the issues raised in the report inspectors acknowledged progress has been made but we know this needs to accelerate.\n\n\"Our colleagues within ED, and in other areas of the hospital, are fully focused on driving this change forward and we are pleased to see the proportion of patients moving through the department within four hours continuing to rise.\"\n\nFollowing publication of the inspection report, Health Minister Eluned Morgan agreed there were \"still very, very serious problems\" at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and its emergency department \"in particular\".\n\nEluned Morgan: \"There seems to be a specific problem with the emergency department in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd\"\n\nAnswering questions in the Welsh Parliament, the minister said there had been \"serious discussions\" with Dr Lyons \"to ask about what exactly has been put in place\" to improve the situation.\n\n\"There seems to be a specific problem here with the emergency department in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got to encourage\" the department to learn from the other emergency departments within Betsi Cadwaladr health board that are \"working better\", the minister said.\n\nThere had been \"some encouraging improvements after the previous inspection\" but it was \"very disappointing that many of the issues have still not been fully resolved\".\n\nMs Morgan was answering questions from members including Vale of Clwyd Conservative MS Gareth Davies, who later urged Ms Morgan to \"get a grip on the situation\" and \"stop passing the buck\".\n\n\"Patients, along with the people of North Wales, deserve better,\" he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRescue efforts are under way in Mississippi and Alabama after a tornado tore through the two states on Friday night killing 26 people, including a baby and her father.\n\nEmergency services will have to dig through the debris left behind by the tornado, which flattened one town and obliterated homes and businesses.\n\nA state of emergency was declared in Mississippi on Sunday.\n\nAs Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff arrived in Mississippi to tour the damage, senator Roger Wicker tweeted: \"Today recovery efforts across our state began in earnest\".\n\nFriday's tornado has been classified as \"violent\" and given a preliminary EF-4 rating - the second-highest rating possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for large sections of both Alabama and Georgia for Sunday, ending at 13:00 ET (18:00 BST).\n\nIn Rolling Fork, crushed cars, bricks and glass litter the streets - the town has been almost entirely wiped out.\n\nOne resident told the BBC he was lucky to survive after seeking shelter in his bath tub.\n\nApproaching the neighbourhood in western Sharkey County, there is little indication of anything unusual.\n\nThe lush farmland that surrounds it is completely untouched, the trees aren't even bent out of shape by wind.\n\nThen, suddenly, you see the houses that were in the tornado's path.\n\nThey have been totally obliterated.\n\nThe tornado seen near the town of Rolling Fork\n\nIn this rural town of only 2,000 people, where one fifth of residents live below the poverty line, dozens of buildings have been flattened by the fury of the tornado.\n\nHomes where family and friends had gathered less than 24 hours before, ready for the weekend, have been reduced to rubble.\n\nTimber frames have been snapped into pieces. There are upturned washing machines, but it is impossible to identify anything that might have been a kitchen.\n\nAmongst the rubble, there are vehicles that have been tossed around. There is the occasional children's toy and other signs of the lives that were lived here just hours earlier.\n\nOne Rolling Fork local tries to salvage items from a car\n\nThe tornado hit in the middle of the night - people had been sleeping and had not heard the alerts. For many the first indication that something terrible was happening was the noise.\n\nFrancisco McKnight told the BBC it was a miracle that he is alive. The only warning he had was the sound, he said - he had never heard anything like the noise of the wind on Friday night and never wants to again.\n\nHe took one look outside and then ran into his bathroom and got into the bath tub. He said that was what saved him.\n\nThe only part of his home that is still standing are parts of two of the bathroom walls.\n\nThe tornado lasted just five to 10 minutes he said, and he sat in the tub as the rest of his home was ripped away. For now, he is staying in one of the shelters that have been set up in the area.\n\nHe does not know what he will do next, but he says somehow he will rebuild his life.\n\nMississippi state governor Tate Reeves visited Silver City and Winona on Saturday to meet affected residents who had been hit by the tornado's fury.\n\nSharing an update on Twitter, Mr Reeves described the situation as a \"tragedy\", writing: \"We are blessed with brave, capable responders and loving neighbours. Please continue to pray.\"\n\nMr Reeves requested an expedited disaster declaration for the region and said: \"We're going to fight like hell to make sure that we get as many resources to this area as possible.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But it is a very heavy substance, 1.7 times denser than lead, and it is used to harden rounds so that they can penetrate armour and steel.\n\nWhen a weapon made with a depleted uranium tip or core strikes a solid object, like the side of a tank, it goes straight through it and then erupts in a burning cloud of vapour.\n\nThe vapour settles as dust, which is poisonous and also weakly radioactive.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sending depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine would mean the UK was \"ready to violate international humanitarian law as in 1999 in Yugoslavia\".\n\n\"There is no doubt this will end badly for London,\" Mr Lavrov added.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the US would not be sending any munitions with depleted uranium to Ukraine.\n\nShells with depleted uranium were used in Iraq and the Balkans, where some claim it was linked to birth defects.\n\nA 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report said depleted uranium was an environmental concern in Ukraine.\n\n\"Depleted uranium and toxic substances in common explosives can cause skin irritation, kidney failure and increase the risks of cancer,\" it said.\n\n\"The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,\" it added.\n\nA scene from \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\"\n\nA new Winnie the Pooh horror movie will not be released in Hong Kong and Macau, its distributor has said.\n\nVII Pillars Entertainment apologised for the \"disappointment and inconvenience\" to viewers in the Chinese special administrative regions.\n\nThe film was released in the US in February and across the UK in March.\n\nReferences to the original, family-friendly version of Winnie the Pooh have been used to protest against President Xi Jinping in recent years.\n\nThe meme began after an image showing China's President Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013.\n\nCensors in China have since clamped down on references to AA Milne's character, and the 2018 Christopher Robin film was banned in the country.\n\nThis meme showing Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama began circulating in 2013\n\nHong Kong's Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration denied the film had been censored, saying it had issued a certificate of approval for the horror movie.\n\nThe office told Reuters it would not comment on commercial decisions made about the movie.\n\nThe film's director Rhys Frake-Waterfield told Reuters: \"The cinemas agreed to show it, then all independently come to the same decision overnight.

known as self-identification - instead.\n\nThe government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.\n\nLabour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\n\nSir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to \"introduce self-declaration\" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an \"important part\" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.\n\n\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.\n\nShe added that Labour wanted to avoid the \"mistakes\" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.\n\nScottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a \"cavalier approach\", she added.\n\nHowever, she added the current requirement to apply to an \"anonymous\" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it \"demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice\".\n\nInstead, she said it \"should be enough\" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.\n\nThe LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a \"huge step forward\" for trans people over the current government stance.\n\nBut it added the party was \"signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election\".\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to \"externally verify\" someone's acquired gender.\n\nRosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the \"core thing\" demanded by women's groups.\n\nMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges and prisons.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she called for more clarity on the party's position ahead", "the meeting, Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said this \"process has come to the end of the road\".\n\nMs O'Neill added she didn't share the secretary of state's \"overly optimistic assessment\" that a Stormont executive would return in the autumn.\n\nMichelle O'Neill said the DUP needed to get over internal party wrangling and put people first\n\nLast week Chris Heaton-Harris said he was \"hopeful\" about the return and believed a resolution was \"getting much closer\".\n\n\"I don't think there is any evidence to back that up,\" Ms O'Neill said.\n\n\"I hope that changes but I don't think anyone who was sitting in that meeting today is under any allusions that anything has changed in terms of the DUP's and the British government's game of chicken.\"\n\nStephen Farry described Thursday's meeting with Ms Brady as a \"stock take exercise\", and said discussions had gone as far as they could.\n\nThe Alliance deputy leader said the current situation was \"stalemate\", with no progress over the past few weeks.\n\nMr Farry said he was deeply worried about the future of Northern Ireland and believed excuses were being made for parties to stay out of government.\n\nThe power-sharing government at Stormont collapsed in February 2022\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said: \"I don't think it's about getting a bigger stick to beat the DUP with; I don't think that's going to work.\"\n\nHe stressed that pressure was already on the DUP to return to the executive and he hoped Mr Heaton-Harris would assist in the restoration of Stormont.\n\nMr Beattie said he remained optimistic about a return of the executive by the autumn.\n\nThe SDLP was not at the talks as it has confirmed it will form the official opposition.\n\nIt feels like a process which has now passed its best before date.\n\nIt served a purpose in keeping the parties engaged with civil servants in the absence of Stormont.\n\nIt also allowed preparations to be put in place for the executive's return in the face of mounting budget pressures.\n\nBut with no hint of when or if Stormont might return, these talks have \"run out of steam\", to quote one party source.\n\nWith no best before date set for the talks between the DUP and the government, the political drift is likely to continue for some time.\n\nJayne Brady, who was appointed head of the NI Civil Service in June 2021, met political leaders on Thursday morning\n\nMs Brady has previously warned that even if ministers are to return to an executive this year, an overspend of this year's budget was \"now unavoidable\".\n\nMs Brady outlined her position in a letter to Mr Heaton-Harris earlier this month.\n\nShe said Stormont departments have \"reached the limit\" of what they can do to manage budget pressures this year and the remaining gap did not stem from an \"unwillingness\" to act, but from a legal position.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been evacuated unharmed from a public event after what appeared to be a smoke bomb was thrown at him.\n\nA man was detained at the scene in Wakayama, where Mr Kishida had been due to give a speech, local media reported.\n\nA witness said they saw a person throwing something, followed by smoke, while another said they heard a big bang.

It has seen a resurgence after Moscow's full-scale invasion launched last year.\n\nIn the tribute video posted online, Ukrainian athletes representing several sports appear one-by-one saying \"Glory to the Heroes!\"\n\nIt comes after a passionate call by President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: 'Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!'\" he said earlier this week.\n\nArsenal's Oleksandr Zinchenko and Taras Stepanenko, who plays for Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk feature in the video. Legendary former player and now coach Serhiy Rebrov is also shown.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's boxing heavyweight world champion, Oleksandr Usyk, recorded a video of himself reciting a poem dedicated to the shot soldier, whose identity remains unclear.\n\n\"Glory to Ukraine! - for these words you got a bullet,\" he reads. \"You're no more - but memory is eternal of you, fighter\".\n\nThe graphic video first emerged on social media on Monday.\n\nIn the footage, one of the shooters - believed to be a Russian soldier - is heard saying \"die\" and using an expletive after the POW is shot dead with automatic weapons.\n\nA screenshot from the video purportedly showing the Ukrainian prisoner of war before he was shot dead\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine's military named the soldier as Tymofiy Shadura, citing preliminary information.\n\nHowever, there is some doubt over his identity, with one well-known Ukrainian journalist naming him as somebody else.\n\nThe alleged killer or killers - who are not seen in the clip - have not been identified.\n\nThe BBC has not verified where and when the footage was made, or how the soldier was captured.\n\nUkraine's authorities have said the killing is \"another proof this war is genocidal\" and launched a criminal investigation, vowing to hunt down the perpetrators.\n\nRussia has not publicly commented on the video.\n\nKyiv and its Western allies have accused Russian troops of committing mass war crimes -", "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as harmful to world trade.\n\nThe law includes $370bn (\u00a3297bn) to boost green technology in the US.\n\nIn a drive to cut carbon emissions, billions in tax credits and subsidies has been allocated to speed up the production of solar panels and wind turbines, and encourage the up-take of electric cars.\n\nThe European Union has described the law as anti-competitive, while earlier this year, Energy Secretary Grant Shapps said the package was \"dangerous because it could slip into protectionism\".\n\nIt is expected to be one subject of discussion when Mr Sunak meets Mr Biden for the fourth time this year, for talks at the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman suggested Mr Sunak would also talk about boosting green tech, the war in Ukraine, and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nDowning Street said the prime minister would seek to boost economic security, bringing it into line with the level of UK-US co-operation on defence.\n\nMr Sunak began the formal events of the US trip on Wednesday by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nPersonnel from the US army, navy, marines, air force and coastguard formed a guard of honour.\n\nThe ceremony comes ahead of meetings with senior US politicians and business leaders, as well as the president.\n\nTensions over the global implications of Mr Biden's economic package have been building ahead of the visit, Mr Sunak's first official trip to Washington DC as prime minister.\n\nThe UK government has said it had no plans to emulate the scale of the US plans, prompting accusations from Labour that the UK could fall behind in a global race to attract future industries.\n\nMr Sunak's visit was made the day after the 79th anniversary of D-Day\n\nDuring his flight to Washington, reporters asked Mr Sunak if there was anything Mr Biden could do to ease the economic impacts of his package on the UK.\n\n\"It's something that he [President Biden] and I have discussed in the past and you'd expect us to continue discussing it,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\nWhen asked whether Mr Sunak accepted President Biden's argument that a resilient economy sometimes required a protectionist approach to key sectors, the prime minister referenced a joint statement issued by the G7 at the end of its latest summit in Japan.\n\nThe statement, he said, \"makes it very clear that G7 countries don't believe in protectionism as the answer to this challenge and also don't believe in in subsidy races that are zero sum\".\n\nThere have been reports his trip could see the two sides unveil a critical minerals pact that would allow British carmakers that export electric vehicles to the US to benefit from some of the tax credits offered to American firms.\n\nThe US signed such a deal with Japan earlier this year, and has entered into talks with the EU.\n\nHowever, one area where progress has stalled is over a wider UK-US free trade deal, where President Biden has put talks on ice, leaving the UK to deepen trade ties through less comprehensive mini-deals with around 20 states.\n\nAnother area where Mr Sunak hopes to hold discussions is the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI), where Mr Sunak is seeking to carve out a role for the UK as a global player.\n\nThe prime minister is hosting a global summit on AI regulation in the autumn, and has reportedly expressed an interest in the UK hosting any new international regulator for the emerging technology.\n\nHowever, the extent to which the UK will be able to shape new global rules outside the EU is unclear, with the UK now shut out of key gatherings between European and American regulators such as the Tech and Trade Council (TTC).\n\nThe two leaders will also discuss the war in Ukraine, which is expected to enter a decisive period soon, with signs a long-awaited counter-offensive from Ukrainian forces may have begun.\n\nIt comes after Ukraine blamed Russia for the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in Russian-held Ukraine, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people. Moscow has denied destroying the dam, instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the plane to the US, Mr Sunak said it was \"too soon\" to make a \"definitive judgement\" on whether Russia was behind the attack.\n\nBut he said if Russia were found to be responsible, it would \"demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: \"We feel so excited, we feel so happy\"\n\nA group of Ugandan children is on the verge of glory after reaching the final of hit UK talent show Britain's Got Talent, where they have won over the judges and the public with their dazzling dance moves and bubbly personalities.\n\nThey have already made history after becoming the first act to be given a \"golden buzzer\" by one of the judges before they had even finished their performance. This sent them straight through to Wednesday's semi-final, where they received most public votes, meaning they are now among the 10 acts taking part in Sunday's final.\n\nThe group of six children aged between six and 13 all come from impoverished backgrounds in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where they were taken in and cared for by their guardian-turned manager Dauda Kavuma.\n\nHe told the BBC that he hopes their success can encourage other children living in similar circumstances.\n\n\"We feel so happy to keep doing this and to bring hope to all the children around the world who are in the ghetto, who are disadvantaged, who are less privileged - that they can make it in life.\"\n\nWhile they are winning over a new audience in the UK, the Ghetto Kids are already a global internet sensation and performed at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBut one of the group, Priscilla Zawedde, 13, told the BBC that winning the TV show - and the \u00a3250,000 ($313,000) prize money - would mean \"a bigger house for everyone\".\n\nSome 30 children currently share a five-bedroom house in Kampala, where they are looked after by Kavuma.\n\nHe set up the Inspire Ghetto Kids Foundation in 2007 to care for street children in the Kampala neighbourhood of Makindye and told the AFP news agency that having a bigger house would be a \"dream\" as the children would have more space.\n\nThey currently rely on donations from well-wishers, earnings from their social media posts as well as fees for live performances.\n\nKavuma also started life on the street before he was given a chance by a man who spotted him playing football and asked him if he wanted to go to school.\n\n\"He let me join his team and helped me pay my school fees. He was someone who helped me without knowing me. So from that day, I promised myself that when I grow up I'd hope to help a child one day,\" Kavuma told the BBC.\n\nBut he then switched to music, which he is now using to transform the lives of others.\n\n\"Most people thought street kids... have no value in society but I thought otherwise,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I use music, dance and drama to transform the underprivileged in the ghettos?'\" he says.\n\nAkram Muyana, 13, told the BBC that dancing had always been his way of escaping reality after his father died.\n\n\"Whenever I dance, I feel so happy, and my stress goes away. I started going to churches to dance to get money to give my mother for her to buy me clothes and food.\"\n\nThis is the second generation of Kavuma's Ghetto Kids to have found global stardom - the first generation was discovered dancing to Ugandan singer Eddy Kenzo's \"Sitya Loss\" and went on to have millions of YouTube views.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi recorded his message from his hospital room following a serious illness\n\nItaly's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has told supporters he's ready to go back to work after a month in hospital.\n\nThe 86-year-old, who is suffering from leukaemia, was rushed into intensive care with a related lung infection but his condition has since stabilised.\n\nThere has been no word on when he might leave hospital.\n\nIn a video address from his room, Mr Berlusconi thanked his Forza Italia party members for", "s holy book was destroyed, stoking diplomatic tensions with several Muslim-majority nations.\n\nIn its statement, Denmark's foreign ministry said it wants to explore intervening in some protests where \"other countries, cultures, and religions are being insulted, and where this could have significant negative consequences for Denmark\" - including security concerns.\n\nBut the Danish government emphasised free speech was a fundamental value and any change must be done \"within the framework of the constitutionally protected freedom of expression and in a manner that does not change the fact that freedom of expression in Denmark has very broad scope\".\n\nThe statement also specifically acknowledged the impact these controversial protests have had on Denmark's international reputation, repeating the government's earlier condemnation of burning religious texts.\n\nThese protests have reached a level where Denmark \"is being viewed as a country that facilitates insult and denigration of the cultures, religions, and traditions of other countries\" in many parts of the world, it added.\n\nIn a separate statement, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said a similar process was already underway and confirmed he had been in close contact with his Danish counterpart Mette Frederiksen.\n\n\"We have also started to analyse the legal situation already... in order to consider measures to strengthen our national security and the security of Swedes in Sweden and around the world,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nBoth statements followed several high-profile incidents where the Quran was burned or stamped on in recent weeks.\n\nIn June, an Iraqi Christian refugee living in Sweden, burned a copy of the religious text outside Stockholm's central mosque.\n\nThe man was then given permission to destroy a Quran for a second time last week, which led to Sweden evacuating its embassy staff from Baghdad after the building was stormed and set fire to by protesters\n\nFollowing this, last week two Danish far-right activists stamped on a Quran and set it alight in a tin foil tray next to an Iraqi flag on the ground outside Iraq's embassy in Copenhagen.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAn extra 5,000 hospital beds will be available this winter to help the NHS in England to cope, health bosses say.\n\nIt will mean nearly 100,000 permanent beds accessible at the busiest time of the year - a 5% rise on current levels.\n\nNHS England is also promising quicker discharge arrangements to get patients out of hospital when they are medically-fit to leave.\n\nThis will be achieved through the rollout of what have been dubbed \"care traffic control centres\".\n\nThese centres bring together the NHS, community, housing and charity teams to help co-ordinate support for those patients who need help once they leave hospital.\n\nThe idea is that plans for a prompt and efficient discharge can be started shortly after patients are admitted to hospital, thanks to better co-ordination among teams over follow-up care.\n\nLast winter, one-in-eight beds were taken by patients who were ready to be released, but could not be discharged because of a lack of available support.\n\nMany departments already use this approach, but NHS England has requested all areas have joint teams in place for winter.\n\nHospitals will also be provided with financial incentives to improve performance, such as keeping A&E waiting times to four hours or less.\n\nThe details have yet to be finalised, but it is thought likely it will include extra money for the 2024-2025 financial year for those hospitals that exceed expectations over the winter period.\n\nAlongside these measures there will be at least 10,000 'virtual' hospital beds open by autumn. Under such an arrangement, doctors provide remote monitoring of patients in their home, who would otherwise have to be admitted to hospital.\n\nThey have been used in recent years for patients with conditions such as respiratory infections and heart problems.\n\nThere will also be the option for hospitals to open emergency escalation beds if needed, NHS England said.\n\nSarah-Jane Marsh, from NHS England, said the measures would help the service increase its \"resilience\" during the busy winter months.\n\nMatthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation - which represents hospitals - said the measures were based on \"sound evidence\", but questioned whether there will be sufficient funding and staff to make the plan work. One-in-10 nurse posts are currently vacant.\n\nAdam Price took over as party leader in autumn 2018\n\nAdam Price said Plaid Cymru's \"time has come\" when he took over as leader five years ago.\n\nHis victory was not unexpected - with his imposing presence and strong oratory skills, Mr Price had long been regarded as a future leader.\n\nBut he departs after a report heavily criticised the workplace culture that existed in his party, alleging harassment, bullying and misogyny.\n\nA miner's son from the Amman Valley, Adam Price's politics were shaped by the long miners' strike of the mid-1980s.\n\nHe became an MP in 2001, representing Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, and made his mark in Westminster by leading an unsuccessful attempt to impeach the then prime minister, Tony Blair, over claims that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMr Price stood down as an MP in 2010 before going to study at the prestigious Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the US.\n\nIn 2016 he returned to frontline politics - this time in Cardiff Bay, still representing his home constituency.\n\nOne campaign leaflet that year famously described him as an \"X-factor politician\" and the \"mab darogan\" (the son of prophecy) - a figure from Welsh mythology who it is said will redeem Wales in its hour of need.\n\nAdam Price and other party leaders meeting the Prince of Wales at the Senedd last year\n\nTwo years later he ousted Leanne Wood and became the first openly gay leader of a Welsh political party.\n\nMr Price described the decision to challenge one of his \"oldest friends in politics\" as \"the most difficult thing I've had to wrestle with in my political life\".\n\nMs Wood would later tell the BBC that the move led to the collapse of their friendship.\n\nIn a departure from his predecessor's approach, Mr Price put the notoriously tricky subject of independence at the heart of his political plan, pledging to hold a referendum on the issue by 2030.\n\nBut at the snap general election of December 2019 the party found itself squeezed out of the Brexit-dominated debate, and though Plaid held on to its four seats in Westminster, its share of the vote fell back and it came a disappointing third in its main target seat of Ynys M\u00f4n.\n\nLabour First Minister Mark Drakeford and Adam Price signed a co-operation deal in late 2021\n\nAnd so to the 2021 Senedd election, where independence would be front and centre of the party's campaign.\n\nAhead of the vote, Mr Price said that he would count anything less than becoming first minister as a \"failure\", and he ruled out working with the Conservatives and joining a coalition with Labour as a junior partner.\n\nBut the party slipped back into third place, losing its grip on the Rhondda seat held by Ms Wood, as it struggled to compete with the favourable response towards the Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford's leadership during the pandemic.\n\nMonths later, and with Mr Drakeford having fallen just short of a majority in the Senedd, Mr Price formed a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government.\n\nThis was to be a new kind of deal, and one which would allow Plaid Cymru to push through some of its key policies, including Senedd expansion, the extension of free school meals, and free childcare for two year-olds.\n\nAnd that's why in the run-up to last May's Welsh local elections Mr Price - by now a father of two young children - was able to claim his party was \"making a difference\", and had \"snatched a moral victory from the mawing jaws of defeat\".\n\nBy the end of the year the party was engulfed by claims of a toxic culture within Plaid and criticism of the leadership's handling of the situation.\n\nThat culminated in a report by Nerys Evans which said the party had tolerated \"too many instances of bad behaviour\".\n\nMr Price initially insisted he would remain in post, arguing that quitting would be \"ab", "ation in the voices of those working on this. There is talk of people sleeping on sofas in between long stints in the Foreign Office's Crisis Centre.\n\nSources tell me there is the capacity to increase the frequency of flights out of Khartoum, if needs be. There is also the option of taking people out by ship from Port Sudan. But the focus is on those flights, for now.\n\nContingency planning is under way for what to do when the ceasefire ends.\n\nAll this, as the government faces criticism from some that they have been too slow.\n\nSome of those flown out of Sudan have expressed gratitude at being rescued in their first sentence, and criticism at its lack of pace in their second.\n\nAnd there have been comparisons with how other countries have managed things.\n\nFrance, for instance, collected some of its people who wanted to leave, rather than asking them to make their own way to the airfield. One of their soldiers was seriously injured in the process.\n\nUK Special Forces were used to extract British diplomats. But the government argues it would be hugely dangerous to provide what would amount to an armed taxi service to take people to the airport, as it would risk drawing the UK into the conflict.\n\nAnd the numbers of citizens it is attempting to help is far greater than other comparable countries.\n\nForeign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK can not guarantee how many more flights will depart Sudan when the ceasefire ends\n\nIncidentally, as my colleague, the BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill, has reported, there has been something of a spat between the German government and the UK government, with Berlin accusing London of delaying the evacuation of its own citizens by landing in Sudan without permission at the weekend.\n\nThere is private shock here that Germany went public with this and a desire not to be drawn into a diplomatic tit for tat over it. The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are denying the allegation.\n\nIt is worth mentioning too that there is not a domestic political row here at Westminster about how the government is handling things.\n\nPrivately some Labour figures think it has been too slow. But they are not leaping to criticise ministers - perhaps conscious any critique would, by extension, be seen as undermining the armed forces, diplomats and others doing all they can in very difficult circumstances.\n\nThe political argument may, of course, change, as that race against time, circumstances and numbers continues with the prospect it gets considerably more difficult.\n\nThe film's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (\u00a3293m)\n\n'Barbenheimer' fever took hold in the UK as Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig's Barbie took \u00a330m on their opening box office weekend.\n\nAccording to the UK Cinema Association, that makes it the most successful weekend for UK cinema-going since 2019.\n\nThat year, Disney blockbuster Avengers: Endgame opened with takings of \u00a343.7m.\n\nThe Vue cinema chain said this weekend marked the second biggest in its history by admissions.\n\nBarbie is now on track to become the biggest film released so far this year, ahead of Super Mario Bros.\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the weekend's UK box office figures will be published later on Monday.\n\nBarbie's marketing campaign has been huge - and hugely successful - with debut takings worldwide of $337m (\u00a3293m).\n\nUS and Canada takings were enough to make it the biggest opener of 2023 so far in that region.\n\nThe film took an estimated $155m (\u00a3120m) according to distributor Warner Bros, while Oppenheimer made $93.7m (\u00a372m), Universal Pictures said.\n\nThe North American box office figure broke the opening weekend record for a female director, easily overtaking the $103.3m opening of Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman.\n\nBoth films have been a welcome relief for cinemas who are battling against the juggernaut of streaming.\n\nOppenheimer's plot is centred on the development of the first atomic bomb, starring Cillian Murphy and directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nBarbie tells a coming-of-age story of the children's character where she explores her identity and encourages friend Ken to establish individuality.\n\nAccording to Billboard, film polling service PostTrak reported that women made up 65% of the Barbie audience, while 40% of ticket-buyers were under the age of 25.\n\nIt wasn't all plain sailing for Barbie, however. In China, the world's second biggest movie market, the film opened in fifth place.\n\nIndian cinemagoers were in for a surprise at one screening of Nolan's film Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy\n\nIt took just $8.2 million in its opening three days, according to data from consultancy firm Artisan Gateway, although it's not unusual for Chinese audiences to favour homegrown cinema over Hollywood and some analysts considered that hitting the $8m mark was above expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian cinemagoers were in for a surprise at one screening of Nolan's film, which was reportedly accompanied by Barbie subtitles.\n\n\"Friend of my cousin posted on insta that a cinema played Oppenheimer with Barbie subtitles,\" wrote Twitter user Sapun.\n\nBarbie's release was delayed in Pakistan's Punjab province on Friday over \"objectionable content\", officials said.\n\nOppenheimer director Christopher Nolan's interview with BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall is on the BBC iPlayer for 11 months.\n\nIn the Iranian capital, Tehran, protesters have taken to the streets to condemn the strike on their consulate in Damascus.\n\n\"We know that this act is done out of desperation and the regime [Israeli government] is in a serious predicament and is caught in an internal crisis and the war in Gaza,\" said demonstrator Mohammad Razavi to Reuters news agency.\n\n\"It is natural that, in line with the crisis-solving strategy, it tries to transfer the crisis from the inside to the outside to free itself a little, so this rude action can make it easier for them.\n\nQuote Message: We must have a serious answer to this action, like the answer we gave during the assassination of General Soleimani and this answer must reach the whole world. from Mohammad Razavi We must have a serious answer to this action, like the answer we gave during the assassination of General Soleimani and this answer must reach the whole world.\n\nAnother protester, a woman called Kosar Adhami, said: \"The embassy is considered part of a country's territory.

We now need to come together - fans, players and staff - and show the poise, quality and fight to secure our position as a Premier League club.\"\n\nThere have now been 12 managerial departures in the Premier League this season, and of the bottom nine teams in the league, only West Ham and Nottingham Forest have not made a change.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 5 Live, former Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage said: \"Brendan has", "noon.\n\nMore than 71% of the eligible 5,000 junior doctors voted, with 97% in favour of industrial action. A strike would impact planned operations, clinics and GP appointments.\n\nJunior doctors - fully-qualified medics who are not specialty staff doctors, consultants or GPs - make up 44% of the doctors in the NHS in Scotland.\n\nThe union said previous pay awards for junior doctors in Scotland had delivered real-terms pay cuts of 23.5% since 2008.\n\nIt added that, with rises in inflation, this year's 4.5% uplift was \"again being outstripped and the position on pay erosion will be worse by the end of the year\".\n\nThe BMA has asked for a 23.5% increase on top of inflation, arguing that it is needed to make up for 15 years of \"pay erosion\".\n\nThe union said it would begin preparations for a 72-hour walkout if the Scottish government did not put forward a credible offer. Dates for the strike have not been confirmed.\n\nCommittee chairman Dr Chris Smith said some junior doctors in Scotland were earning a basic salary that equated to about \u00a314 an hour.\n\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme 44% of junior doctors in the BMA were \"actively considering leaving the NHS\".\n\n\"That's just because of the low pay driving people away, which means there are gaps in the rotas, which means the work becomes harder, which drives people into burnout - it's just a self-perpetuating cycle,\" he said.\n\n\"What we need to do now is put a stop to that, and to do that we need a good pay offer from the Scottish government.\"\n\nDr Smith said the historic strike would be \"vital\" to protect the NHS.\n\n\"This ballot result shows, beyond doubt, that junior doctors in Scotland have had enough,\" he said, adding that the pay erosion since 2008 was \"simply unacceptable\".\n\n\"We have made, and continue to make, progress with Scottish government in formal negotiations on pay, but there is still some work to do before there is an offer that we believe could be credibly put to members.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Michael Matheson said negotiations were under way\n\nThe Scottish government previously said the BMA demands were \"simply unaffordable\" unless cuts were made to the NHS and other public services.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf will be under pressure to avert the strike having often pointed out during the SNP leadership campaign his record as health secretary on avoiding NHS strikes in Scotland.\n\nHealth Secretary Michael Matheson said he was \"disappointed\" by the result of the ballot.\n\n\"I will continue to do all I can to avert industrial action in NHS Scotland,\" he said. \"Negotiations to agree a pay uplift are already under way.\n\n\"As these negotiations are held in confidence, it would be inappropriate to offer any further details at this time.\"\n\nJunior doctors had already been awarded a 4.5% pay uplift recommended by the independent Doctors' and Dentists' Pay Review Body, the Scottish government said.\n\nIt wrote to the body earlier in the year asking for a \"separate and specific\" recommendation for junior doctor pay.\n\nDr Tiffany Li, from BMA's Scottish junior doctors committee, told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live the drop in pay in real terms over the past 15 years was the \"equivalent of working three months of the year for free\".\n\n\"What we're simply asking the Scottish government to do is help us to reverse that pay cut and actually bring it back to cost neutral level,\" she said.\n\nDr Li said many doctors were leaving the NHS to work abroad where pay and conditions were better.\n\n\"Patient care is the centre of what we strike for,\" she said.\n\n\"On a daily basis we are seeing that patients are not getting the care that they need.

Watch: Drone shot down over Kyiv leaves trail of fire and smoke in sky\n\nUkraine's air force has shot down one of its own drones which it says had lost control above central Kyiv.\n\nThere were explosions for around 15 to 20 minutes on Thursday evening as air defence attempted to shoot it down in an area near the president's office.\n\nUkraine presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak initially said it was an enemy drone that had been shot down.\n\nBut the air force later admitted it was Ukrainian and had been destroyed to avoid \"undesirable circumstances\".\n\nIn a statement, it said the Bayraktar TB2 UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] had lost control around at 20:00 (17:00 GMT) in the Kyiv region, during a scheduled flight.\n\nIt added that it had taken a decision to shoot it down \"since the uncontrolled presence of UAVs in the sky of the capital could lead to undesirable consequences\".\n\nThere were no casualties or injuries from the falling drone, it said.\n\n\"It's a pity, but this is technology, and such cases happen,\" the statement said. \"It is probably a technical malfunction, the reasons are being established.\"\n\nVideos of efforts to shoot down the drone had been shared widely on social media. Cheers could be heard when the drone was finally taken down.\n\nCity military administration head Serhiy Popko said a fire was brought under control in a building where the drone was brought down in Solomyanskyi district, west of the city centre.\n\nThe incident comes after Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin on Wednesday aimed at assassinating President Vladimir Putin, who was not in the building at the time.\n\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the US was \"undoubtedly\" behind the alleged attack, without providing evidence.\n\nUkraine has said it had nothing to do with the alleged attack on the Kremlin, and has accused Moscow of staging the incident in order to escalate the war.\n\nThirty-two teams will compete in this year's Women's World Cup\n\nThe world's top women footballers are being put at risk because of a lack of pay, medical supervision and suitable training facilities, according to a new report.\n\nThe players' union Fifpro says conditions are a \"barrier to performance\" at the world's six continental championships.\n\nAll, except Europe's, are used as qualifying rounds for the World Cup.\n\nThe BBC has asked world football's governing body Fifa for comment.\n\nFifpro are warning that inadequate playing and support conditions are having a big impact on the health and wellbeing of international football players. A previous Fifpro study suggested that more than one in three footballers experience depressive symptoms.\n\nEarlier this year, Fifa announced equal conditions - but not equal prize money - for its women's and men's World Cup tournaments, including better travel provisions and private hotel rooms for each player.\n\nNow Fifpro are calling for equal conditions when it comes to the", "it is how we do that.\n\n\"It might be a partnership, and that is a really key word, because if it is and it is always invested back into the fabric of our game then those are the key components, because ultimately we still want the English game to be incredibly strong in 50-100 years.\"\n\nThe 2024 edition of The Hundred begins on 23 July, with selected games on BBC TV.\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut has become the longest of the war that Russia launched last year\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated the Wagner paramilitary group, after it claimed to have captured the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nWagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin - posing with some of his fighters - made the claim in a video posted to social media on Saturday.\n\nUkraine's deputy defence minister rejected the claim, but admitted the situation in the city was \"critical\".\n\nOne of the war's bloodiest battles, fighting has raged since August.\n\nWagner paramilitary forces have led the Russian attack on Bakhmut - which analysts say is of little strategic value to Moscow - and has seen thousands of troops killed.\n\nUkraine, for its part, has also decided to make a stand in a battle which has become the longest and bloodiest of the war so far.\n\nBut in comments carried by Russian state media, Mr Putin claimed Wagner troops, supported by Russian air force jets, had completed \"the operation to liberate\" Bakhmut on Saturday after months of intense fighting.\n\nMr Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, leads the thousands-strong group, nominally a private military company.\n\nHe has claimed before that his forces have taken Bakhmut - or most of it - only for Ukrainians to swiftly deny the claims. Mr Prigozhin has also targeted top Russian military officials, criticising them publicly for not supplying his troops with enough ammunition.\n\nIn his latest video claiming control of Bakhmut, Mr Prigozhin said \"no-one can pedantically reproach us for the fact that at least some piece was not taken\".\n\nExplosions can be heard in the background, suggesting fighting continues close to the city, if not inside it.\n\nHe also promised to hand the city over to regular Russian troops later in the month.\n\nHis claims were echoed by the Russian defence ministry on Saturday night, state media in Moscow reported.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin claimed to control Bakhmut in a video flanked by Wagner fighters\n\nBut in a statement on the messaging platform Telegram moments afterwards, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said: \"Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical.\n\n\"As of now, our defenders control some industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area and the private sector.\"\n\nWestern officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Bakhmut, while Ukraine's military has also paid a heavy price.\n\nThere is hardly a building left unscathed, and the city's entire population has vanished.\n\nThe latest Wagner claim came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky went to Japan to attend a meeting of the leaders of the world's most industrialised countries, the G7.\n\nHis Western allies pledged more support, including taking a significant step towards providing F-16 fighter jets, and announced more sanctions on Russia.\n\nRussian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February last year and control parts of its east.\n\nUkraine has been expected to launch an offensive to retake seized territories, but Mr Zelensky recently said that more time is needed to prepare.\n\nHe has called Bakhmut \"a fortress\" of Ukrainian morale.\n\nUkraine's hope is that the fight over Bakhmut has blunted Russia's ability to conduct its own offensive operations, and exhausted its army and supplies.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Protesters ran onto the Scottish Grand National course\n\nPolice have charged 24 people after animal rights protesters tried to disrupt the Scottish Grand National.\n\nA large group breached fences at Ayr racecourse and made towards the track at about 15:20 before a further smaller group tried to disrupt a later race.\n\nPolice Scotland said officers \"safely removed\" people on both occasions and no injuries were reported.\n\nThe force confirmed all 24 charges were over breach of the peace.\n\nAll were released and are due to appear at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday.\n\nSecurity was ramped up at the racecourse after protests delayed the start of the Grand National last week.\n\nThe Ayr protest followed the death of horse Oscar Elite in the 13:50 race on Saturday. Activists said they wanted to stop other horses from dying or coming to harm.\n\nAlthough the activist group Animal Rising claimed to have delayed the 18-horse event, won by Kitty's Light, it started only three minutes late.\n\nThe group said it wanted to highlight the exploitation of animals for sport and food.\n\nIt said it will continue with more race disruptions as well as a series of farm occupations and animal \"rescues\".\n\nProtester Sarah McCaffrey from the group said last week's protest at the Grand National started a \"crucial conversation about our relationship with animals and nature\".\n\nOn Saturday, she said: \"Today we continue that conversation. As a society, we love animals, but we have to find a way to care for them without harming them.\"\n\nMs McCaffrey called for an end to horse racing and a transition to a plant-based food system.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners attempted to rush onto the course\n\nPolice Scotland Assistant Ch Con Tim Mairs said police officers and stewards had responded swiftly to intervene and \"prevent further escalation\".\n\nHe said: \"We worked closely with the event organisers and other partners ahead of the Scottish Grand National to ensure a proportionate plan was in place to keep people safe and facilitate peaceful protest.\"\n\nAyr's managing director David Brown also praised the swift action of the police and security teams on course.\n\nHe said: \"The race went off to time, there was no notable delay and the professionalism of the team up here in Scotland was a credit to them, they dealt with it in a very efficient manner.\"\n\nFollowing the Grand National at Aintree last week, Merseyside Police said they arrested 118 people over disruption which saw nine people enter the course.\n\nUp to 17,000 people were expected at Ayr racecourse for the Scottish version of the race.\n\nThe Scottish Grand National was inaugurated in Ayrshire in 1867 and has taken place at Ayr since 1966.\n\nThe home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was searched for two days at the start of March\n\nPolice had to wait two weeks before they were given permission to raid the home of Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, it has emerged.\n\nThe Crown Office was told on 20 March that Police Scotland wanted a search warrant.\n\nIt was not until 3 April - a week after the SNP leadership contest ended - that the application for a warrant was approved by a sheriff.\n\nOfficers searched the home of the former first minister two days later.\n\nDetails were released by Police Scotland in response to a Freedom of Information Request (FOI) by the Scottish Conservatives that was first reported by the Scottish Sun.\n\nSources close to the inquiry have denied that there was an undue delay.\n\nBut opposition parties said the revelation would \"raise eyebrows\" and questioned the role of Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, who heads the Crown Office but is also a Scottish government minister.\n\nMs Bain did not answer when she was asked by Sky News whether the warrant had been deliberately delayed.\n\nA spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"In all matters, Scotland's prosecutors act independently of political pressure or interference.\"It is standard that any case regarding politicians is dealt with by prosecutors without the involvement of the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General.\"\n\nBBC Scotland understands that a draft search warrant was submitted by the police which the fiscal then discussed with officers before its contents were finalised.\n\nThe warrant, which is reported to have included a long list of items the police wanted to seize, was then signed by a sheriff on the same day it was finished.\n\nMr Murrell, who had quit as the SNP's chief executive on 18 March, was arrested when officers investigating the party's finances arrived at", "grand hall] is the most sensitive part of the building from a heritage aspect and it is completely intact.\n\n\"During the refit the historic atrium balustrade will be removed and restored off site and reinforced with metal to meet current standards.\"\n\nHe said it would take 25 days to clear all the debris from the rooms damaged by the fire.\n\nThe fire did not reach Jenner's grand hall, where the store's Christmas tree would attract customers each year\n\nAll the asbestos in the building had just been removed when the fire happened on 23 January.\n\nThousands of tonnes of material including 300 tonnes of metal had also been removed over 12 months of the refit just before the fire.\n\nAll the material was removed by hand and dropped down a lift shaft before being pushed through a large window onto Rose Street.\n\nMr Rennie added: \"The fire damage to the building could have been horrific if it hadn't been stripped down due to the current refit.\"\n\nA Police Scotland spokeswoman said: \"The police investigation remains ongoing so we are unable to provide any further detail at this stage.\"\n\nA burnt lift shaft in one of two rooms where the fire happened in Jenners\n\nAnders Krogh, from AAA United, the company that manages the building for Anders Holch Povlsen, said Barry Martin remained in their thoughts.\n\nHe told BBC Scotland a permanent memorial to Mr Martin would be erected in the building during the refit.\n\nAt its height, more than 100 firefighters and 22 fire appliances were at the scene of the \"serious and complex fire\" at the Jenners building.\n\nTwo other firefighters taken to hospital were treated for smoke inhalation, and two were treated for burns. A police officer also received treatment.\n\nFounded in 1838, the Jenners building is the oldest department store in Scotland.\n\nBarry Martin was a married father of twin boys, Oliver and Daniel\n\nIt was founded as \"Kennington & Jenner\" in 1838 by Charles Jenner, a linen draper, and Charles Kennington.\n\nThe store has never left its site on Princes Street, but its original building was destroyed by fire in 1892.\n\nIn 1893 the Scottish architect William Hamilton Beattie was appointed to design a replacement, which subsequently opened in 1895.\n\nThe building was sold to private investors in 2005 after House of Fraser bought the Jenners brand and property.\n\nIt was then bought by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen in 2017 for a reported \u00a353m.\n\nDuring the department store refit disused rooms at the top and rear of the building will be turned into a luxury hotel.\n\nNational Rail said the train passed a red signal, and three wheels came off the tracks\n\nPassengers have been warned of delays after a freight train derailed in west London.\n\nNational Rail said it happened at West Ealing at about 06:10 BST.\n\nA spokesperson said a freight train travelling on to the West Ealing goods loop \"passed a red signal, and three wheels of the locomotive came off the tracks\".\n\nGreat Western Railway (GWR), Elizabeth line and Heathrow Express passengers' journeys have been affected.\n\n\"There were no injuries, and we closed the adjacent lines to assess that it was safe for trains to pass,\" the spokesperson added. Lines have since reopened.\n\nIts website says disruption is affecting the line between Paddington, Heathrow Airport and Reading, and could last until 17:00 on Friday.\n\nIn a statement, it said trains could be cancelled, delayed or diverted including on the Elizabeth line between Abbey Wood and Heathrow Terminal 4, Maidenhead and Reading; between London Paddington and Reading; and between Shenfield and Heathrow Terminal 5.\n\nNational Rail said the disruption could last until Friday afternoon\n\nHeathrow Express trains between London Paddington and Heathrow Terminal 5 may also be affected, it said.\n\nA spokesperson for operator GB Railfreight said: \"We are currently working with the relevant authorities to determine the cause of a slow-speed minor derailment of one of our trains in West Ealing.\n\n\"The site of the incident is safe and we're working to get the train re-railed as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIt comes after Network Rail announced last month it would develop a recovery plan for the Reading-London Paddington route, after months of poor performance.\n\nThe route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.\n\nIn December, broken wires left 4,000 passengers stranded on trains for four hours at night near Ladbroke Grove in west London.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

In the last week she just cried and just cried and begged me to help her. I didn't answer.\"\n\nMr Hunter said his wife told him she felt she had \"no life\" due to her repeated trips between hospital and home.\n\nHe told the court at one point she became \"hysterical\" and to calm her down he said he would help end her suffering even though he said he had no intention of doing so.\n\nHowever, on the day of her death, he said he had got up to make coffee and his wife was crying.\n\nAsked by the defence barrister what he remembered, he said his \"mind switched off - I never wanted to kill her\".\n\nHe added he then suffocated his wife with his hand.\n\n\"I don't even know how I thought about it,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know how long I kept my hands there for. She did not attempt to stop me.\n\n\"In my statement I said that she was resisting but she wasn't. She was moving her head. I don't even think she opened her eyes.\"\n\nAsked about his feelings for her, Mr Hunter said he loved his wife and added: \"I regret what I had to do.\n\n\"I would never help her take her life if she hadn't begged me.\"\n\nDavid Hunter told the court he loved his wife Janice\n\nAs he recounted his wife's final few weeks, he said: \"She cried. She couldn't do nothing. She couldn't move.\n\n\"She was sleeping in the leather chair downstairs and for the last week we slept down on those chairs together.\"\n\nResponding to a question from defence lawyer Ritsa Pekri, Mr Hunter said his wife had been unable to look after herself.\n\n\"The last two or three days, she said she couldn't move her arms and had trouble with her legs. She couldn't balance.\n\n\"She was only eating soup. She couldn't hold anything down. She lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination from state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou, Mr Hunter said he had been hoping for a \"small miracle\" to help his wife's health improve and that she would change her mind about wanting to die.\n\nHe said: \"My", "es taking them out of Sudan, away from the conflict and on to Cyprus. Then they were brought to the UK on a chartered flight and into the arms of waiting relatives.\n\nAs of around 22:00 BST on Wednesday six flights had evacuated 536 British nationals from Sudan, the Foreign Office said.\n\nBut there has been criticism of the slowness of the UK government's evacuations compared with other Western countries such as Germany, which completed its evacuations on Tuesday evening.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said the government would be supporting British nationals and their dependents, but added there were no plans to introduce a legal route for people fleeing Sudan to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nHowever, Alicia Kearns, chairwoman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said elderly people dependent on their British citizen children should be allowed on flights to the UK.\n\n\"In the same way we treat children who are dependent on their parents, we should respect that some elderly people are dependent on their children,\" she said.\n\nClashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began on 15 April. Hundreds of people have since died and thousands have been injured in the conflict.\n\nA ceasefire began in Sudan at midnight local time on Monday, but is due to expire at the start of Friday.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly warned the UK could not guarantee how many further flights would depart once the ceasefire ends.\n\nAirlifting large numbers of people out of Sudan has been complicated by major airports becoming battlegrounds, and movement out of the capital has been perilous.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Others had seen dead bodies, she said.\n\nBut now, back in the UK and little over an hour from her home in Acton, west London, Nemar told gathered reporters of her happiness and pride at making it home.\n\n\"I am very happy to be here,\" she said. \"The British government has been marvellous - I feel very proud that I have made it here,\" she added, before wrapping her arms around her sister in emotional scenes.\n\nThere were more tears or relief and joy at the airport, with people saying they finally felt safe and protected.\n\nTariq, who saw the building next to his shelled in Sudan, said: \"We're very grateful to be alive.\"\n\nHe thanked the British government but said they should be trying to save more people.\n\n\"We don't know who's going to make it out. We are very lucky, but not everyone is as lucky as us,\" he added.\n\nShama, one of the first off the airport bus, told reporters and her family: \"We're safe. We're in no danger - I'm back and no longer scared.\"\n\nAsked about the speed of the British response to the violence in Sudan, she said: \"It was slow but we're here.\"\n\nEarlier at Larnaca Airport, in Cyprus - where Britons boarded their second flight - Shereen Soliman spoke of her relief at escaping Sudan.\n\n\"It was something else.

Watch: Fleeing Sudan - first Britons to leave Cyprus for UK soil\n\nShereen was on a three-week holiday with her son Karim, 10, and eight-year-old daughter Diyalam, who were excited to be visiting family in their homeland when the fighting broke out.\n\n\"In two weeks they [her children] were asking me to go back to London.\"\n\nKarim said: \"We heard lots of gunshots while we were in the house. We also heard explosions. I saw men with guns but they were friendly because they were on our team.\"\n\nBut he said he was looking forward to being back in London because it was safe there.\n\nHowever that has not been an option for all of the family. Others did not have the right to go to the UK with her, Shereen said.\n\n\"I had to leave my parents, my siblings, the whole family there. So I'm very worried about them. I really feel sorry for Sudan because it's my home, my country. I wanted my kids to feel safe there.\"\n\nAsked how she felt about the British authorities' handling of the situation compared with the French and the Germans, she said: \"They were slower than the others, but still they saved us.\n\n\"That's what matters, right?\"\n\nHer feelings were shared by fellow British national, Yahya Yahya, who has been trying to flee Sudan with his family since the fighting started 11 days ago.\n\nHe told the BBC it was \"a very difficult time\" and he was \"thankful that we've finally made it to a safe place\".\n\n\"The first day that the war started [I tried to leave the country], because I wanted to try and get my kids to a safe place,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the delay in knowing that Britain would help evacuate its people, Yahya took a sharp intake of breath. \"It was quite difficult, but it was ok,\" he said.\n\nOther stories have emerged of timely escapes. One British man whose sister managed to be evacuated overnight told the BBC she felt overwhelming relief to have escaped Khartoum, where food and water have become scarce because it is not safe for people to leave their homes.\n\nHe said at one point she and 13 others had only four dates and one egg left to share between them.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: British nationals board UK military plane to be evacuated from Sudan\n\nBrigadier Dan Reeve, the most senior military official overseeing the evacuation, said there was capacity to evacuate about 500 people a day.\n\nHe defended the decision not to escort people to the airport, even though some other countries have done this with their nationals.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"This is not a race to get it wrong. In my professional judgement it would not be safe to bring people together in one location in Khartoum and seek to extract them.\n\n\"We've seen incidents of convoys being attacked.\"\n\nAround 120 British troops are supporting the evacuation at the Wadi Seidna airstrip. Downing Street said the British military would defend the airfield in Sudan but clarified efforts would be made to avoid \"active engagement\" with other forces.\n\nThe government is also considering a seaborne evacuation from Port Sudan, some 500 miles from the capital.

Or more dramatically could there be options being kept open for last-minute, surprise changes?\n\nThe balcony has become a key moment for the Royal Family to send a message.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, after the procession gets back from Westminster Abbey, the curtains will be pulled back and a number of invited guests will step out on to the palace balcony, looking out over the gates and at the crowd below.\n\nThere has been an expectation this will be used to highlight the core group of \"working royals\" - those family members who carry out official duties on behalf of the King.\n\nAs well as the King and Queen Consort, that would include close family such as the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and Princess Royal, along with other working royals such as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.\n\nThat approach", "circuit during a Formula 2 race in 2019.\n\nThe race organisers said: \"We want to express our sincere condolences to the family, team and friends.\"\n\nThey added: \"Royal Automobile Club of Belgium, the Circuit of Spa-Francorchamps and SRO Motorsports Group join Alpine and ACI in expressing their sincerest condolences to the driver's family, team and friends.\"\n\nOrganisers of the headline GT race, the 24 Hours of Spa, said on social media: \"All start line entertainments for the 24 Hours of Spa have been cancelled and there will be a minute's silence before the start of the race to honour the memory of Dilano.\"\n\nThe Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine is a European Formula Three racing series intended to be a stepping stone to the FIA Formula Three Championship.\n\nFormula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali said on Twitter: \"We are so sad to learn of the passing of Dilano van 't Hoff today at Spa-Francorchamps.\n\n\"Dilano died in pursuit of his dream to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.

Later, on the cutthroat revenge fantasy Vigilante, she performed a Fosse-inspired chair routine.\n\nBut the highlight for many was the full 10-minute version of All Too Well - the song she allegedly wrote about actor and ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal - which was performed in a flowing red overcoat as snowflakes fell across the stage.\n\nThroughout, the audience sang every word in devoted adoration. The feeling was very clearly mutual.\n\nAt one point, Swift interrupted her own stage patter to deadpan: \"I'm trying to tell you I love you and I'm babbling.\"\n\nEarly reviews for the concert have been enthusiastic, highlighting the extensive setlist and cinematic production values.\n\n\"The queen of pop reclaims her throne,\" declared The Times, adding: \"If there is a danger that shifting between 10 such different albums could lead to an uneven experience it is somehow avoided here, with Swift managing to produce a cohesive experience despite the constantly changing outfits and backdrops.\"\n\n\"She managed to make it look easy, enjoying the journey as much as the Swifties in attendance did,\" agreed local news outlet Arizona Central.\n\n\"The Swifties are certainly going to be Enchanted,\" said Hello magazine, in a review peppered with Swift's song titles.\n\n\"It's been a long wait back to this moment, but karma is, indeed, a queen - and this was worth the wait.\"\n\n\"The achievement is often staggering\" concluded Billboard, \"with costume changes, set-piece upheaval [and] vulnerable moments in a crowd of thousands and sing-alongs that will rival the scope of any tour this year.\"\n\nThe only criticism, from fans and reviewers alike, was that Swift's third album Speak Now was given short shrift, with only one song on the setlist (the understated ballad Enchanted, performed in a ballgown, pictured above).\n\n\"She paid this album dust,\" wrote one concertgoer on Reddit. \"The dress was beautiful though.\"\n\nRumours are already circulating that the Speak Now section will be expanded during the tour, with Swift expected to release a re-recorded version of the album as part of her ongoing campaign to regain control of her masters.\n\nFor now, the 52-date tour is restricted to the US. It is not known whether the extravagant production will come to the rest of the world - but fans are living in hope.\n\nFollow", ", representing the loss of childhood for these poor refugees,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"We love you Ukraine, we all perform tonight, for you.\"\n\nThe evening kicked off with a short video featuring famous faces from around Liverpool including Wirral-born TV baker Paul Hollywood, Ukrainian Everton footballer Vitalii Mykolenko and the late Paul O'Grady.\n\nThe video also contained a surprise cameo from the King and Queen, who unveiled the contest's stage last month.\n\nIsrael's Noa Kirel gave one of the night's most athletic performances\n\nThe royal theme continued with the opening act, Norwegian singer Alessandra, whose barnstorming electropop number Queen of Kings featured a costume inspired by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nAfter that, the audience were treated to ballroom dancers, a Portuguese Moulin Rouge routine, and a re-enactment of a traditional Moldovan wedding ceremony.\n\nCo-host Alesha Dixon even recalled her days in the girl band Mis-Teeq, with a rap about the history of the song contest.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The BBC has spoken to those men sent home, and learnt that some prisoners were offered \u00a31,500 to leave - and some plan to come back.\n\nEach week, a small crowd gathers at the razor-wire fence tucked around the back of Albania's Tirana airport.\n\nThe narrow runway beyond it, pinched between jagged black mountains and the high grey walls of the border police unit, is where UK deportation flights land - closely watched by the families waiting at the fence.\n\nIt takes hours for the deportees to appear, trickling slowly through the gate to be met with hugs, shy smiles and tears.\n\nDeportation flights to Albania have increased since the country signed a joint co-operation agreement with the UK last December, to \"deter and disrupt illegal migration\".\n\nThe UK government's Home Office says more than 1,000 people have been returned since then: around half of them voluntary, the rest a combination of failed asylum seekers and foreign offenders.\n\nThe BBC spoke to dozens of people on several of these deportation flights last month, and found that most came from UK prisons.\n\nSome had been offered money in return for agreeing to deportation, and were released from prison before serving their minimum sentence, under an existing scheme used for foreign offenders.\n\nAlbanian police confirmed that a majority of those forcibly returned this year were convicted of crimes in the UK.\n\nOne cheerful 30-year-old man said he had been serving a six-year sentence for drug offences, and was released for deportation after serving just two of them - a year before he would have been eligible for parole.\n\nHe asked us to hide his identity, so we're calling him Mark.\n\nThe man who we're calling Mark asked the BBC not to identify him\n\n\"The immigration officer came to see us,\" he said. \"They ask if you want to go back [to Albania] or stay in UK. They explained that if you go back, they take one year off from your sentence.\"\n\nMark was also offered \u00a31,500 in financial support to return home, under a separate programme called the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS).\n\nA UK government document clearly states that the scheme is \"a financial incentive\" offered to foreign prisoners \"on the proviso that they co-operate with deportation and waive their right to appeal against it\".\n\nOther prisoners we spoke to on the deportation flights last month had been given the same amount.\n\nMark was deported under the UK's Early Release Scheme (ERS), used for foreign prisoners of all nationalities.\n\nERS does not require the consent of prisoners, but several Albanian deportees we spoke to, including Mark, said their deportation and sentence reduction were presented as voluntary.\n\n\"It was my choice to come back,\" Mark told me. \"Nobody forced me. They offered it to me. They said, 'You decide if you want to go or want to stay'.\"\n\nWe asked the Home Office to confirm how many Albanians had been deported under the ERS since the start of last year, and how many had received financial incentives to co-operate, but it said it did not publish these statistics.\n\nA spokesperson said in a statement: \"The UK and Albanian governments work together to take every opportunity to intercept the work of people smugglers and speed up the removal of Albanians with no legal right to be in the UK.\"\n\nIn March, Edi Rama (right) became the first Albanian prime minister to visit 10 Downing Street\n\nLast year, the government's Nationality and Borders Act extended the early release period allowed under the ERS from nine months to a year. One of the aims of that change, according to a Home Office brief, was to increase the number of removals.\n\nThe same Act also abolished the expiry date for unserved sentences, meaning that prisoners who return to the UK illegally will have to serve the rest of their sentence, no matter how much time has passed - increasing the deterrent for people like Mark.\n\n\"I'm not going back there again,\" he said. \"I'm not going to prison. Now I'm going to look for work, I'm going to be a good guy.\"\n\nBut several of those on the deportation flights last month said they were planning to return to the UK within weeks or even days, despite what many described as a new hard-line approach by police there.\n\n\"They're rounding up Albanians now,\" one man said. \"It's very difficult for Albanians to stay in the UK because police stop you in the road. They don't want us now.\"\n\nHe said he had been sent back to Albania after police stopped the car he was in and found he was undocumented.\n\nHe is still planning to return.\n\nAnother man said he had already been back and forth to the UK three times. \"It's not a problem for me,\" he said. \"I'll go back whenever I want.\"\n\nFor many of those we spoke to, it was economic opportunities that drew them to the UK.\n\nNot for Azem, though - a slight man in his late twenties, who seemed lost inside his clothes.\n\nAzem - not his real name - talks to the BBC's Lucy Williamson on a disused railway track\n\nAzem - not his real name - told us his story on condition of anonymity. He also insisted we meet somewhere remote, where he wouldn't be overheard.\n\nOn a disused railway track over a pretty river sunk into the rolling landscape outside Tirana, Azem talked, his hands trembling.\n\nHe showed me documents detailing his removal from the UK, and the rejection of his asylum claim. He told immigration officials he had fled Albania after gang members put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him for his political activities.\n\nHe was returned back to Albania against his wishes last month.\n\n\"I'm afraid because the same situation can happen again,\" he said.", "introduction of spin, it also proved their downfall as Dean made the breakthrough and Ecclestone quickly took the second New Zealand wicket.\n\nNew Zealand regrouped through Amelia Kerr, captaining the side for the first time in ODIs, and Georgia Plimmer.\n\nHowever, Cross returned to remove them both lbw in an exceptional spell that sparked a New Zealand collapse of eight wickets for 68 runs.\n\nEven after a collapse of their own, the efforts of Jones and Dean ensured the work of England's bowlers did not go to waste.\n\n'Jones and Dean give lesson for us all' - reaction\n\nPlayer of the match Amy Jones on TNT Sports: \"I was just trying to keep it as simple as possible and focus on one ball at a time. It sounds simple but I knew that if I did that then Deano and I would build a good partnership.\n\n\"I tried to be as positive as possible and, when the ball was in my areas, back myself. Then respect the good balls when they bowled in good areas as well.\n\n\"I've done a bit of work on mindset going into run-chases. It's an area I've felt I could do better in so I'm pleased that that work has paid off today.\"\n\nEngland captain Heather Knight: \"I felt like we were in a really good position [at the halfway stage]. The seamers, in particular, bowled really well.\n\n\"The way [Jones and Dean] soaked up pressure to build a partnership and then put the pressure back on the Kiwis was a lesson for us all.\"\n\nNew Zealand captain Amelia Kerr: \"Kate Cross bowled very well on that wicket. We didn't really have any answers to their changes of pace and variation.\n\n\"We were in a position to get 250-plus, but then you look at the bowling side of things and one more wicket and maybe we could have defended 200.\"\n\nTexas Republican Chip Roy tried and failed to stall the bill on Tuesday\n\nDespite a revolt among a handful of hard-line Republicans, a bipartisan deal to raise the US debt ceiling is set to reach the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote on Wednesday evening.\n\nIf a majority of legislators in the chamber approve, the bill will move on to the US Senate. Here's how the drama is playing out on Capitol Hill and a guide to what comes next.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, President Joe Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy finally reached a deal to raise the amount of money the US can borrow, avoid a default on the national debt, and limit federal spending for the next two years.\n\nNow the pair are busy selling their weekend agreement to Congress. First up is the US House of Representatives, which is scheduled to hold a vote on the agreement on Wednesday evening. Republican and Democratic leaders there believe that even with some defections on the left and right, they have the votes to pass a bill - perhaps by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe legislation then moves to the Senate, which will pose new challenges to the agreement. Unlike the Republican-majority House, Democrats control the upper chamber with 51 out of its 100 seats. According to parliamentary rules, 60 votes are required to approve most bills - so some combination of Democratic and Republican votes will be needed.\n\nThose rules also offer individual senators broad powers to slow consideration of legislation for days. With the date when the US will hit its borrowing limit estimated by the US Treasury to be Monday 5 June, that leaves little margin for error or delay.\n\nOne conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, has threatened to use \"every procedural tool\" to slow consideration of the deal. He, and other recalcitrant Republicans, may be mollified if Senate leadership allows the chamber to vote on changes to the deal.\n\nIf any of those changes are approved, however, it could threaten the carefully negotiated balance in the legislation and would almost certainly push final approval past 5 June.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The debt ceiling explained - in under 90 seconds\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate are on board with the deal as it has been negotiated, and will be working to ensure that a final vote is taken quickly and the debt-limit deal reaches Mr Biden's desk for signature into law before a default can occur.\n\nFor the moment financial markets appear to have calmed as the prospect recedes of the global economic chaos that would result from the world's biggest economy defaulting on its $31.4 trillion (\u00a325tn) debt.\n\nThat could change, however, the closer the US approaches that Monday debt-limit deadline without significant progress in Congress. In 2011, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the US credit rating when similar brinksmanship pushed the nation close to its borrowing limit.\n\nThe path to selling the deal has been a rocky one so far. It became clear on Tuesday that some conservative hard-liners in the House would oppose the agreement.\n\nAt a press conference held on the steps of the US Capitol earlier on Tuesday, 11 members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus railed against what they viewed as insufficient spending cuts and budget limitations in the compromise legislation.\n\n\"This deal fails completely,\" said congressman Scott Perry, the leader of the group. He said those who stood with him \"will be absolutely opposed to the deal and will do everything in our power to stop it\".\n\nThey also dodged when asked whether they would call for Mr McCarthy's removal - a step that would escalate the rift forming among Republicans in the House.\n\n\"No matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning for what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow,\" congressman Chip Roy of Texas, another Freedom Caucus member, warned.\n\nThere may also be some defections in both the House and the Senate from left-wing Democrats, who have complained about how the proposed budget cuts fall exclusively on social programmes and objected to the new work requirements on some recipients of low-income aid.\n\nThe Democratic hard-liners, however, have been less organised - and less vocal in their objections - than their conservative counterparts.\n\nA Sheriff's office in Wisconsin responded to an unusual call by a driver, after a bobcat got stuck in a car grille.\n\nOfficials say the animal was unharmed and eventually set free back at the location where it entered the car.\n\nAn eyewitness has captured the moment a large funnel cloud tore through a neighbourhood in the city of Greenwood, Indiana.

Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?\n\nA powerful South Carolina lawyer has been found guilty of murdering his wife and son to distract from his multi-million dollar financial crimes.\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.\n\nHe faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.\n\nMaggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.\n\nAlex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.\n\n\"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.\n\nThe case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO.\n\nMurdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area. Such was their influence that the jurisdiction became known as \"Murdaugh Country\".\n\nBut the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.\n\nMurdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.\n\nAfter the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.\n\nReporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.\n\nMaggie Murdaugh, pictured here with Alex, was said to be a devoted mother\n\nIt took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case.\n\nIn a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.\n\n\"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.\n\nThe case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial.\n\nInstead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPaul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle.\n\nFor 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping.\n\nBut in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background.\n\nOn the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state.\n\nThe court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. The hitman he hired botched the shooting and the bullet only grazed his head.\n\nAlex Murdaugh (right) murdered his wife, Maggie, and his youngest son Paul\n\nLocal resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter.\n\n\"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\"\n\nEarly on in the proceedings, Judge Clifton Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.\n\nInvestigators say he stole nearly $9m from clients and colleagues to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft.\n\nProsecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.\n\nMurdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle.\n\nMaggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.\n\nAlex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.\n\nMaggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.\n\nReaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillance\n\nThe US has accused Russia of reckless behaviour after an American drone crashed into the Black Sea following an encounter with Russian fighter jets.\n\nBefore the collision, Russian jets are said to have dumped fuel into the path of the drone, which the US says was in international airspace.\n\nThe damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.\n\nRussia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.\n\nThe key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down.\n\nUS military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.\n\nSeveral times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement.\n\nPentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.\n\nHe said the jets were able to land following the incident.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBrig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.\n\nThe United States", "could affect fuel prices and consumer confidence in the months ahead.\n\nIAG said flight capacity was back to 94% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year.\n\nFares were up by about 9.5% on average, and revenue reached \u20ac13.6bn -

Send us your views here\n\nEverton stay 16th in the Premier League, but move four points clear of 18th-placed Luton Town, who play at Arsenal on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the draw, the result still set an unwanted club record for the Toffees as this was their 13th successive Premier League match without a win.\n\nThe Toffees have now not won in the league since a 2-0 victory at Burnley on 16 December and this draw took them past their 12-game winless run in the Premier League when, under Mike Walker, they failed to win a dozen matches between August and October 1994.\n\nNewcastle stay eighth, a point behind seventh-placed West Ham, who drew 1-1 at home to Tottenham, with the Magpies having a game in hand on the Hammers.\n\nDepending on who wins the FA Cup, seventh may be enough to qualify for Europe which would be something for Newcastle to cling on to from a tough campaign after last year's highs that saw them finish fourth, qualify for the Champions League and reach the Carabao Cup final.\n\nNewcastle had been buoyed with a stunning fightback on Saturday to beat West Ham from 3-1 down before winning 4-3 and they will see this as a missed opportunity to continue the feel-good factor at St James' Park.\n\nThe hosts nearly took the lead within the opening two minutes but Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - loudly booed throughout by the home fans having played for Sunderland - made a fine save to parry Harvey Barnes' effort.\n\nBut Pickford could not do anything about Isak's strike 13 minutes later for his 19th Newcastle goal of the season. The England goalkeeper then made two excellent saves - to block Jacob Murphy's volley and then acrobatically tip over a powerful effort from Isak.\n\nBoth sides had chances in an open second half, with substitute James Garner hitting the post for Everton within six minutes of his introduction.\n\nNewcastle thought they", "in which the prime minister pays a far lower tax rate than working people who face the highest tax burden in 70 years.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he hoped to be able to publish his tax returns on Thursday.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said Mr Sunak \"snuck\" the records out \"whilst the world is distracted with Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling\".\n\n\"People will be much more concerned today about the staggering tax hikes Rishi Sunak has imposed on them,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said.\n\nMr Sunak said he was glad to publish his tax return \"in the interests of transparency\".\n\nAsked on a visit to north Wales if, given his wealth, he could understand what it is like for people struggling to heat their homes, Mr Sunak said: \"Ultimately what people are interested in is what I'm going to do for them.\"\n\nPointing to government support with energy bills, he said tackling the cost of living was his \"number one priority\".\n\nWhile there is not a long tradition of prime ministers publishing their tax returns, some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have chosen to do so in recent years.\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron published his tax return in 2016 after revelations about his late father's offshore fund were revealed in the Panama Papers.\n\nTheresa May released her tax return during her campaign to be Tory leader in 2016, but did not do so when she was prime minister.\n\nThe two previous prime ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, did not publish their tax returns.\n\nThe financial affairs of Mr Sunak and his family were thrust into the media spotlight when he was chancellor in 2022.\n\nMr Sunak's wife, Ms Murty, revealed she had non-dom status, which meant she did not pay UK tax on her overseas earnings.\n\nMs Murty is the daughter the billionaire founder of Indian IT giant Infosys and owns a share of the company, entitling her to dividend payments.\n\nAs Mr Sunak came under political pressure, Ms Murty released a statement saying she would pay UK tax on her overseas income but retain her non-dom status.\n\nAt about the same time, Mr Sunak admitted he had held a US green card - allowing permanent residence in that country - while he was chancellor.\n\nHe returned the green card in October 2021, ahead of his first trip to the US as a UK government minister.\n\nFollowing these revelations, Mr Sunak referred himself to the prime minister's ethics adviser, who cleared him of breaching ministerial rules over the declaration of his financial arrangements.\n\nThe document released by the government includes an explanation of the prime minister's tax affairs from 2019.\n\nThe document says all of Mr Sunak's investment income and capital gains \"relate to a single US-based investment fund\", which is listed as a \"blind management arrangement\" on the register of ministers' interests.\n\nPoliticians with share portfolios and investments routinely set up blind trusts when they get government jobs. This allows them to continue earning income from their investments without knowing where the money is invested to avoid any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe document says \"some of the income of the US-based investment fund is also subject to tax in other jurisdictions (including the USA)\".\n\nMr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament\n\nMr Sunak - who has previously worked as an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs - has acknowledged that his investments are kept in a financial arrangement known as a blind trust.\n\nIn February, in an interview with TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan, he was asked whether it was right for prime ministers to have blind trusts.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"I think that's better than them having control over them.\"\n\nMr Sunak's records also show that the prime minister paid tax in the US on dividends in the country. A dividend is a sum of money paid by a company to its shareholders out of its profits.\n\n\"These US dividends were also subject to tax in the UK,\" the document says.\n\nThe document says Mr Sunak's previously held green card status did not impact his tax liability in either the UK or the US during the three financial years reported.\n\nShekhar Kapur says Hollywood's push to cast actors of colour comes from guilt\n\nDirector Shekhar Kapur has said Hollywood's push for more diverse casts has come from its guilt over \"all the actors who are not getting work\".\n\nKapur said the inclusion of ethnic minority actors in shows such as Netflix's Bridgerton is \"a good thing\" in terms of opportunity.\n\nBut, he said, it hides \"a greater, more fundamental issue\" of which stories are brought to the big screen.\n\nHe added the rise in protests had helped bring the issue to the fore.\n\n\"Hollywood should be telling stories of that culture, of the culture of the brown people, of the African-American people, of the black people, of Asians,\" he told BBC Newsnight's Sima Kotecha.\n\n\"But what's happening is they're still addicted to their, you know, the narrative is still their point of view.\"\n\nKapur is best known for his films Elizabeth and its sequel The Golden Age, both starring Cate Blanchett, and Bollywood films such as Mr India and Bandit Queen.\n\nWhen asked about Hollywood's efforts to increase the diversity of actors in its films, Kapur described it as \"a guilt trip\" and woke.\n\n\"It's Hollywood feeling guilty about all the actors that are not getting work. And because there's a huge rise of protests,\" he said.\n\nThe live-action remake of The Little Mermaid released in cinemas in May starred black actress and singer Halle Bailey as main character Ariel, which caused controversy in some quarters.\n\nHalle Bailey starred in Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid earlier this year\n\nKapur joined the film industry in India as an actor, before going on to become a director.\n\nHis 1998 film Elizabeth, about the early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, received widespread critical acclaim and several Oscar nominations.\n\nFollowing its release, the director said many of the scripts he received went on to be \"a huge success\", including ones that he turned down.\n\nDiscussing international scripts he would receive, he said: \"It's always an American going in, fixing the world's problem, going to Africa... and I said, 'Don't send me those scripts because it's not true'.\n\nKapur was educated in Delhi before moving to London for a career as a management consultant and chartered accountant\n\n\"For example, if you were going to make Gandhi the answer, the question was: 'Who's the American in it? Who's the American who goes and fixes all the problems? And who's the white man in the film?'\n\n\"And I would refuse to do those films. Absolutely. Because it's not patently not true.\"\n\nKapur was educated in Delhi before moving to London for a career as a management consultant and chartered accountant, but later turned to film directing, releasing his first film Masoom in 1983.\n\nThe 77-year-old, whose most recent film What's Love Got To Do With It? starred Shazad Latif and Lily James, suggested the film industry is contained within far too small a geographical area.\n\n\"I really believe that Hollywood's too concentrated together as like a group,\" he said. \"I think it needs to be taken away and spread out.\n\n\"I would love to see it in Shanghai if you can. I would love to see it in Mumbai or in Tokyo or as it's happening in Seoul.\"\n\nMs Frendo said Saul \"always had the biggest infectious smile and was full of love\"\n\nA teenager who died when his e-bike collided with an ambulance after he was followed by police was \"the most sweetest, kindest boy ever\", his mother has said.\n\nSaul Cookson, 15, was being followed by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) traffic officers in Salford on Thursday until bollards blocked their vehicle's path.\n\nHis e-bike then collided with the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) vehicle.\n\nEmma Frendo said her son had been \"loved by all that met him\".\n\n\"He was the sweetest, most kindest boy ever, and always had the", "including torture, rape and murder - since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion. Russia denies the allegations.\n\nLast July, a video emerged that showed another captured Ukrainian soldier being castrated in the Russian-occupied Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThere have also been accusations against Ukrainian forces, with Moscow accusing soldiers of executing a group of Russian prisoners in November.\n\nA Ukrainian official said the surrender was \"staged\" by Russian troops in an attempt to attack their captors.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has been in the UK for talks with the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe visit came ahead of a Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian forces, expected to begin in the coming weeks.\n\nSince the start of the conflict in Ukraine, the UK has been a major supplier of weapons and equipment to Kyiv, though on a much smaller scale than the US.\n\nSo what exactly is being sent, and how much of a difference is it making?\n\nThe UK confirmed that it had supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles earlier this month.\n\nThe Storm Shadow cruise missile has a range of over 250km (155 miles), according to the manufacturer.\n\nBy contrast, the US-supplied Himars missiles used by Ukraine only have a range of around 80 km (50 miles).\n\nCurrently, Storm Shadow has the longest range of any missile available to Ukraine, and can therefore strike targets previously believed to be safe by Russian forces.\n\nRussia claims the system has already been used against its forces.\n\nThe UK is the first country to supply cruise missiles to Kyiv.\n\nThe UK also led the way in supplying Nato standard main battle tanks to Ukraine.\n\nIn January the UK announced that 14 Challenger 2 tanks would be sent, alongside around 30 AS90 self-propelled guns.\n\nThe Challenger 2 was built in the 1990s, but is significantly more advanced than Warsaw Pact standard tanks used by Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the UK's announcement, several others committed to sending tanks to Ukraine, including Germany with its Leopard 2 model.\n\nMany military analysts believe tanks, in co-ordination will other weapons systems, will be vital to any attempt by Ukraine to dislodge Russian forces from heavily fortified positions in the expected counter-offensive.\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street said that it would supply \"hundreds\" of attack drones and air defence missiles.\n\nThe statement did not reveal what kind of drones would be supplied, but it said they would have a range of over 124 miles (200km).\n\nIt is anticipated they may be used to hit logistics and control facilities deep behind Russian lines.\n\nIn 2022, the Ministry of Defence announced supplies of heavy lift drone systems to provide logistical support to isolated forces.\n\nAnalysts say that drones can be very effective in getting supplies over the \"last mile\" to front line troops, particularly under threat of Russian artillery fire and in situations where there is a risk of encirclement.\n\n\"It's the sheer quantity of stuff needed by troops,\" says Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). \"Every time you can use a drone instead of a soldier to get supplies forward is one less time someone is exposed to extreme danger.\"\n\nThe donation of M270 multiple-launch rocket systems with M31A1 precision munitions to Ukraine was confirmed in 2022.\n\nThe UK's M270 system is similar to the American Himars launchers.\n\nJack Watling Rusi told the BBC: \"These systems are precisely what Ukraine needs. They allow the Ukrainians to out-range a lot of the Russian artillery systems and also to strike with precision.\"\n\nThe UK has sent more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons, or Nlaw, to Ukraine.\n\nNlaws are designed to destroy tanks at short range with a single shot.\n\nCrucially for Ukraine's armed forces who need weapons immediately, the missiles are easy to transport and simple to use. A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMany analysts believe they had a major impact on the course of the conflict in the days following Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,\" says Mr Bronk.\n\nThe weapons have been \"particularly effective\" when used in combination with artillery, he says.\n\nMaritime Brimstone missiles were also sent to Ukraine in 2022.\n\nBrimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.\n\nThe missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.\n\nLaunching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.\n\nWhen used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.\n\n\"It all depends where you hit,\" he says. \"If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.\"\n\nBritain has donated at least 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.\n\nMastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.\n\nAnalysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.\n\nIt is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively.\n\nBritain says it has donated at least six air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.\n\nStarstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.\n\nIt ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,\" says Mr Bronk. \"There's very little you can do about it.\"\n\nHe says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.\n\nThe UK has also supplied Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.\n\nOther equipment supplied by the UK includes:\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nAndy Murray dazzled under the Wimbledon lights again as he led Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a Centre Court thriller stopped by a 23:00 BST curfew.\n\nBritain's Murray is ranked 40th but showed his pedigree on the SW19 grass to lead 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.\n\nThe second-round match was stopped at 22:39 because of the restrictions put in place by the local council.\n\nMurray, who has regularly played late in recent years, and Tsitsipas will resume a captivating contest on Friday.\n\nMoments after 36-year-old Murray had wrapped up the third set, tournament referee Gerry Armstrong walked on to the court and discussed stopping play for the night with each player.\n\nMurray, who screamed out as he fell just before serving out for the lead, signalled to his team the match was being cut short, while 24-year-old Tsitsipas quickly packed his bags.\n\nThe pair will return to Centre Court after Spanish top seed Carlos Alcaraz plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first match, which starts at 13:30.\n\u2022 None Djokovic set for 'duel of the veterans of the tour'\n\nEyes were instantly drawn to this potential blockbuster when the draw was made last Friday and, after both players negotiated their opening matches on different paths, it was billed as the box-office match of the tournament so far.\n\nFurther fuel was added by the memories from their feisty clash at the 2021 US Open, where Murray said he \"lost respect\" for Tsitsipas after a lengthy bathroom break before a final set which the Greek won.\n\nThis time, all the drama remained on the court.\n\nMurray is a two-time champion at the All England Club and has", "\"calmer night\".\n\nAround 45,000 police were deployed across the country for a second night on Saturday.\n\nMore than 1,300 arrests were made on Friday night and more than 900 on Thursday.\n\nOfficials hope that a turning-point may have been reached - that rioters are losing energy thanks to the security crackdown and the massive unpopularity of their exactions.\n\nHowever, until more nights of quiet confirm the trend, no-one is assuming anything.\n\nIn Marseille, heavy clashes took place between police and rioters throughout Saturday evening.\n\nIn footage circulating online, police can be seen using tear gas against people in the city.\n\nThe video shows the clashes taking place on La Canebi\u00e8re, the main avenue in the heart of Marseille.\n\nFrench media report that fighting took place between a large group of rioters and officers.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence along the iconic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e in Paris\n\nIn Paris, large numbers of police were seen along the iconic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es avenue.\n\nThere had been calls on social media for protesters to gather there but the police presence seems to have kept most of them away.\n\nThe capital's police said they made 194 arrests. The Paris region stopped all buses and trams after 21:00 for a second night running.\n\nL'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun said his wife and one of his children had been injured when fleeing an attacker who had rammed his house with a car and then set the car on fire.\n\nHe called it \"a murder attempt of unspeakable cowardice\".\n\nIn the northern city of Lille, police special forces were seen on the streets. Images from the city overnight showed firefighters extinguishing blazes in cars that had been set alight by rioters.\n\nTwenty-one people were arrested in the city of Lyon. Clashes were also reported in Nice and Strasbourg.\n\nNahel's funeral service was held at the mosque in Nanterre earlier on Saturday.\n\nSupporters of the family told the news media to keep away. All filming - even on phones - was banned: \"No Snapchat, no Insta,\" mourners were told.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel was shot after refusing to stop for a traffic check and died after emergency services attended the scene. A video, shared online in the hours following Nahel's death, showed two police officers trying to stop the vehicle and one pointing his weapon at the driver.\n\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot has since been charged with voluntary homicide and apologised to the family. His lawyer said he was devastated.\n\nNahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop.\n\nMore widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force. The UN's human rights office said the unrest was a chance for France \"to address deep issues of racism in law enforcement\".\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence on Friday \"with the greatest firmness\" and said Nahel's death had been used to justify acts of violence - calling it an \"unacceptable exploitation of the adolescent's death\".\n\nThis is the worst leak of US intelligence for 10 years.\n\nNot since former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden and former US Army soldier Chelsea Manning published classified documents has so much supposedly secret intelligence leaked into the public domain.\n\nThe damage is on several levels. Russia now knows exactly what parts of its military intelligence are being eavesdropped on by the US. It will now move swiftly to plug those gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear from the documents that Washington hasn\u2019t just been spying on its enemies, it\u2019s been spying on its friends too \u2013 like Ukraine, Israel and South Korea.\n\nThe scene yesterday near the front line in Bakhmut, Ukraine Image caption: The scene yesterday near the front line in Bakhmut, Ukraine\n\nIt appears that the US has been distributing highly sensitive intelligence to far too wide a circle of people.\n\nThat will make some countries think twice before they can trust America with sensitive information.\n\nBut, by far the most serious damage has been done to Ukraine.\n\nThe leaked documents reveal what weapons Ukraine still has. And the conclusion is that it\u2019s fast running out of air defence missiles.\n\nThat tells the Kremlin that if Ukraine can\u2019t resupply itself then it will be safe to unleash the Russian air force.\n\nThis could potentially change the entire course of the war in Moscow\u2019s favour.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that the complainants in this case have a legal right to lifelong anonymity.\n\nThat's because they are alleged victims of a sexual offence, which means by law their names cannot be published.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the information we tell you does not lead to jigsaw identification.\n\nThat's when bits of information when pieced together can lead to someone being identified.\n\nIt means there may be some details we need to leave out from our reporting because of this.\n\nQuinten carries EpiPens in case he goes into anaphylactic shock\n\nParents of a six-year-old with food allergies have said they faced an \"uphill battle\" to get a good selection of school meals for him.\n\nQuinten from Powys has a severe allergy to dairy, egg, soya and nuts.\n\nHis dad Kam said he \"always feels like the odd one out\" with his friends as he and wife Ceri try to make progress with Powys council to avoid him having bland or repetitive meals.\n\nThe council said its menus were healthy and balanced.\n\nQuinten is in Year 1 and is entitled to free school meals but his parents said they still faced a challenge to make sure he was happy at lunchtime.\n\nKam said: \"I find it really perplexing because Welsh government have announced that this was a priority... yet they seem to be totally unprepared for this, which I don't quite understand.\n\n\"From the very beginning when we knew he was entitled to a meal, it started off at a very basic level in terms of what they came back with.\n\n\"Lots of roast dinners, jacket potatoes without butter or cheese or anything, bland type options and we've had to spend a lot of time working with them to say 'well no, that's not right'.\"\n\nParents Kam and Ceri say they just want Quinten to have the same choices as his friends\n\nOne lunchtime, Quinten had \"a slice of turkey in some gravy\" when his friends had curry.\n\nQuinten's mother Ceri said she and Kam had been told that a \"single supplier policy\" meant the council could not find similar alternatives which would be safe.\n\n\"Their policy is the bit that discriminates against him... I know a lot of people think that he should be grateful to have something, but actually, most people want to be the same as everybody else.\"\n\nAisling Pigott says, while work has been done, \"it's disappointing to hear that some people are not getting the full access that they need\"\n\nAisling Pigott of the British Dietetic Association said she recognised that catering for allergies took \"a lot of planning\" but said a nutritious meal should be available to all children.\n\n\"I think it's all about equity and just because you've got a medical condition or an allergy it's important that you're not excluded from receiving healthy, nutritious food,\" she added.\n\nJake Berriman of Powys council said: \"When we are informed that a child has a special dietary need, our school catering service will liaise with the family directly to provide a menu that will meet their need.\n\n\"These menus, which follow Welsh government guidance, are checked by dieticians to ensure that they are healthy and nutritionally balanced.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said it wanted its free school meals to be \"as inclusive as possible\" and schools were \"expected to make reasonable adjustments to meet any medically prescribed dietary needs\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But now, she added: \"We really are scared of the security [situation].\"\n\n\"If a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed, then what will they do to us?\" Mohammed Aborjela, a Palestinian online content creator who launched the Youth of Gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began, told BBC.\n\nHe said Palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues, but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work. \"The danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed,\" he added.\n\nNatalia Anguera of Action Against Hunger also said it would try to continue working despite \"more and more challenging\" conditions.\n\n\"Most of our staff are... Palestinians. They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it was the only way that aid organisations would be able to scale up their response to the level required.\n\nMr Egeland also stressed the importance of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which he said was \"bigger than the rest of us combined\" but was being \"systematically undermined by Israel\".\n\nIsrael accuses UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which triggered the war when its gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October last year. The agency has denied this, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the attacks.\n\nUNRWA called for a \"complete reversal in policies\" from Israel in response to Monday's strike, including lifting the ban on it delivering aid to northern Gaza.\n\nThe victim was found outside a house in Brentwick Gardens on Wednesday morning\n\nPolice say 10 people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was fatally stabbed in London.\n\nOfficers said the man was found in the street with serious injuries in Brentwick Gardens, Brentford, at 05:15 BST and died at the scene.\n\nIt came after the force was alerted to reports of intruders at an address in the same street.\n\nSeven men and three women were subsequently detained and remain in custody.\n\nDet Supt Figo Forouzan, from Met Police, said: \"This is a truly shocking incident that will understandably cause the community concerns.\n\n\"I want to reassure the Hounslow residents that we have commenced a thorough investigation with the support of our homicide investigation team to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe force has appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThis is the fourth time in as many months that the prime minister has met President Biden.\n\nI have been in tow each time, and it's been fascinating to get a glimpse of their growing relationship.\n\nAnd quite some growing it's had to do.\n\nWhen Rishi Sunak became prime minister, President Biden, in congratulating him, managed to call him Rashee Sanook.\n\nNot long after that, Mr Sunak acknowledged to me that the UK's reputation had \"taken a bit of a knock,\" courtesy of the rolling political chaos of much of 2022.\n\nCore to his brand as prime minister is attempting to personify the opposite: hoping to be seen as dependable, believable, credible, trustworthy.\n\nLittle wonder, then, he ducked a question on the way here about what he made of Prince Harry's remarks that the UK is judged globally by the state of the press and the government - both of which the prince reckons are at \"rock bottom.\"\n\nBut, having tried to prove he can be the gentle jazz of politics rather than the heavy metal that came before, the challenge for Rishi Sunak now is delivery, and quickly, with a general election expected next year.\n\nUkraine will be a recurring theme on this trip.\n\nMr Sunak has told us the UK is looking into who was to blame for the destruction of the huge dam there.\n\nHe said it was too soon to make \"a definitive judgement.\"\n\nBut, he added, if it was intentional, it would represent \"the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.\"\n\nThe UK and US's ongoing support for Kyiv will be central to the discussions between the leaders at the White House on Thursday.\n\nRishi Sunak and Joe Biden met in Japan, last month\n\nAlso on the agenda, the regulation of artificial intelligence and economic cooperation.\n\nOn AI, the prime minister is expected to make the case that the UK can be a global leader on its development and regulation.\n\nAnd on the economy, Rishi Sunak has said he will \"continue discussing\" America's Inflation Reduction Act - which has seen billions in new subsidies targeted at green industries in the US - with some fretting the UK is being left behind.\n\nYou can read more about it here from my colleague Faisal Islam.\n\nThe gulf between the president and the prime minister's instincts on this is wide, if not surprising: a Democratic president opting for massive state intervention, in the hope of greening his economy, reviving left behind areas and bringing manufacturing back to the US.\n\nAnd a Conservative prime minister not naturally drawn towards huge interventions like this - and suggesting \"subsidy races,\" as he put it, were a \"zero sum\" game.\n\nBut even if there is a philosophical opposition from some to what the president is doing, what are the political responses to it?\n\nRishi Sunak said \"we've created lots of jobs\" in green industries and \"reduced carbon faster\" than comparable countries.\n\nHe doesn't believe attempting the same plan as Washington would be wise.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel Reeves - who hopes to become the UK's first ever female chancellor if Labour win the next election - was in the US capital just a few weeks ago, and openly embracing a strategy very similar to Joe Biden's.\n\nIs her plan affordable, and achievable? They are big and, as yet, unanswered questions.\n\nWhat is much clearer is President Biden's attempts to rewire the global economy has implications all over the place - not least on our own domestic economy - and politics.\n\nThe death of a 43-year-old man is the first in the UK to be linked to the \"zombie\" drug xylazine, which is prompting overdose warnings in the US.\n\nNormally used as a large-animal tranquiliser but now being found in heroin, it can cause a dangerously low heart rate and large open skin wounds.\n\nUK experts are calling it \"a really concerning drug\".\n\nThey say drug users should be warned it is now present in the UK but there is no safe dose in humans.\n\nKarl Warburton, form Solihull, West Midlands, died in May 2022 at home and had a history of illicit drug use, according to the coroner's report. He had been referred to addiction services on a number of occasions.\n\nAn examination of his body detected heroin, fentanyl and cocaine in his system, as well as xylazine.\n\nA report on his death in the Journal of Forens", "the BBC that \"the majority of businesses in Ukraine don't plan to make claims for war damages until proper and clear compensation mechanisms are developed and eventually implemented\".\n\nCoca-Cola's factory in Kyiv was damaged early in the war but has since been reopened\n\nThe two-day meeting of business leaders and politicians will also look at if a war insurance scheme can be put into place to encourage some of the private sector investment that the World Bank says is vital to rebuilding the economy.\n\nIn a separate survey it found firms have seen an average 53% drop in sales compared with pre-war 2021. It reported that larger companies have suffered more disruption that smaller firms.\n\nWhilst big companies including Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Unilever have seen their buildings damaged some have already started spending money on rebuilding in Ukraine.\n\nFor that to continue Mr Hunder says \"comprehensive war risk insurance for investors has a key role to play to secure investment in Ukraine's rebuilding and recovery\".\n\nMajor US financial firms Blackrock and JP Morgan are helping Ukraine's government secure private sector investment for rebuilding. That will be key to providing the jobs and innovation that will drive Ukraine's recovery according to the World Bank's Ms Bjerde.\n\n\"Even if the war was to end today, there will be an adjustment period, the economy has changed a lot. Poverty in Ukraine has gone up, the dynamics and the demographics have changed. So there will need to be support for the time to come\".\n\nAfter losing in a very public way to one of the most famous women in the world, Terry Sanderson has lamented that this trial means he's \"going to be on the internet forever\".\n\nSo who was he before he decided to take on Gwyneth Paltrow?\n\nThe former US army captain and retired optometrist filed suit against Paltrow in 2019, three years after their skiing collision in Utah.\n\nSanderson, 76, says he has never been injured in more than 30 years of skiing.\n\nIn trial, a doctor testified that he led an active retirement.\n\n\u201cTerry had been a high-functioning, active person,\u201d neuroradiology specialist Dr Wendell Gibby told the court. \u201cEvery day he was doing lots of things.

Watch: Drone footage posted by Ukrainian official shows Lviv debris after Russian strike\n\nAt least nine people have been killed and power at Europe's largest nuclear plant has been lost after Russia launched missiles across Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west.\n\nBuildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.\n\nUkraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.\n\nThe military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones which were fired.\n\nThe attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when 11 people died after dozens of buildings were struck in several regions.\n\nIn Thursday's attacks, at least five people were killed in Lviv in western Ukraine, after a rocket hit their home, the region's governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.\n\nRussian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.\n\nWhile one person died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.\n\nNuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the \"last link\" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off.\n\nFor the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.\n\nThe director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.\n\n\"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.\n\nRussia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was \"a provocation\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was \"a difficult night\", after Russia resumed its \"wretched tactics\".\n\nHe said energy systems were being restored and all services were working after the \"massive\" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.\n\nIn Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.\n\nMr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.\n\nPeople gathered outside a residential building in Kyiv following the strikes\n\nA mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.\n\n\"About 15\" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with \"critical infrastructure facilities\" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.\n\nOther regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.\n\nThe US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.\n\nShe said the war in Ukraine had become a \"grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage\".\n\n\"We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,\" she said.\n\nEmergency workers attended burning cars damaged by the Russian missile strikes in Kyiv\n\nMs Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional \"mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources\" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.\n\nMoscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.\n\n\"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\"\n\nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.\n\nPaul Heaton also paid for drinks at 60 pubs to mark his 60th birthday last year\n\nPop star Paul Heaton said he is putting money behind the bar of four pubs in Warrington so fans attending a festival can \"have a drink on him\".\n\nThe ex-Housemartins and Beautiful South singer is playing the Neighbourhood Festival in Victoria Park this weekend.\n\nHe also paid for drinks at 60 pubs to mark his 60th birthday last year.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Heaton said the gesture was a \"thank you and a small amount of help\" during the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe pubs involved will be the The Bull's Head on Church Street, The Kings Head on Winwick Street and The Cheshire Cheese on Knutsford Road, which are all within a couple of miles of the festival site.\n\nThe Facebook post said: \"Money will also be left behind the bar of the festival's own pub, the Neighbourhood Inn for anyone heading into the festival early looking to catch any of the artists kicking off the different stages each day.\n\n\"A similar process will be running local to the other Paul Heaton shows over this summer.\"\n\nHeaton shot to fame with the Hull-based Housemartins in the early 80s.\n\nThey had two successful albums and a number of hit singles, including a cover version of Caravan of Love which reached Number One in the UK charts in December 1986.\n\nAfter the band split he formed the Beautiful South in 1988, which became one of the biggest-selling UK acts of all time, releasing 15 albums over nine years.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Until next time.\n\nArtificial-intelligence experts generally follow one of two schools of thought - it will either improve our lives enormously or destroy us all. And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\".\n\nThis week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.\n\nFormer UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders.\n\n\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country\n\nBut there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:\n\n\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.\n\nThere are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:\n\nBut what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?\n\nThe European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product.\n\nCompanies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nBut can developers predict or control how their product might be used?\n\nSo far, AI has been largely self-policed.\n\nThe big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nBut will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?\n\nYou can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.\n\nAnd Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations.\n\n\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\".\n\nIt can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".\n\nChatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.\n\nAnd in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.\n\nBut others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.\n\nChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.\n\nNow, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams.\n\nThe capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.\n\nAnd two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 - \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says.\n\nShe is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.\n\nThe rain warning is in place until 10:00 GMT on Thursday\n\nDisruptive rain is forecast for Northern Ireland from this afternoon with a weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nTravel disruption is expected as the rain becomes more persistent later on Wednesday.\n\nIt is due to last until later on Thursday morning, with between 20mm to 30mm of rain expected quite widely.\n\nSome areas could see up to 40mm of rainfall accumulating during that period.\n\nThat is likely to lead to surface spray and flooding on roads before conditions improve from the west on Thursday.\n\nThe warning is in place from 14:00 GMT on Wednesday until 10:00 GMT on Thursday.\n\nIt comes after heavy snowfall last week caused major delays and disruptions across the country.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It delivers a massive boost to our fundraising endeavour which has caught the public mood across Britain and around the world.\n\n\"The individual who made such a substantial cash gift wishes to remain anonymous and we, of course, respect that request. But to say we are over the moon is putting it mildly.\"\n\nTS Queen Mary carried thousands of passengers from Glasgow on \"doon the watter\" trips on the Clyde\n\nIn its heyday TS Queen Mary carried 13,000 passengers each week and was known as \"Britain's finest pleasure steamer\".\n\nBecause of her strong connection to Glasgow she was also affectionately known as \"The Glasgow Boat.\"\n\nThe steamer was eventually retired in 1977 and spent several years as a floating restaurant on the Thames before being towed back to the Clyde in 2016.\n\nInitially it was thought it might become a static attraction but two years ago, Princess Anne - who is Royal Patron of TS Queen Mary - announced plans to restore the ship to working order.\n\nThe steamer was named after her great-grandmother Queen Mary, who was the wife of King George V.\n\nThe late Harry Potter and Cracker actor Robbie Coltrane was an enthusiastic supporter of the restoration project, while Hollywood star Sam Neill is TS Queen Mary's \"Commonwealth Patron.\"\n\nTS Queen Mary was built in 1933 by shipbuilders William Denny in Dumbarton, for many years providing \"doon the watter\" trips from Glasgow to destinations such as Dunoon, Rothesay, Millport and Arran.\n\nIn 1935 it was renamed Queen Mary II at the request of Cunard White Star Line to release the Queen Mary name for the much larger liner that was being built at the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank.\n\u2022 None Historic steamer to sail on River Clyde once again\n\nLast updated on .From the section European Football\n\nThey said I was too old, I made the Premier League look old - Ibrahimovic AC Milan's Zlatan Ibrahimovic has retired from football at the age of 41, bringing to an end one of the modern era's most glittering careers. \"I say goodbye to football but not to you,\" the Swede told the San Siro crowd after Sunday's last game of the season.

Some of the fraudsters the BBC spoke to were willing to travel to parts of the UK where waiting times are shorter to take the test for others.\n\nCarly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, said the backlog was causing \"a desperation for test slots\".\n\n\"If you're facing the fact that if you don't pass the test you have to wait for up to six months [to try again], then you're going to think about cheating the system,\" she said.\n\nShe added that some of the instructors in her association had been approached by people running criminal services, asking them to refer pupils struggling to pass their test.\n\nThe high demand for tests has led to operators bulk-buying slots using automated software and reselling them at an inflated price.\n\nThe DVSA says it is actively removing accounts which do this as it breaks the terms and conditions of the booking platform.\n\nThe man, who called himself Erdal, told the reporter he could feed them the answers to the theory test via a Bluetooth earpiece\n\nDuring the investigation, the BBC found a flyer in a London cafe written in Turkish offering a \"100% guarantee\" method to pass the theory test.\n\nOur undercover reporter, posing as someone with little experience of driving, met the man behind the advert, who called himself Erdal.\n\nHe told the reporter he could help them cheat by feeding them the answers to the test's multiple choice questions using a \"microscopic\" Bluetooth earpiece, connected to a mobile phone.\n\nHe told them by clicking on the questions they would be \"read out loud\" by the computer which would allow him to whisper the correct answers.\n\nHe said: \"It's \u00a31,500 and you will pay me right after taking the test. You will be wearing a device in your ear. The test administrators will not look in your ear.\n\n\"We have done this for a long time. We do this for a minimum of two people every day.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, the BBC called the number we had for the man to confront him about the scam. The person that answered had the same name but denied knowing anything about test fraud.\n\nThese scam online adverts can also cause identity fraud problems for the people who have photos of their test pass certificates or driving licence lifted from legitimate sites.\n\nWe spoke to Ian Jones, who had a photo of his driving licence stolen from a logistics company he was registered with. He later discovered it was being used on Instagram by someone advertising a service for \"theory/practical certificate without exams\".\n\nMr Jones says in the past year he has had to dispute hundreds of French speeding and parking tickets he has received because his licence details are being used fraudulently abroad.\n\nHe said: \"It makes you paranoid, it gives you a horrible feeling, it's like being burgled - you feel violated.\"\n\nThe DVSA's head of law enforcement said it had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licenses in 2022\n\nThe Driving Standards Agency, (DVSA), which promotes road safety and sets standards for training, warns many online adverts promising full licences quickly are money-making scams which may only provide a fake licence. It adds only the Driving and Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) can issue a genuine driving licence.\n\nThe number of people being prosecuted for test fraud via impersonations are increasing, the DVSA says. If convicted, they face prison sentences and fines. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight months for taking approximately 150 theory and practical tests for other drivers.\n\nThe DVSA warns if people do not meet the necessary driving standards before taking control of a vehicle, it could cause serious injuries or even fatalities.\n\nIts head of law enforcement, Marian Kitson, said its investigation team was catching more people committing fraud and had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licences in 2022.\n\nIn the year from April 2022, it sent 30 cases - involving 497 offences - of fraud by false representation for prosecution and there were 53 arrests.\n\nHowever, Ms Kitson said it was clear from their investigations that there was even more occurring, adding that they did not know the true scale of the problem.\n\n\"The internet is so huge; the social media platforms are vast and these people are very clever, they move the adverts around; they change them frequently,\" she said.\n\n\"So actually, spotting them and taking action quickly is a real challenge.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

Sir Keir says people's circumstances should not hold them back and \"you don't have to change who you are, just to get on\".\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to improve children's speaking skills, as part of a drive to break down class barriers to opportunity.\n\nHe also promised to give vocational and academic learning equal status, in a speech on education policy.\n\nTouching on his own background, he said people from working class backgrounds were now less able to advance in life.\n\nBut his speech was interrupted by protesters, unveiling a banner saying: \"No more u-turns, Green new deal.\"\n\nThe two young people who were protesting were standing right behind Sir Keir on the podium. Later, climate group Green New Deal Rising claimed responsibility for the disruption.\n\nThe Labour leader's speech unveiled details of the fifth and final \"mission\" the party is focused on ahead of the general election, expected next year.\n\nThe missions are expected to form the backbone of the party's election offer to voters, and shape its priorities in government if it wins power.\n\nIn his speech, Sir Keir promised a goal of half a million more children reaching early learning targets by 2030, as well as a review of the curriculum from the beginning of primary school through to the end of compulsory education.\n\nHe said a Labour government would \"tear down\" obstacles to opportunity, which he dubbed the \"class ceiling\".\n\n\"There's something more pernicious here, a pervasive idea, a barrier in our collective mind that narrows our ambitions for working class children and says - sometimes with subtlety, sometimes to your face - this isn't for you,\" he said.\n\nHe said the previous Labour government didn't \"eradicate the snobbery that looks down on vocational education, didn't drain the well of disrespect that this creates, and that cost us.\"\n\nHe said more children should study sport or a creative arts subject until they are 16, as well as a focus on digital skills.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Climate change protesters interrupt Sir Keir Starmer speech calling for a \"green new deal right now\".\n\n\"For our children to succeed, they need a grounding in both, need skills and knowledge, practical problem-solving and academic rigour,\" he said.\n\n\"But now - as the future rushes towards us, we also need a greater emphasis on creativity, on resilience, on emotional intelligence and the ability to adapt.\"\n\nLabour has already committed to recruiting 6,500 extra teachers in shortage subjects such as maths, paid for by removing tax breaks for private schools, which the party calculates will raise over \u00a31bn a year", "to take place and is long overdue.\n\n\"This work is essential to preserve the historic fabric of this much-loved ship, replacing rotten and missing timbers which is causing rapidly accelerating structural damage and strain.\"\n\nA \u00a320,000 donation by American entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria, in November 2022 and a \u00a3100,000 grant received from the Headley Trust in February provided the remaining funds required to carry out the immediate conversation work.\n\u2022 None Scotland's oldest ship goes under the microscope\n\nGreg James and Chris Smith are known for writing children's book series Kid Normal\n\nBBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James has said he and former newsreader Chris Smith are \"so sorry to have caused offence\" with a comment about a glass eye in a video to announce their new children's book.\n\nIn the clip, the duo discussed ideas to make the characters, inspired by Roald Dahl's The Twits, \"more revolting\".\n\nWhen illustrator Emily Jones suggested a glass eye, Smith replied: \"That's it. What a disgusting pair of Twits!\"\n\nThat sparked criticism for a \"negative representation\" of disability.\n\nJames and Smith, who write the popular Kid Normal books, have co-authored The Twits Next Door - part of a new series commissioned by the Roald Dahl Story Company.\n\nIn the video, the pair came up with ways to make the characters look \"really gross\" and \"horrible\".\n\nJames posted on X that it was \"absolutely not our intention\" to cause offence \"and we apologise unreservedly\".\n\nA host of modern authors will put a new spin on Roald Dahl's books\n\nHe wrote: \"We understand that words matter and we pride ourselves on championing and welcoming everyone into the magical world of children's books. We would never dream of deliberately setting out to exclude anyone.\"\n\nJames added that with the glass eye comment, \"we were attempting to pay homage to one of the Twit's most famous pranks involving a glass of beer in order to remind people of Dahl's infamous terrible two\".\n\nHe said it does not form part of the plot of the new story, \"nor was it our intention to suggest that it was in any way disgusting\".\n\n\"It's unfortunate that the word disgusting appears to be a direct comment on that. That's an error on our part.\n\n\"We are devastated that it's come across like this but completely understand why there is anger. And we appreciate everyone rightly calling it out.\n\n\"We hear that fully, we're so upset that we made a mistake but we're still incredibly proud of this book and we're excited to get out there and share it with young readers all over the world x.\"\n\nThe response to the video included The Royal National Institute of Blind People saying: \"When there's positive representation of disabilities in children's books, children with disabilities feel seen and heard, and their friends and classmates treat everyone the same.\n\n\"There is nothing at all revolting about prosthetic eyes, we think they're brilliant.\"\n\nThe sight loss charity encouraged James and Smith to \"talk to us about encouraging acceptance and understanding of disabilities\".\n\nCharity Scope posted on X: \"Positive disability representation in kid's books help improve attitudes and inclusion. So what can we expect of negative representation like this?\"\n\nThey also posted a video saying: \"Greg and Chris, we know you can do better. The disabled community wants to help you get there.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser. Please enable Javascript or try a different browser.

I'd hoped the world had moved on.\"\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement earlier on Friday that James and Smith were among a number of current authors who are writing new stories based on classic Dahl books.\n\nTheir novel will see a new family called the Lovelies move in next door to The Twits, prompting the Twits to hatch a plan to rid themselves of their horribly nice new neighbours. The Twits Next Door will be published in August.\n\nElsewhere, TV presenter Konnie Huq, The Last Leg comedian Adam Hills and author Adam Kay will contribute to a short story collection, Charlie and the Christmas Factory.\n\nThe move follows Netflix's purchase of the rights to Dahl's children's books in 2021. The streaming giant now owns the Roald Dahl Story Company, giving it ultimate control of what happens to Dahl's stories in publishing, as well as TV and film.\n\nIt was tense, uncomfortable, and not just because the room was swelteringly warm.\n\nThe committee\u2019s grilling didn\u2019t last the full five hours some anticipated, but it was still extensive - and long.\n\nSo how did Johnson do? Well, we won\u2019t know just yet whether or not his evidence was enough to convince MPs that when - as he\u2019s admitted - he misled Parliament, he did not do so intentionally or recklessly, and corrected the record at the earliest opportunity.\n\nJohnson seemed at his most confident when he was able to draw on facts that suggest rule breaking wouldn\u2019t have been obvious to him - like that official photographers were present at times and that his birthday gathering was briefed to the Times newspaper. He looked more at ease here.\n\nIt got trickier for him when he started having his own social distancing guidance cited back at him.\n\nThe photographic evidence here became difficult for him as he was forced to explain how drinks gatherings demonstrated social distancing being followed \u201cwherever possible.\u201d\n\nHere he relied mostly on his belief these gatherings were \u201cessential\u201d for work. Will that wash with the committee? We\u2019ll need to wait and see.\n\nHe was most visibly rattled - as were some of the supportive Tory MPs sat behind him - when they grilled him on whether he had adequate assurances that rules were followed, as he claimed to Parliament.\n\nMany watching at home may have made up their minds already about whether or not they back his defence.\n\nBut it could be a while still before we know how all this has landed with the people who really matter now - the MPs who have his fate in their hands.\n\nApple has unveiled a much-anticipated augmented reality headset, Apple Vision Pro, in its first major hardware launch for almost a decade.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook said the new headset \"seamlessly blends the real world and the virtual world\".\n\nThe tech firm also announced its latest iPhone operating system, as well as updates to MacBook Air.\n\nThe headset has a two-hour battery life, costs $3,499 (\u00a32,849) and will be released early next year in the US.\n\nThe cost is considerably higher than virtual reality headsets currently on the market. Last week Meta announced its Quest 3 - which costs $499.\n\nApple said little about generative artificial intelligence - the buzzy technology that is the talk of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe company's share price fell slightly during the announcement, made at a developer's conference at Apple Park, the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California.\n\nThe BBC was among the media outlets at the event, and technology editor Zoe Kleinman was one of the first people in the world to try out the headset.\n\n\"Since current boss Tim Cook took over in 2011, with the possible exception of the Watch, Apple has been unable to come up with the kind of world-changing product of the past,\" she said.\n\n\"Have they done it here?\"\n\nApple Vision Pro looks different to similar headsets on the market - and is more reminiscent of a pair of ski goggles than a virtual reality headset.\n\nApple used the phrase \"augmented reality\" to describe what the new device does.\n\nAugmented reality, also known as mixed reality, superimposes virtual objects in the world around us - enabling us to mix reality with virtual reality by looking through a screen.\n\n\"It's like your phone but right in front of you - big, bright and bold, wherever you are,\" Ms Kleinman said.\n\nIn letting you do things", "the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences.\n\nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria.\n\nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force.\n\nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side.\n\nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital.\n\nIran accuses Israel of carrying out the deadly air strike on its consular building in Damascus\n\nIn interviews here in northern Israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah and force them back from the border.\n\nThey were not put off by Israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th Century, when it occupied a broad strip of South Lebanon to try to protect northern Israel. It even created its own Lebanese militia to help with the fighting. The Israelis pulled out in 2000, under constant military harassment from Hezbollah, after prime minister Ehud Barak, a former head of the army, decided that occupying south Lebanon (Israel called it the \"security zone\") did not make Israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops.\n\nI walked through the ruins of the Avivim winery, which is right on the border wire. It was destroyed in a Hezbollah strike last week. Its owner Shlomi Biton showed me through the wreck of his business. He is 47 and was born in Avivim, which like the rest of northern Israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations. Shlomi fought in Lebanon during his military service, and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for Israel to return to Lebanon for a decisive battle with Hezbollah.\n\n\"There's no other choice,\" he told me next his burnt-out business. \"Otherwise, the community won't return to live here, maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back.\"\n\nIn Kiryat Shmona, a border town where 25,000 Israelis lived, no more than 3,000 people, mostly soldiers and essential workers, are left. The Mayor, Avichai Stern, showed me deserted districts and wrecked buildings. He believes that Israel can remove Hezbollah's threat to the north with a decisive and destructive invasion on the lines of the Gaza war.\n\nThe Mayor of Kyriat Shmona, Avichai Stern shows fragment of shrapnel from a Hezbollah strike on residential buildings in the town\n\nMayor Stern said last year 10,000 Hezbollah fighters practised taking over northern Israel.\n\n\"It can happen here\" he told me, \"just like Gaza. They weren't training to direct traffic in Beirut. The only way to stop it is to go into Lebanon eliminate this threat as soon as possible.\"\n\nExactly six months ago, in deadly secrecy, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to the battle plan it called Operation al-Aqsa flood. The killing on 7 October and everything that has followed destroyed lazy, wishful thinking that it was possible to manage the century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHamas thrust the conflict back to the top of the world's agenda when it killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took more than 250 Israelis and foreign citizens into Gaza as hostages. Many of the 134 Israelis still there are thought to be dead. It was Israel's worst single day since it won its independence war in 1948.\n\nThe \"mighty vengeance\" that Mr Netanyahu promised has so far killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, a majority of whom were civilians. Israel's American-supplied firepower has flattened most of Gaza. The war has spread across the Middle East. It might now be entering a new phase.\n\nThe borderlands between Israel and Lebanon are deceptively beautiful in the first few weeks of spring. Wild flowers and pinecones, not shrapnel, were underfoot as I walked along a stretch of the border with Israeli military officers. Any sense of peace was, of course, an illusion on one of the most dangerous borders in the Middle East. Iran and Hezbollah are making decisions about how to respond to the assassinations in the Damascus and the way Israel is increasing the military pressure in Lebanon. The two allies will want to calibrate their response to avoid a wider, devastating war that neither want.\n\nIsrael does not want that war either. But the audacious assassination at the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus could be a sign that Israel believes Iran and the network it calls its axis of resistance might blink first. If so, it is a risky strategy. Iran will want to restore its ability to deter Israel, which is clearly not working. It will try to respond in a way that will catch Israel by surprise.\n\nThe empty overgrown border communities are not likely to be Iran's first choice for retaliation. They could try an Israeli target in another country, or cyber-attacks rather than missiles. Or intensify their nuclear programme.\n\nAn American envoy, Amos Hochstein, is trying to find a way to revive the UN Security Council resolution that ended the last big war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Neither side has respected it, but it provides a framework for negotiation.\n\nAt this crossroads, neither Israel, Iran nor Hezbollah wants an all-out war that would have terrible consequence for all of them. But no side seems ready to stop the slide towards it.\n\nDon't trust anyone who tells you they know the political implications of this indictment.\n\nI certainly don't, and nor do they. We don't know the charges, we don't know the evidence and we don't know how the trial will unfold.\n\nSince the indictment was announced, I've heard from people close to the former president who've told me this is bad news for Democrats because this is a weak case, the weakest of all the potential cases against Trump.\n\nI've also heard from Democrats who say the spectacle of Trump on trial is bound to weaken him as he runs for the White House, and the reminder of his alleged affair with a former porn star will turn off evangelical Christians who once supported him.\n\nTwo things can be true at once.\n\nThe political question will be in the raw numbers: does it win him more voters or lose him voters?\n\nThe more important question for America is whether this trial, whenever it occurs, can be removed from the political realm and be seen as a fair legal process.\n\nYou can catch Katty on Americast here\n\nLast updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nDomestic women's football could become a \"billion pound industry\" in 10 years' time says former Lionesses midfielder Karen Carney - the chair of a major review into the sport.\n\nHer 126-page report recommends the top two tiers of women's football in England being", "health minister of a lack of duty of care, saying some of the other members were \"suffering from stress and upset\" but there had been \"nothing from Eluned Morgan's team to indicate any awareness of that or any concern for us after the event\".\n\n\"Somebody needs to take responsibility and I can only see two people in the frame potentially - Mark Drakeford and Eluned Morgan,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for BCUHB said: \"The management of the issues raised in the EY report is progressing in line with existing procedures and policies.\n\n\"This follows the conclusion of the NHS Counter Fraud Wales investigation connected to the Auditor General's qualified opinion of the Health Board's 2021-22 financial accounts.\n\n\"It is inappropriate to comment on the status of any employees at this stage.\n\n\"We currently have six independent board members in place, alongside two associate independent members. Two further independent board members are in the process of being appointed and these will be announced in due course.\"\n\nThe withdrawal of support will add hundreds of pounds to some household bills\n\nEnergy bills for most households in Northern Ireland will increase by hundreds of pounds a year from Saturday as government support comes to an end.\n\nThe Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) Scheme was introduced in November 2022, applying a discount to the unit rate of electricity and gas prices.\n\nBut the discount no longer applies from Saturday, having been gradually reduced from since January.\n\nA reduction in April meant bills rose despite price cuts by suppliers.\n\nDeirdre McCausland, a single mother-of-two from west Belfast, who is with Budget Energy, said she was in shock at the increase in bills.\n\nShe said it was \"the worst timing ever\" and that \"something needs to be done about it\".\n\n\"I just keep thinking how much more pressure are families - not just single people like me - the working poor [under]. How much more are we going to be able to tolerate all this?\" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.\n\n\"I only found out about the rise through an email.\n\nDeirdre McCausland, a single mother from west Belfast, said she was in shock at the increase in bills\n\n\"It is the worst timing ever. This is just before the summer - my children got off today, it is their last day of school, and then we are being hit with all these costs.\n\n\"I am just wondering, when is it going to stop?\n\n\"I have a 14-year-old and a nine-year-old. When I was young growing up my parents protected me from poverty; I can't protect my children [and] because of social media they are more aware than ever of what lies ahead.\n\n\"That is an absolute shambles and something needs to be done about it.\"\n\nWhat will this mean for bills?\n\nThe majority of customers will see the tariffs charged by their supplier frozen or cut but the withdrawal of the EPG support will mean that their bills actually increase.\n\nRaymond Gormley of the Consumer Council described the move as \"unfortunate\" as he said prices remained at about double the pre-Covid pandemic norm.\n\nHe said the government would review the need for the scheme every three months until next spring.\n\n\"So if energy prices increase significantly in the winter, the Consumer Council will make the argument to government that they should reinstate a subsidy\".\n\nFalling electricity prices have been offset by a reduction in government support\n\nPower NI is the largest electricity supplier in Northern Ireland, with about 479,000 domestic electricity customers.\n\nIt announced a 7.1% decrease in its standard tariff but the end of the government discount means customers will see an increase of about \u00a349 a year.\n\nThat means a typical annual bill will rise from \u00a3966 in June to \u00a31,015 from July.\n\nSSE Airtricity, Electric Ireland and Budget Energy are not changing their tariffs - customers will see their average bills rise by about \u00a3127 a year.\n\nClick Energy is reducing its standard tariff by 10.36% and other tariffs also also being cut to offset the reduction of government support - customers will see no change in their typical yearly bills.\n\nIt is the smallest of the five Northern Irish electricity suppliers, with about 24,000 customers.\n\nSSE Airtricity provides gas to about 195,000 customers in the Greater Belfast area\n\nSSE Airtricity announced a decrease of 12.2% effective from July but customers will actually see their gas bills increase by about \u00a3134 a year because of the loss of government support.\n\nThat means a typical customer's annual bill will rise from \u00a31,266 in June to \u00a31,399 in July.\n\nSSE Airtricity serves about 195,000 customers in the Greater Belfast area and 3,200 customers in the Gas to the West area.\n\nBills for Firmus Energy customers will increase by about \u00a3328 in both the Ten Towns gas network and the Greater Belfast gas network areas.\n\nFor those in the Ten Towns gas network area, a typical annual bill will rise from \u00a31,147 in June to \u00a31,475 in July.\n\nA typical bill for customers in the Greater Belfast area will rise from \u00a31,190 in June to \u00a31,518 in July.\n\nFrom January to March this year energy bills in Northern Ireland were being discounted by up to 13.6p a unit for electricity and 3.9p a unit for gas.\n\nThat support was reduced from April to June 2023 - bills were discounted by up to 3.8p per unit for electricity and 2.6p per unit for gas.\n\nThe EPG will drop from about \u00a3454 a year in discount for the average household to nothing from 1 July 2023.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the Utility Regulator imposes price controls on the major suppliers: electricity firm Power NI, SSE Airtricity gas in greater Belfast and Firmus Energy gas in the so-called Ten Towns network.\n\nThe regulator approves the maximum tariffs based on the costs for providing the service and a small profit margin.\n\nThe NHS is set to miss a key cancer treatment target laid out in the Covid recovery plan, the national cancer director for England has said.\n\nThe NHS had committed to cutting the backlog of people waiting more than two months to be diagnosed and begin cancer treatment to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBut Dame Cally Palmer told MPs a spike in demand meant NHS England would miss the March 2023 target.\n\nShe said a new target of March 2024 was now being discussed with ministers.\n\nIn its Covid recovery plan published in February 2022, NHS England committed to tackling the substantial backlog of people with suspected cancer who are facing long waits to either start treatment, or be tested and receive the all-clear.\n\nIt set a target to cut the total number of patients having to wait more than two months - or 62 days - to the pre-pandemic level of 14,000 by the end of March 2023.\n\n\"We've made very significant progress, the backlog was at an all-time high of around 34,000 last summer,\" Dame Cally told the Health and Social Care Committee.\n\n\"Last week it was 23,500, so we've dropped by about 10,000 but there's still further to go.\"\n\nMost of the patients on that waiting list will ultimately be told they do not have cancer but, giving evidence to the committee, NHS officials said that long waits for a diagnosis create \"a lot of anxiety for people\".\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, told MPs: \"I don't think anybody is comfortable with the fact that we have a large number of people who are waiting too long to get their diagnosis and start their treatment.\n\n\"What we need to do is contend with a very large number of referrals - between 200,000 to 260,000 people every month are referred for investigation of possible cancer, [of] whom only about 6% will have cancer.\"\n\nDame Deborah James raised millions for cancer research before she died aged 40\n\nDame Cally said the spike in referrals from GPs has been linked to a number of factors including a rise in cancer rates in the population; more people putting off care during the pandemic who are now coming forward; and a wider increase in awareness attributed", "in your browser. Watch: Susan Sarandon on the dangers of AI in film industry\n\nFor actors, pay for individual roles has declined, forcing them to seek several more roles to make the same amount of money as they did a few years ago.\n\nWriting contracts have become shorter and more perilous, with payment often not included for writers' work on revisions or new material.\n\n\"We are being victimised by a very greedy entity,\" Fran Drescher, the current SAG president, said on Thursday. \"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us.\"\n\nThe failed negotiations between the unions and the AMPTP marks the first tandem strike in the industry since 1960. The last actors' strike, in 1980, lasted 10 weeks.\n\nA third union, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), is not participating in the strike after successfully negotiating its own contract in June, but the group has said it \"strongly supports\" those who are picketing.\n\nWith the prospect that the strike could roll on for months, cinemas could face problems, and viewers may be left with nothing new to watch bar reality TV and live sport.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the White House said President Joe Biden \"believes all workers - including actors - deserve fair pay and benefits\".\n\n\"The President supports workers' right to strike and hopes the parties can reach a mutually beneficial agreement,\" spokeswoman Robyn Patterson said.\n\nActors represented by SAG's sister union in the UK - Equity - must continue to work as normal, due to UK employment laws. That includes stars of HBO's House of the Dragon.\n\nThe union has however told US companies it will be keeping a \"very close eye\" on any attempts to move US productions to the UK.\n\nGrimes' music often lives on the threshold between humanity and machines\n\nGrimes has invited musicians to clone her voice using Artificial Intelligence in order to create new songs.\n\nThe pop singer, whose real name is Claire Boucher, said she would \"split 50% royalties on any successful AI-generated song that uses my voice\".\n\n\"Same deal as I would with any artist I collab[orate] with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty,\" she tweeted.\n\nHer declaration comes as the music industry scrambles to react to a spate of AI songs trained on artist's voices\n\nLast week, Universal Music successfully petitioned streaming services to remove a song called Heart On My Sleeve, which used deep-faked vocals from their artists Drake and The Weeknd.\n\nIn a statement, the label said \"the training of generative AI using our artists' music\" was \"a violation of copyright law\". However, that position has not been tested in court, and remains a legal grey area.\n\nA report by The Verge discovered that Universal managed to get the track pulled from YouTube because it contained an unlicensed sample of the producer Metro Boomin' saying his name, which was protected by copyright, rather than any claims over the song itself, which appears to be an original composition.\n\nFor context: Copyright law is very much based on the idea of making a copy - whether it's of a melody or a lyric, by the use of a sample, or making a derivative work like a remix. Heart On My Sleeve did not, it seems, directly lift elements from Drake's previous songs.\n\nDrake and The Weeknd are not thought to have been involved in the creation of Heart On My Sleeve - although some critics have suggested the song was released by Drake as a stunt\n\nFurther to this, the US Copyright Office recently ruled that AI art, including music, can't be copyrighted as it is \"not the product of human authorship\".\n\nIt is still unclear whether art that is created by a human, but which contains AI elements, can be copyrighted.\n\nOn Twitter, Grimes said she was energised by the \"idea of open sourcing all art and killing copyright\".\n\nThe musician said she was already working on a programme \"that should simulate my voice well\", but would also consider releasing a capella tracks for people to train their own software on..\n\nAfter her announcement, fans immediately posted links to songs they had created featuring her vocals.\n\nThe Canadian artist said she was looking forward to being a \"guinea pig\" for the technology, adding: \"I think it's cool to be fused w[ith] a machine\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

[I] don't wanna be responsible for a Nazi anthem unless it's somehow in jest, a la Producers I guess,\" she said, referring to Mel Brooks' infamous satire.\n\nShe suggested she would also remove songs that were \"anti-abortion or [something] like that\".\n\nBut in a later tweet, Grimes said she wasn't sure she had the legal right to ask for songs using her voice to be taken down.\n\n\"Curious what the actual legality is,\" she wrote. \"I think I chose not to copyright my name and likeness back when that was a convo.\"\n\nGrimes has two children with Elon Musk, but the couple split last year\n\nAs an artist, Grimes has long explored the relationship between humans and machines, with songs like We Appreciate Power and Flesh Without Blood exploring the ethical quandaries surrounding Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn 2020, she also teamed up with the mood music company Endel to create an AI-generated lullaby for her first child, named X \u00c6 A-12, with SpaceX founder and Twitter CEO Elon Musk. (The character \u00c6 itself represents \"the Elven spelling of AI\", according to Grimes.)\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, she said she was inspired to create \"a better baby sleeping situation\" for their son using the software.\n\n\"I think AI is great,\" she said in the interview. \"Creatively, I think AI can replace humans.\n\n\"And so I think at some point, we will want to, as a species, have a discussion about how involved AI will be in art.\"\n\nHun Sen has ensured that his party faces no strong challenge in the polls\n\nVoting is under way in Cambodia, where the country's long-term leader is virtually certain to extend his party's rule in an election where there are no serious challengers.\n\nPeople turning up to the polls in Phnom Penh told the BBC they expected the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to sweep all 125 seats in parliament again.\n\nHun Sen, who has been in power for 38 years, faces no real challenge after the only credible opposition party was disqualified in May.\n\n\"It's a rigged election because there are no real strong opposition parties,\" one voter, an aid worker in Phnom Penh, told the BBC earlier this week.\n\nWestern nations, including the US, have also expressed concerns about the integrity of the vote. To ensure the highest possible turnout when people are being offered no real choice, the government has criminalised any attempt to boycott the election or spoil the ballot papers.\n\nOpposition lawmakers this year have reported violent attacks, with Human Rights Watch reporting the government stepped up intimidation and arbitrary arrests of political opposition in the run-up to the poll.\n\nIn May, the government barred the country's main opposition party, the Candlelight Party, on a technicality. The National Election Commission said the party was missing paperwork, which it had not needed for the local elections last year.\n\nCandlelight had won 22% of the vote in local elections last year - and analysts say Hun Sen saw them as a potential threat to his rule.\n\nBut the poll comes as Hun Sen, who cast his vote in the capital early on Sunday morning, shows the clearest signals yet that he's planning to hand power to his eldest son, Hun Manet - possibly within weeks", "think more about their fertile window, and decide to try to increase their reproductive choices,\" she said.\n\nDespite the number of egg collections increasing, less women decided to donate their eggs for another woman to use, according to the report.\n\nThere were nearly 1,500 new egg donors in 2019 but this dropped to just over 1,400 in 2021.\n\nHelen Henry donated some of her eggs at the same times as having some frozen\n\nHelen Henry, from Thurrock in Essex, donated some of her eggs when she had hers frozen 10 years ago at the age of 34.\n\nShe was in a long-term relationship with a partner at the time, who did not want children.\n\n\"I remember having counselling explaining the reason why I wanted to freeze my eggs and being given the opportunity to donate as well. I took that option as I wasn't just doing it for myself.\n\n\"After donating I started to feel quite guilty. I wasn't sure that I had done the right thing. What if the mother of the child isn't a good one? What if the child ends up in foster care? What if it's neglected?\n\n\"Fast forward a few years, I found out that a baby girl was born in December 2011 from my donation. Finding out a child was born made those guilty feelings go away,\" she said.\n\nMs Henry went on to have her own children with a new partner, and never used her frozen eggs, which have now been disposed of.\n\n\"I fell pregnant naturally and quite quickly and had my first daughter at age 39 and I am currently on maternity leave again having had my son last December, aged 44,\" she said.\n\n\"This will be an ongoing conversation with my two children that they have a genetic sister out there in the world. I pray that I will see this child one day. It is one of my last wishes.\"\n\nVicky Pattison says she feels empowered by being able to make the decision to have children when it is right for her\n\nTV presenter and podcaster Vicky Pattison, who also lives in Essex, has just had some of her eggs frozen, after deciding she was not yet ready for children.\n\nThree of her eggs were turned into embryos with her partner's sperm, which she was told have a 20% chance of resulting in a baby. She has also kept three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.\n\nShe shared her feelings throughout the treatment, saying there was \"not enough genuine, honest information out there\".\n\nSuccess is strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, the HFEA said, with higher success rates in those aged under 35.\n\nConsultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Bassel Wattar said more work was needed to inform patients and support them through their fertility journey.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is limited public awareness on the pros and cons of this treatment and how it could be best planned to optimise chances of starting a family in the future,\" he said.\n\nAre you freezing your eggs?

Iain Duncan Smith and Johnny Mercer on Tobias Ellwood\u2019s comments about Afghanistan being \"peaceful and stable\".\n\nMr Francois, who also sits on the defence committee, said the video \"made no mention of the fact that the Taliban is still attempting to identify and kill Afghan citizens who helped our armed forces, or of the fact that young girls in Afghanistan do not even have the right to go to school\".\n\nMr Ellwood, whose brother was killed by Islamists in the 2002 Bali bombings, said he wanted to ensure terrorism does not \"flourish\" in Afghanistan.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, he said he understood his comments would \"cause waves\", but he was pleased he had \"shone a light on a country that we ran away from\".\n\n\"The current strategy of us shouting from afar to try and effect the agenda in Afghanistan is not working,\" he said, adding that he was speaking an \"an individual MP\".\n\n\"We need to engage more directly", "of the general election, expected next year, adding it still included a \"bit of confusion and a bit of fence-sitting\".\n\nWomen and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said Labour's new position is a \"copy and paste\" of the government's position.\n\nAdding that some Labour MPs had previously attacked the Conservative position as prejudiced, she accused the party of \"bare-faced hypocrisy\".\n\nHeathrow Airport has said that some passengers may face security delays over the Easter holidays due to strike action over pay.\n\nHundreds of security officers in the Unite union, who work for Heathrow Airport, have begun 10 days of industrial action.\n\nIt threatens disruption at the UK's largest airport at the start of the Easter school holidays.\n\nHowever, Heathrow said the airport was operating \"as normal\" on Friday.\n\nThe strike involves security guards at Terminal 5, which is only used by British Airways, and those who check cargo. Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.\n\nHeathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than \u00a31,000.\n\nThe airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.\n\nHowever, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.\n\nPicket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being \"well supported\".\n\nHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC \"many\" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but \"a lot\" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside \"hundreds\" of managers who were \"here to help\".\n\n\"The airport is operating as normal,\" he said.\n\nAre you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.\n\nThe next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.\n\nAhead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.\n\nBritish Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.\n\nThe strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.\n\nHeathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.\n\nTravellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.\n\nPassengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.\n\nThe aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused by staff shortages.\n\nA leaked letter to businesses from the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport, seen by the BBC, says it would be unacceptable for consumers to face the same level of disruption this year.\n\nAirlines and airports have told the BBC they are confident of having enough staff in place this time round, although external factors such as strikes in France affecting air traffic control could cause issues.\n\nThe Empire Pool and trolley buses - two sights no longer seen in Cardiff\n\nSome of the last traces of arguably the biggest event ever to be hosted in Wales are set to disappear.\n\nWith 1,130 athletes from 35 countries descending on Cardiff, experts believe the country may never see the like of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games again.\n\nLittle remains of the venues used, with the Sophia Gardens Pavilion demolished in 1982 and the Empire Pool in 1998.\n\nThe velodrome at Maindy could soon be bulldozed too under plans.\n\nIt is the last remnant of an event sports author Huw Richards believes trumps the 1999 Rugby World Cup as the biggest hosted here.\n\n\"As soon as you set foot in the Arms Park, and saw the gathering of elite athletes from all over the globe, you could feel a sense that Wales had become a grown-up member of the world community,\" is how cultural historian Prof Peter Stead described the games.\n\nFor younger generations, Maindy Velodrome is best known for nurturing some of Wales' greatest cycling talents, including 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas.\n\nBut it is also where riders battled it out for gold in 1958.\n\nUnder proposals, an expansion of Cathays High School would see the velodrome lost, and a new track built at Cardiff Bay.\n\nBritish cyclist Ray Booty waves as he gets the chequered flag to win the 120 miles road race - which started and finished in St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan\n\nThe club that uses it, Maindy Flyers, said the prospect of \"being left with nothing for future generations of cyclists\" was \"unacceptable\".\n\nCardiff council replied by saying it fully understands the site's \"historic nature\", but the new velodrome had the support of the national governing body for cycling.\n\nCardiff Central station remains - but the frontage looked a bit different in 1958\n\nSimilar pain was felt by the swimming community when another of the venues from 1958 disappeared.\n\nThe Empire Pool had 1,722 seats, diving boards and the country's only 50m pool - but was flattened as the Millennium Stadium rose up to dominate the city centre in the late '90s.\n\n\"The Empire Pool was an iconic facility in the heart of the capital that not only opened its doors to the world at the 1958 Empire Games, but also served to develop some of our nation's finest athletes,\" said Swim Wales' head of aquatics and inclusion Sioned Williams.\n\n\"To lose this piece of history was a big blow to the Welsh aquatics community.\"\n\nHowever, she said its replacement, the Wales National Pool in Swansea has become a \"thriving hub\" for its elite programme and events, while there is also now an Olympic-sized pool in Cardiff Bay.\n\nOpening ceremony for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Cardiff Arms Park\n\nComing three years after Cardiff was confirmed as capital, the 1958 games were \"a significant moment\" for the nation, according to sports historian Huw Richards.\n\nBut he added: \"It has to be remembered that they were rather smaller than they have since become - with just over 1,100 athletes in 94 events, compared to 5,000 competing in 280 at the most recent games in Birmingham.\"\n\nCardiff Arms Park was where the drama on the track unfolded - but it looked very different then, a 60,000-capacity stadium where Cardiff RFC and the national rugby side played.\n\nA series of redesigns means it now holds 12,500, with the only remaining parts the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates - erected in 1949 to commemorate one of Wales' greatest rugby players.\n\nThe Empire Pool and other buildings were demolished as the new Millennium Stadium - now the Principality Stadium - rose up on the banks of the River Taff in the mid '90s\n\nIt stands in the shadow of the Principality Stadium next door, the site of which has also undergone massive transformation since 1958.\n\nWork on a new National Stadium began in 1969, with it not officially opened until 1984.\n\nBut just 11 years later, it was decided to demolish it for a super-stadium to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThis tournament is the main rival to the 1958 games as Wales' biggest ever event - but comparisons do not stand up to scrutiny, according to Mr Richards.\n\n\"In 1999, Wales was the host of record, staging the opening game and the final, but the event was spread evenly across all of what were then the five nations,\" he added.\n\n\"Wales had only nine games out of 41. The other four nations got", "biggest infectious smile and was full of love,\" she said.\n\n\"Saul was a much-loved son, brother, grandson, and nephew, loved by all that met him.\"\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct has begun an investigation into Thursday's collision\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said an investigation into the collision.\n\nIt said Saul had been riding a black off-road Sur-Ron e-bike and was followed by officers along Fitzwarren Street and on to Lower Seedley Road at about 14:00 BST before the crash on Langworthy Road.\n\nWhile not on an active call at the time of the crash, NWAS said its vehicle was being driven back to a nearby ambulance station.\n\nIts crew were immediately able to treat the boy before taking him to hospital, where he later died.\n\nPolice and independent investigators have been examining the scene of the crash\n\nWriting on Facebook, Taylor-Jade Cookson paid tribute to her brother and said \"words cannot describe my feelings at the moment\".\n\n\"Rest in peace Saul I love you,\" she added.\n\nDozens of people have been leaving flowers and cards at the scene.\n\nTwo sapphire blue, heart-shaped balloons have been tied at the foot of a lamppost, along with flowers, candles, cards and a large white banner full of handwritten messages.\n\nAnother, circled with red hearts, simply reads \"Gone but not forgotten\".\n\nOne of Saul's relatives who attended the scene to lay flowers said the family was \"a mess\" following their loss.\n\nSaul's friend, 21-year-old Mitchell Murden, said he had been due to meet him on the day he died.\n\nHe described Saul as \"a good lad\" who \"kept himself to himself\".\n\nFamily friend Jacob Bailey said \"no-one had a bad word to say\" about Saul\n\nFamily friend Jacob Bailey, 19, told BBC Newsbeat he came to lay some flowers and pay his respects as he had \"known Saul since I was about five\".\n\n\"He was just one of those proper nice kids,\" he said.\n\n\"He never ever caused anyone any harm.\n\n\"No-one had a bad word to say about Saul.\"\n\nNeighbour Karen Cosgrove said she had passed the scene at about 14:30 BST on Thursday and saw Saul lying on the ground.\n\n\"I walked away, I could barely look at it,\" she said.\n\n\"His mum was there, she was screaming.\n\nHeartfelt messages have been left at the crash scene\n\nSome concerns have been expressed by local people about the availability and use of high-powered e-bikes.\n\nMr Murden said \"the majority\" of young people in the area had them.\n\nMike McCusker, lead member for transport at Salford City Council, said there was \"growing concern\" in the community about e-bikes, particularly \"very young men riding round without helmets on\".\n\n\"The ones we have on our loan schemes are limited to about 15mph, but there are unregulated ones that can go up to speeds of 60mph.\n\n\"We don't think regulation is keeping track with the technological advancements around e-bikes.\"\n\nFlowers and candles have also been left at the scene\n\nIn a statement, GMP said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy who tragically died.\"\n\nThe IOPC said it had begun gathering evidence, including dashcam footage from the police vehicle, and had taken initial statements from two police officers, who were being treated as witnesses.\n\nA representative said there was \"no indication at this early time... of direct physical contact between the police vehicle and the e-bike\", but examinations of both were \"continuing\".\n\nIOPC regional director Catherine Bates said it was \"important we understand the events leading up to this incident and will be looking at the actions and decision-making of police prior to the collision, including the reason for the decision to follow the bike\".\n\nShe asked anyone who witnessed or had dashcam footage of the collision or \"events leading up to it\" to get in touch.\n\nWere you in the area?

I feel a lot of it was blamed on mental health.\"I was told that I should be mindful and getting out in the fresh air, which felt very patronising.\"\n\nEmma said she believed that if her employer were to make some changes, she would be able to return to her role.\n\n\"I was told I'd need to complete a high number of hours on my first week of return - not all illnesses can accommodate strict policy,\" she said.\n\nNicola Allen has recently returned to work with a friend's company\n\nNicola Allen from Whitchurch, Cardiff, started experiencing health issues during pregnancy and was later diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\"I always had the plan that I would return to work when my son was in school full-time, but that didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nNicola had worked in London for many years as an assistant buyer for a popular high street clothes shop.\n\nAfter about eight years out of work, Nicola was recently offered a part-time employment opportunity through a friend's company.\n\nShe said: \"My previous career was demanding so I was nervous, but they were clear they wanted me, as me - and they understood my conditions.\n\n\"I even told them I was frightened, because I didn't want to let them down, or myself down.\"\n\nThe support Nicola is given means she can manage her health as and when she needs to.\n\nShe said she felt more confident as a result.\n\n\"Long-term sick doesn't mean we don't want to work, we do - we're just unfortunately not being given the opportunities that work with our illnesses,\" she said.\n\nAbout 2.5 million people in the UK are not working due to health problems, the Office for National Statistics said.\n\nIt said an increase in mental health issues and people suffering back pain, possibly due to home working, were the main causes of the rise.\n\nTypically, for every 13 people currently working, one person is long-term sick.\n\n\"Figures had started going up before the pandemic but that trend continued into the pandemic and accelerated in 2021 to reach a record high,\" said David Freeman, head of labour markets and household at the Office of National Statistics.\n\nHe said there had been a change in types of illnesses - including post-viral fatigue \"which could be linked to long-Covid\". He also described rising cases of people affected by back and mental health issues.\n\nHead of Wales at Federation of Small Businesses, Ben Cottam, said: \"Illness costs businesses financially across the UK \u00a35 billion a year, so there is a definite economic impact, which is why we'd like to see government-targeted intervention.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Welsh government said: \"We are working to help people suffering with ill-health back into work. Our plan for employability and skills prioritises people most in need of help.\n\n\"This includes supporting people to stay in", "hot issue too. The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.\n\nOne highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.\n\nHe has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.\n\nThe slogan \"Let Txapote vote for you\" accuses Pedro S\u00e1nchez of relying on the support of separatist killers\n\nThe slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.\n\nAs Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.\n\nThe biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe.\n\nBut dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (L) called the snap election but Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o is favourite to win\n\nHe became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHis brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.\n\nHe has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.\n\nBut this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o has been less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a coalition with the far right\n\nThe Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\".\n\nHe was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate with Mr S\u00e1nchez, telling him he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts because the Socialist leader had relied on separatists.\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o was later criticised for skipping the final televised debate before the election, which was attended by both his opponents, Mr S\u00e1nchez and Ms D\u00edaz, and his potential coalition partner, Santiago Abascal.\n\nA former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.\n\nHe has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.\n\nHowever, his rivals have highlighted 10-year-old rumours that he had a close friendship with a Galician drug trafficker and money launderer called Marcial Dorado.\n\nPhotographs of the two on holiday together on a yacht in 1995 were unearthed by Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds in 2013.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o says he was unaware Dorado was a criminal when the two became friends because \"back then we had no internet or Google\". Mr S\u00e1nchez has accused Mr Feij\u00f3o of lying, but the PP leader has hit back accusing him of using \"rubbish\" to seek to discredit him.\n\nSantiago Abascal's party takes a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights\n\nHe has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men.\n\nLast month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"\n\nVox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.\n\nNow Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.\n\nHe has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nMs Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".\n\nYolanda D\u00edaz has gained popularity in Spain for her headline-grabbing policies\n\nIf Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.\n\nA former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".\n\nSumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives.\n\nMs D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.\n\nSparks flew between Ms Diaz and Mr Abascal in the last televised debate before the election as the two clashed over issues of gender violence, while she and Mr S\u00e1nchez appeared to form a united front.\n\nWhile opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections.\n\nThe last opinion polls published in Spain put the PP on 33%-36% of the vote and the Socialists on under 29%. Vox and Sumar are almost neck and neck on 12.5-13.5%.\n\nTo win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results.\n\nVox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three autonomous regions, and lesser alliances have been reached in Murcia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands,\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.\n\nThe PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox.\n\nIn their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.\n\nBut Vox could be the only option. Last month Maria Guardiola, the PP president of the western Extremadura region, said she would never govern with a party that \"dehumanises immigrants\" and that \"rubbishes\" L", "one of the most lacking, according to Dr Ewan Birney, deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Lab near Cambridge.\n\n\"The most important place in the World to get genomes from is sub-Saharan Africa. It is where we started as a species, and it has the greatest genetic diversity. So, one African American genome is not enough to represent that diversity\".\n\nDr Zamin Iqbal, a senior researcher at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, believes that a more representative genome will lead to better treatments for more people.\n\n\"Expanding the range of populations present in the human reference genome will reduce a long-standing implicit bias in studies of human genetics. Humans are diverse, and it's important that our analytical methods incorporate that.\n\nTwo recent studies in the US and in the UK and Ireland found that children of European ancestry were twice as likely to be diagnosed with genetic tests than those of African ancestry.\n\nDr Alexander Arguello, who is the programme director at at the National Human Genome Research Institute, says the aim of the new project was to change those outcomes.\n\n\"The hope is that once you capture sufficient diversity you will get the same diagnostic results whatever the population\".\n\nThe new pangenome is made up from 47 people, half of whom have ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa, a third from the Americas, 13% from China and 2% from Europe, with representation of indigenous people.\n\nBut this is just the start of an ambitious programme to better represent the diversity of the world's population. The initial aim is to increase the number to 350. After that the scientists leading the largely US programme plan to increase numbers and diversity further by working with organisations from other countries in what they hope will become phase two of the human genome project.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThe settlement is separate from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which started in September 2017\n\nLawyers acting for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and bereaved family members have been outlining the details of a civil damages claim settlement.\n\nAt the High Court, barrister Richard Hermer KC said a compensation sum of about \u00a3150m had been awarded across 900 cases in the \"global settlement\".\n\nThe June 2017 fire at the west London tower block killed 72 people.\n\nMeanwhile, it has now been confirmed the Grenfell Inquiry report is unlikely to be published until 2024.\n\nThe panel and team working on the phase two report have insisted they will \"spare no effort\" to finish it as soon as possible. Its final hearing was on 10 November 2022.\n\nThe long-running inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is examining the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the blaze.\n\nAt the settlement hearing at the High Court, listings indicate the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was one of a number of defendants.\n\nThe London Fire Commissioner was also listed as a defendant, while cladding giant Arconic previously confirmed it was another. The firm said it had \"agreed to contribute to a restorative justice project to benefit the community affected by the fire\".\n\nA total of \u00a350m, including \u00a325m from government and \u00a36m from Arconic, has been pledged to the settlement fund.\n\nThose who took part in the claim were represented by 14 legal firms although the settlement does not include all victims of the fire.\n\nIt has been stressed that the agreement does not affect the potential for any criminal charges to be brought in the future.\n\nMr Hermer said: \"No amount of money will ever truly compensate for what the claimants have had to endure.\n\n\"This is a settlement purely of the civil claims for compensation. The settlement does not right the wrong, it does not secure accountability.\"\n\nThe judge, Senior Master Barbara Fontaine, specifically approved financial arrangements regarding the claims made by eight children, as part of the wider settlement. Lawyers said she would examine issues such as investment arrangements for these claimants.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

That was his goal and dream.\"\n\nAlison Irwin, a representative from the Nepal Ireland Society, said Mr Hanna did a lot of work in promoting connections between the two countries.\n\n\"He had a huge love of Nepal, through his mountains, and was very, very interested in all things Nepal,\" she said.\n\nMs Irwin described feeling delighted for Mr Hanna when she heard he had reached the peak of Annapurna this week.\n\nShe added: \"The first thought that came into my head when I saw the summit news was, 'well, I hope he gets down safe'. And I woke up this morning to that bad news.\"\n\nThe society has extended condolences to Mr Hanna's family.\n\nMs Irwin said Mr Hanna's proudest achievement was reaching the summit of Burke-Khang (6942m; 22775ft), which she said some sherpas described as \"unclimbable\".\n\n\"He was very modest in his achievements,\" she added.\n\nNoel Hanna previously told the BBC he relishes the challenge of tackling the world's highest mountains\n\nMourne Mountain Adventures, a guided hiking company based in Kilkeel, has paid tribute to Mr Hanna.\n\nIn a social media post, the company said: \"There is some peace in that he spent his last moments doing what he loved best, such a great man and one of N Ireland's finest mountaineers.\"\n\nDan McFarland, the head coach at Ulster Rugby, tweeted: \"Very sad to hear of Noel's passing.

We've got strong support in Rutherglen and right across that region but it will take hard work\".\n\nShadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said said it was right that Parliament had \"thrown the book\" at Ferrier, and said the SNP still had questions to answer on what they knew and what they did at the time.\n\n\"Ferrier should do the right thing and stand down as an MP. Her constituents deserve better and that means a by-election\", he said.\n\nThe recall process has only been used three times in the past.\n\nIn the first instance - a petition against DUP MP Ian Paisley in 2018 - the 10% threshold was not met.\n\nHowever, it was met in the other two cases, against Labour MP Fiona Onasanya and Tory Chris Davies in 2019. Ms Onasanya did not contest the by-election in her seat, while Mr Davies stood in the by-election and lost.\n\nThe rules of the House of Commons mean that if an MP is suspended for 10 sitting days, a recall petition can be opened in their constituency.\n\nThe petition is open for six weeks, and if 10% of voters in the area sign it, it will trigger a by-election.\n\nSo there are a few hoops to jump through - the suspension is still to be approved by MPs, and given the ongoing parliamentary proceedings against Boris Johnson there is fierce debate about what sanctions should be applied for Covid rule breaches.\n\nMs Ferrier also has the right to appeal the committee's decision.\n\nBut it still seems likely there will be a by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West - a seat which has changed hands at the last three general elections.\n\nMs Ferrier won it for the SNP with a majority of 9.7% in 2019, but it was already a key target for Labour.\n\nAn early contest would be an immediate test for the SNP leader Humza Yousaf - and also for Labour counterparts Sir Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, in their quest to spark a revival in former Scottish heartlands.\n\nJoe Flaherty performs onstage during the Second City 20th Anniversary show in Chicago, 1979\n\nJoe Flaherty, the American actor and comedian known for his roles on Freaks and Geeks and the sketch comedy series SCTV, has died at the age of 82.\n\nFlaherty's death was announced by his daughter, Gudrun, who said it came after a \"brief illness\".\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Flaherty got his start in comedy as part of Chicago's improv group The Second City.\n\nHis career spanned nearly five decades, with credits on many beloved television comedies like Frasier and Family Guy.\n\nIn a statement, Gudrun said her father had an \"unwavering passion for movies from the 40s and 50s\", which influenced his career.\n\nShe added that he was particularly fond of his time on SCTV.\n\n\"He cherished every moment spent on the show, so proud of its success and so proud to be part of an amazing cast,\" she said.\n\nComedian Martin Short, Flaherty's former SCTV castmate, said in a statement: \"There were very few people as wise or hilarious when it came to comedy, teaching improvisation and the art of character work as Joe.\n\n\"In SCTV we called him the anchor. In life, he was simply the funniest man in the room. I just adored him.\"\n\nAfter eight years on SCTV, Flaherty was cast on the teen comedy-drama Freaks and Greeks as Harold Weir, the father of two awkward teenagers.\n\nThe series was cancelled after a single season but later became a cult classic and launched the careers of several young actors, including James Franco, Seth Rogen, Busy Philipps, Jason Segel and Linda Cardellini.\n\nFlaherty was also known for a small but memorable role in the 1996 film Happy Gilmore, where he played a heckler who taunts the titular golf player, played by Adam Sandler.\n\nThe actor was beloved not only in his native US but also in Canada, where he had later moved to launch Toronto's arm of the improv troupe The Second City.\n\nCast members from SCTV, including Joe Flaherty (far left) around their star on the Walk of Fame in Toronto, Canada\n\nHe appeared in several Canadian sitcoms and had a guest appearance on Canadian sketch comedy show the Royal Canadian Air Farce.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Adam Sandler said he \"worshipped Joe growing up\".\n\n\"Couldn't be more fun to have him heckle me on the golf course.

Generative AI uses algorithms and predictive text to create new content based on prompts.\n\nGPT-4 has \"more advanced reasoning skills\" than ChatGPT, OpenAI said. The model can, for example, find available meeting times for three schedules.\n\nOpenAI also announced new partnerships with language learning app Duolingo and Be My Eyes, an application for the visually impaired, to create AI Chatbots which can assist their users using natural language.\n\nHowever, like its predecessors, OpenAI has warned that GPT-4 is still not fully reliable and may \"hallucinate\" - a phenomenon where AI invents facts or makes reasoning errors.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nJust Stop Oil protesters interrupted play twice at Wimbledon by throwing orange-coloured confetti and jigsaw pieces on to court 18.\n\nThe contest between Grigor Dimitrov and Sho Shimabukuro was targeted by two protesters.\n\nA third protester then targeted Katie Boulter's match against Daria Saville.

Tory Budget shows 'just how out of touch they are' - Starmer\n\nSir Keir Starmer has accused the chancellor of \"dressing up stagnation as stability\" in his Budget.\n\nThe Labour leader also criticised plans to abolish the pensions allowance limit as \"a huge giveaway\" for the wealthy.\n\nBut Jeremy Hunt said the UK would avoid entering a recession and the economy was \"proving the doubters wrong\".\n\nThe government's independent forecaster said the economy was still likely to shrink this year, but by less than it previously thought.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility", "their support.\n\n\"I never stopped, not even in the past few weeks,\" he said in the pre-recorded message, in which he appeared smartly dressed in a suit.\n\n\"I worked on the party's new structure and I'm ready to return to work with you and fight alongside you our fights for freedom.\"\n\nParty members clapped enthusiastically at the end of the speech and some could be seen holding back tears.\n\nThe message was filmed on Friday after relatives and doctors stopped the billionaire media tycoon from being discharged out of concern he would try to attend the party's two-day convention in Milan, according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.\n\nHe spent two weeks in intensive care before being moved to a general ward in mid-April.\n\nForza Italia was founded by Mr Berlusconi and he remains its leader after serving four terms as president. The party is a junior member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government but has been in decline in recent years.\n\nMr Berlusconi's latter years in power were overshadowed by sex and corruption scandals and he remains a divisive figure in Italian politics.\n\nEarlier this year, he was finally cleared of bribing young showgirls to lie about his notoriously raunchy \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nMr Berlusconi was elected to Italy's upper house, the Senate, last September but has repeatedly required hospital treatment and is rarely seen in public.\n\nHis recent return to hospital caused concern in Italy and politicians from across the spectrum have wished him well.\n\nSir Keir Starmer met with new local Labour leaders on Tuesday to discuss his party's plans\n\nSir Keir Starmer has asked Labour councillors to focus on easing living costs to capitalise on the party's local election results last week.\n\nThe Labour leader credited a \"single focus\" on the issue during the campaign for its strong showing, where it gained more than 500 councillors.\n\nThe result, he added, gave new local Labour leaders a \"duty to deliver\".\n\nMeanwhile, Rishi Sunak has insisted his five priorities remain the best way for the Tories to win back voters.\n\nThe prime minister is facing pressure to explain how he will improve the Conservatives' standing with voters ahead of the next general election, expected next year, after losing more than 1,000 councillors.\n\nLabour won control of 22 councils last week, after running a campaign focused on increased costs for households amid soaring inflation.\n\nThese new Labour local authorities have now been tasked with drawing up \"action plans\" to lower living costs within the next 100 days.\n\nAt a meeting with new Labour council leaders earlier, Sir Keir said he was \"absolutely convinced\" the issue was behind his party's gains, adding it had consistently come up on the doorstep during the campaign.\n\nAlthough councils have limited powers to change the economic forces behind rising prices, he said the plans could provide a \"blueprint\" for how his party could tackle the issue if it wins power nationally.\n\nIdeas raised by local leaders at the meeting included \"financial MOTs\" to help people claim the maximum amount of tax credit, and acting as a co-ordinator for local groups offering support.\n\nIn a possible hint of the party's focus ahead of the next election, the councils have also been tasked with reviewing local housing and development policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak has insisted that his promises to cut inflation, bring down NHS waiting lists and tackle small boats, are the best way to put his party back on track after the local election losses.\n\nSome Conservative MPs have privately suggested Mr Sunak is likely to need to go beyond reiterating his five priorities - outlined earlier this year - to improve the Tories' fortunes.\n\nBut he doubled down on Tuesday, telling reporters during a visit that his priorities were \"the right ones\" to win back voters and \"the country's priorities\".\n\n\"I know that's not going to happen overnight, but what I can tell people is we are working day and night to make their lives better,\" he added.\n\nConservative MP Justin Tomlinson said the results were \"devastating\" for his party, and should serve as a \"wake-up call for the party at all levels\".\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio, he criticised the party's pitch to voters, adding it lacked a \"coherent message\" and it felt like it had \"forgotten\" to launch its campaign.\n\n\"Before we know it, we'll be heading into the general election, and we need to be back on the front foot,\" he added.\n\n\"We actually need to show that determination and that fight, and set out those tangible reasons why people should vote for what would be an unprecedented fifth term in office.\"\n\nA number of workers at the RNLI have raised some concerns about sexist and bigoted behaviour at the organisation.\n\nInternal surveys from 2021 and 2022 on the attitudes of staff and volunteers working at the UK lifeboat charity cite sexism and bullying.\n\nThe documents, first reported by the Times, have been seen by the BBC.\n\nThe RNLI told the BBC it was sorry to anyone who had faced \"behaviours and actions that no one should have to tolerate\" and \"will act\".\n\nThe organisation, which has more than 30,000 staff and volunteers, had about 3,600 survey responses over two years, mostly positive comments.\n\nBut the survey results show concerns also included \"blame\" culture, misogyny, being overworked, and a lack of space to openly call out inappropriate behaviour.\n\nIn the 2022 survey, one female respondent recounts being \"repeatedly\" called sexist terms by male colleagues.\n\n\"I have not once felt like the RNLI supports women or minorities,\" she said, adding that she would not recommend it \"as an employer to anybody\".\n\nA comment in the previous year's survey described the level of sexism at RNLI stations and around the coast as \"abhorrent\".\n\n\"I have never been at a station/around a branch and not heard an inappropriate comment or joke regarding race, sex or sexual orientation\".\n\nMatters reported to senior members were \"not dealt with effectively and timely,\" the person said, leading to some individuals getting away with \"disgraceful behaviour\".\n\nA respondent to the 2022 survey said their mental health has been affected by many factors, including a lack of holding people to account, being overworked and \"awful misogyny\".\n\nBullying was mentioned in a number of survey responses. There were no specific examples given but a respondent to the 2022 poll talked about experiencing a \"culture of bullying and harassment\".\n\nBut colleagues were praised for being \"caring\" by many survey respondents, and one comment says the RNLI is \"very inclusive of everyone and the relationships in the team make it a great place to work\".\n\nThe RNLI's Code of Conduct says volunteers must not \"participate in any form of inappropriate behaviour or activity\", including bullying, harassment or unlawful discrimination.\n\nSue Barnes, RNLI's People Director, said: \"We are sorry to our volunteers and staff who have faced behaviours and actions that no one should have to tolerate.\n\n\"There is no place for misogynistic, sexist, and non-inclusive behaviours at the RNLI and we are committed to taking action and tackling such behaviour.\"\n\nShe added that it has a \"range of methods\" members can use to report unacceptable behaviour, including a whistleblowing reporting line.\n\n\"We know we have more work to do to ensure we become the truly inclusive lifesaving charity we strive to be,\" she said.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

It's a lot longer than you ever want it to be,\" Fowler said after his record round. \"It's been so worth it and now being back.\"\n\nWhile Fowler tied the US Open record with 10 birdies in his round to counter two bogeys, current Olympic champion Schauffele had eight birdies in a bogey-free round.\n\n\"It's a great start. I hit a lot of really good shots,\" said Schauffele, who like Fowler is yet to win a major. \"Rickie was just right in front of me and I was playing really good golf so thought I may as well just chase him down.\n\n\"You have to play hard here, dig your way around.\"\n\nFor a notoriously slow starter in the majors, McIlroy's 65 on the quirky par-70 layout represents a huge improvement for the Northern Irishman as he looks to end his nine-year wait for a fifth major.\n\nMcIlroy made five front-nine birdies - his best effort in majors - on the back of some explosive driving off the tee.\n\nAnd he played solid golf on the back nine, adding one more birdie before making his only mistake at the 18th - playing an air shot from the greenside rough before making an 11-foot putt to drop just one shot.\n\nJohnson came flying home with five birdies on his back nine but he too made a mistake on the 18th.\n\nHe missed the par-three ninth green by a good 20 yards and his ball plunged into a bunker by the 18th green. He took three from there to drop his only shot of the day and finish two off the lead.\n\n\"The golf course is in perfect condition,\" said Johnson. \"I really like it. You just have to drive it well or you have no chance.\n\n\"The course was set up really nicely. I would imagine the next few days you're going to see the golf course set up as hard as they want to.\"\n\nScheffler, DeChambeau and best of the rest\n\nWorld number one Scheffler bookended his round with a bogey on the first and last, but found a spark around the turn with five birdies in eight holes to card a creditable 67.\n\nThat scored was matched by 2020 US Open champion DeChambeau, who had an eventful round with six birdies and three bogeys.\n\nLocal favourite Max Homa, who was born in Los Angeles and holds the course record of 61, is just a shot further back on two under while Viktor Hovland is one under after a round of highs and lows that included a hole-out eagle from 175 yards and a double-bogey seven.\n\nNorwegian Hovland, 25, has come close in the past three majors, playing in the final groups in both last year's Open Championship and last month's US PGA Championship.\n\nReigning Masters champion Rahm looked largely frustrated with three birdies and two bogeys in his one-under 69.\n\nThe Spaniard has a great record in California, with five of his PGA Tour wins coming in the state - including his 2019 US Open victory at Torrey Pines in nearby San Diego.\n\nJordan Smith is the leading Englishman after shooting a level-par 70 that featured five bogeys and five birdies, while defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick headed to the practice range after signing for a 71.\n\u2022 None Are you in need of a good night's sleep?

Mr Hamada said he could not confirm whether the missile flew over Japan's exclusive economic zone.\n\nSchools in Hokkaido delayed their start times and some train services were suspended, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Pyongyang's repeated missile launches pose a \"grave and imminent threat\" to Japan's security.\n\nUS National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the latest launch \"needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilising the security situation in the region\".\n\nThis latest launch came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his military to adopt a \"more practical and offensive\" manner in war deterrence, as reported by its state media agency KCNA.\n\nFor the past week, North Korea has not been answering twice-daily phone calls from South Korea, which has concerned the government in Seoul.\n\nThe two Koreas typically exchange calls at 09:00 and 15:00 local time (00:00 and 06:00 GMT) via a military hotline - these daily check-ins are intended to prevent clashes along the countries' border.\n\nEarlier this week, South Korea's Unification Minister Kwon Young-se described the North's suspension of communication as \"unilateral and irresponsible\".\n\n\"Pyongyang's provocations continue past its protest of US-South Korea defence exercises because Kim Jong-un hasn't finished demonstrating his nuclear delivery capabilities yet,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul,\n\n\"However, with the North Koreans literally not answering the phone, the lack of hotlines and diplomacy increases the risk of unintended escalation,\" he said.\n\nThis is an important week for North Korea as it celebrates Mr Kim's 11th year in power - the country tends to mark these anniversaries with displays of military progress.\n\nNorth Korea has been working to increase its nuclear arsenal and build ever-more sophisticated weapons. It has also criticised joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, accusing them of escalating tensions.\n\nThe latest missile launch also comes two days before the", "such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access.\n\nOfcom says it is also urging TalkTalk and O2 to introduce social tariffs in the broadband and mobile markets respectively.\n\nAround 4.3 million UK households could be getting cheaper broadband, but only around 220,000 people - or 5% of households - are currently signed up to the offer, according to Ofcom.\n\nConsumer groups are urging customers to act now and look at the packages available - especially given the cost of living crisis.\n\nAs well as being much more affordable, social tariffs are usually on shorter-term contracts. Plus there are no early exit fees - so people are not tied to the contract if their circumstances change, and you can leave without paying a penalty.\n\nAccording to Ofcom's affordability tracker one in three UK households had an issue affording their communication services, reflecting the ongoing pressures that people are facing.\n\nOfcom says more than half of eligible households continue to be unaware of social tariffs and that more needs to be done to encourage people to get the support - a similar plea was made last year.\n\nThe watchdog is concerned that broadband providers are still not being upfront with millions of customers about how to find and sign up to these packages.\n\nOf eligible customers that are aware of social tariffs, most had heard about them through social media and from television.\n\nBut just 9% found out about social tariffs through their provider. Ofcom says that highlights how the industry needs to go further to promote their social tariffs effectively and make them easier to find.\n\nLindsey Fussell, Ofcom's director of network and communication, said she believed broadband providers should go further, \"at a time when these savings could make a massive difference\".\n\n\"We're urging anyone who thinks they could be eligible for a discount deal to contact their provider today and potentially save hundreds of pounds,\" she said.\n\nEver since this row kicked off, I've wondered whether the prime minister had heard about Baroness Hallett's reputation.\n\nIf there were a national prize for Least Likely To Be A Pushover, this tough no-nonsense former Court of Appeal judge would probably win it. Here's why.\n\nThirteen years ago, Lady Justice Hallett, as she then was, oversaw the heart-breaking inquests into the 2005 suicide attacks in London, in which 52 people were killed by four bombers.\n\nMI5 and the Home Office tried to convince her to keep secret what spooks had known about the ringleader of the attacks. I oversimplify, but after some legal trench warfare, Hallett ruled that the bereaved families must know the facts.\n\nMI5's attempt to overturn that decision in the High Court, with the help of the then Home Secretary Theresa May, was so thin that a judge declared part of their argument to be \"hopeless\" .\n\nLady Justice Hallett had called the law right: there is inevitably a place for confidentiality or secrecy when it comes to sensitive national secrets. But there must also be transparency for the victims of an appalling tragedy.\n\nAnd in the aftermath, ministers found themselves accused of a spectacularly clumsy attempt to cover up the truth. I'll leave you to decide whether that sounds familiar...\n\nA multi-million pound fraudster has pleaded guilty to a sophisticated banking scam called iSpoof which stole \u00a3100m from victims worldwide.\n\nLast year the Metropolitan Police texted 70,000 people to warn them their details had been compromised and they had likely been defrauded.\n\nThe fraudsters called people at random, pretending to be a bank warning of suspicious activity on their accounts.\n\nThey would pose as employees of banks including Barclays, Santander, HSBC, Lloyds, Halifax, First Direct, NatWest, Nationwide and TSB.\n\nThe fraudsters would encourage people to disclose security information and, through technology, may have accessed features such as one-time passcodes to clear accounts of funds.\n\nThis is the largest fraud investigation the Metropolitan Police have ever carried out. In the UK alone \u00a343m was lost. One victim lost \u00a33m.\n\nFletcher, 35, of Western Gateway in east London, pleaded guilty to running the iSpoof website which allowed criminals and fraudsters to pretend to be banks and tax offices.\n\nHe admitted charges of making or supplying articles for use in fraud, encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, possessing criminal property and transferring criminal property.\n\n\"He was the ringleader of a slick fraud website which enabled criminals to defraud innocent people of millions of pounds,\" said Det Supt Helen Rance, who led the investigation.\n\n\"We are doing more than ever before to protect Londoners from spoofing and cyber fraud and devised a bespoke plan to reach out to victims who were targeted via iSpoof.\"\n\nLast year, when the fraud emerged, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the Met was contacting mobile numbers connected to the fraudsters for longer than a minute, suggesting a fraud or attempted fraud had taken place.\n\nCriminals paid Fletcher for access to his iSpoof website, transferring up to \u00a35,000 a month in Bitcoin. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US took the site down last year.\n\nFletcher will be sentenced on 18 May at Southwark Crown Court.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. We've got to double down and stick to our plan - Sunak\n\nThis set of by-elections amounts to a single question: just how badly did the Conservatives do?\n\nBut not as badly as they had feared.\n\nThe prospect of a crushing three-nil defeat - beaten everywhere - was averted.\n\nLabour managed to win - and win really big - in rural North Yorkshire; the kind of spot some distance from usually fertile political territory for them.\n\nAnd yet they lost in north west London, where they had expected to win.\n\nBut, but, but: the Tory obliteration in Somerset will sow panic among many Conservatives in the south west of England.\n\nSo let's unpick where this leaves us, because on the face of it is a rather messy picture.\n\nTo what extent were these contests atypical, by-election quirks rather than true indicators of the national mood?\n\nFirstly, Labour's victory in Selby and Ainsty is off the scale big.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Sir Keir Starmer on by-election win: Starmer: \"First time I have been able to say: Well done Keir\"\n\nAnother Keir joins the ranks of Labour MPs, Keir Mather. It's a name rich in Labour history: Keir Hardie was the party's first leader.\n\nIf Labour won on this scale nationally, they would be in government with a colossal majority.\n\nThe party that has campaigned so fruitfully for so long on the perceived failings of Boris Johnson has failed to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the very seat he used to represent.\n\nJust days ago, the Conservatives were ready to blame what they described privately as \"Long Boris\" to explain away their losses.\n\nIn other words, don't blame us, blame the prime minister before last.\n\nBut now they have won where he was the MP, and lost in two places where he wasn't.\n\nDowning Street had not anticipated a photo opportunity where smiles would feature today.\n\nBut before some of us had reached for the breakfast cereal Rishi Sunak was beaming in Uxbridge.\n\nAnd his message is one we will keep hearing, I suspect: the general election is not a done deal, and where voters see what he will claim is the \"reality of Labour\" they vote Conservative.\n\nTo hear Conservatives this morning talking about Uxbridge was to hear those swimming through the roughest of rough political seas, and then seeing an unlikely raft upon which to climb, and breathe a brief sigh of relief.\n\nLabour are disappointed to lose in Uxbridge.\n\nPublicly, and more candidly in private, they blame the expansion of London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a policy idea blamed by many voters on the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.\n\n\"If you run on a ticket about the cost of living but", "Family campaign, which ran in news bulletins in two local areas of the UK.\n\n\"The series is the latest in our tradition of local campaign journalism, which helps people who feel unheard have a voice. We are confident in our journalism and are committed to helping Ofcom with its investigation.\"\n\nJustice Secretary Alex Chalk this month said he was committed to proposals to introduce legislation so that convicted criminals would have to appear in court for their sentencing.\n\nSpeaking to ITV News, he said he was \"looking at what levers are open to us - whether you're talking about physically forcing people to court, or giving people an additional sentence as a result. We are looking very hard at this.\"\n\nIt comes after the killer of Zara Aleena in east London, Jordan McSweeney, refused to attend his sentencing, something her family described as \"a slap in the face\".\n\nThomas Cashman would not face the family of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel either, as he was jailed for life for her murder in Liverpool.\n\nThe historic criminal indictment against former US President Donald Trump has sparked another partisan flashpoint in an already deeply polarised nation.\n\nAhead of his court appearance next Tuesday, voters have been sharing with the BBC their strongly felt reactions to the first prosecution of a former president.\n\nWhatever their political affiliation, most of our voter panel agreed that the unprecedented case leaves the US in uncharted waters.\n\nThis is an excellent example of the politicisation of the judiciary. It's a huge mistake. Banana republic style vindictiveness. It's, in my opinion, totally undermining our rule of law and sets the US up for real trouble ahead. It's a huge mess and completely destructive.\n\nThis action taken by the New York district attorney destroys any respect for the rule of law that many in the public had. It does not inspire trust or confidence in our system. It is very worrisome.\n\nAgain, can't stress it enough - it's a huge mistake and the ramifications are going to be deep and far reaching. I worry for the times ahead in our country. We're heading into turbulent times and our institutions and customs will be tested like we've never seen before. I hope our republic can survive - all because of a vindictive and petty, hypocritical step by a 'smallish' prosecutor in New York.\n\nThis is one of many things that he should be charged with, and more presidents should be charged with more wrongdoing than just Trump.\n\nI think that denying prosecution of a public or political figure is itself an inherently political move. Presidents should absolutely be held to the same - or higher standards - of public scrutiny and lawful consequences.\n\nHe should absolutely face prosecution. I genuinely think that the battle lines in the country have already been drawn. I think that people have made up their minds about Trump. They love him or hate him and I don't see that changing.\n\nI feel they want to put a 'stain' on Donald Trump's character - as no other president has been criminally charged in our US history.\n\nI am surprised that they actually indicted him. This looks very bad for our country and for Trump to run in 2024. The news will focus on this more than anything that Trump has accomplished, and it will have a negative impact on Trump's run for 2024.\n\nI'm saddened to see this happen and do not agree with the Manhattan jury. I hope Trump can pick a good running mate - he is going to need it.\n\nThese are indeed uncharted times we are embarking on. Living in the New York area, we are a bit on guard but overall I believe these growing pains are necessary for us as a country to affirm who we are - a country where no-one is above the law.\n\nIt's hard to find a person who believes the former president didn't break laws, they simply debate whether he should be charged, which in itself says a lot about the vulnerability of our democracy right now.\n\nFor me, it's a naked and blatantly gross breach of responsibility by the Manhattan district attorney that goes beyond anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It is an embarrassment that in this country, things have gotten to the point where an extreme stretch in interpretation of the law could be used in an attempt to take out a political opponent.\n\nThis is the stuff of banana republics and countries that have been or are under the control of dictatorial power. Moreover, I think the Manhattan district attorney, with all that is on his plate with regards to crime in his jurisdiction, is so out of touch to want to go after a former president instead of focusing on the immediate needs of his electorate.\n\nI predict this will come back to haunt Biden in the 2024 election cycle that is just now getting underway - look for Republicans to pull all the stops going after the president and his son in their investigations.\n\nI'm glad that the law applies to everyone. I look forward to him having to answer for himself and let a jury decide. I'm comfortable letting the system do it's job.\n\nI'm also really sad that this day has come to the US. The fact that this took a long time to happen is good - this wasn't some rush to achieve a pre-defined objective. I'm also hoping Trump is healthy at least long enough to see this to its conclusion.\n\nI also think that if Trump could watch Michael Cohen get convicted for campaign finance crimes he committed for him, it will likely make it easier to prove that there was in fact a federal crime connected to the money. I'm sure Cohen will feel vindicated.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man has been arrested after one person was left in a life-threatening condition and another was injured in a stabbing attack at a London hospital.\n\nPolice said the man arrested at Central Middlesex Hospital in Park Royal also sustained \"self-inflicted\" injuries.\n\nThe hospital was temporarily locked down but has since reopened with a heightened police presence.\n\nOne witness described how patients and visitors were locked in a nurses' room while police dealt with the incident.\n\nStaff were evacuated from the hospital building, where officers will remain as searches are carried out.\n\nThe Met Police said it was satisfied no-one else was being sought and that the stabbings were not being treated as terror-related.\n\nThe attack was reported at about 13:20 BST. Paramedics said they treated three people at the scene.\n\nJamie Hogg, a contractor who saw the incident unfold, said he and his colleagues were visiting the hospital to carry out work and he saw police \"just swarming in\".\n\nStaff waited outside the hospital after being evacuated from the building\n\n\"It was armed police, one after another, one after another, and they just sprinted straight into the hospital,\" he said.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this before in my life, I thought it was crazy.

I get dizzy, I feel like something's happening in my head and I'm sweating.\n\n\"My whole body starts to do what my shoulder does and I'm convulsing. Either I feel like I'm going to be stuck like that forever or I'm going to die.\"\n\nHe can spend up to seven hours on the phone to his mum, Carol, as she tries to calm him down.\n\nTo Capaldi, those physical symptoms are a perfectly reasonable reaction to having his \"world turned upside down\".\n\n\"For me it's a like a completely normal reaction to this. If you are put in this situation, you are going to have something like this, especially if you are already an anxious person, which I guess I was.\n\n\"I didn't ever have the pressure that came to make me full blown but we are there now so we just need to deal with it.\"\n\nLewis Capaldi's debut, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, was the UK's biggest-selling album of 2019 and 2020\n\nA therapist has told him some of his issues relate to the death of two close relatives as a child, including the aunt whose suicide inspired Before You Go.\n\nIt feeds his anxieties about his own heath and mortality.\n\nCarol says her son - like everyone - is complicated: \"He's not just the comedian that we all think he is.\"\n\n\"And that's where the conflict possibly is as well,\" adds his dad, Mark. \"Because the darkness comes over the happy chappy guy and manifests itself in all the tics, the anxiety and all the other things that he's kind of surrounded in.\"\n\nDespite initially resisting the efforts of his family and friends to get treatment for his debilitating twitch, writing and recording for the second album was eventually put on hold for the sake of his mental health.\n\nThat's when he was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, a condition that causes people to make involuntary sounds or movements called tics.\n\nIt was a diagnosis that made \"complete sense\" to the singer and reassured the self-confessed hypochondriac that he was not dying.\n\nHe's been told that he will see a marked improvement if he can reduce his anxiety - something he is trying to do with medication, exercise and (relatively) healthy eating.\n\nLewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now is on Netflix.

Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry that \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".\n\nEngland's former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies was close to tears at the Covid Inquiry as she apologised to families bereaved by the pandemic.\n\n\"It wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died... it was harrowing and it remains horrible,\" she said.\n\nShe also said the UK did not have enough resilience to cope with the pandemic, with fewer doctors, nurses or hospital beds than similar countries.\n\nThe inquiry is currently examining the UK's preparedness ahead of Covid.\n\nIn her evidence, Dame Sally also expressed concern about the impact of the lockdowns on children and students.\n\n\"We have damaged a generation, and it is awful... watching these people struggle,\" she said.\n\nThe former chief medical officer told the inquiry the UK did not have plans in place to cope with a Covid pandemic, but she added \"it didn't have resilience either\".\n\nCompared with similar countries, the UK was at the bottom of the table for numbers of doctors, nurses, beds, IT units and ventilators per 100,000, she said.\n\nDuring questions about preparation exercises for pandemics, Dame Sally broke off to say: \"Maybe this is the moment to say how sorry I am to the relatives who lost their families.\"\n\n\"I heard a lot about it from my daughter who was on the front line as a doctor in Scotland,\" she added.\n\nDame Sally Davies became chief medical officer in 2010 and left in 2019 to be replaced by Sir Chris Whitty. He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.\n\nAt the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic.\n\nThe former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic.\n\nLast week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services.\n\nAsked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"\n\nHe accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.\n\n\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.\n\nHe said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending.\n\nDuring the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending.\n\nGeorge Osborne was quizzed on the impact of spending cuts\n\nMr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.\n\n\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\"\n\nThe British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\".\n\nOn Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid.\n\nDuring the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown.\n\nHe said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".\n\n\"There was no", "one male back inside to assist special forces operatives with a search.\n\nBut senior officers became concerned by the frequency with which the squadron's own accounts described detainees being taken back inside buildings and then grabbing for hidden weapons - an enemy tactic not reported by other British military forces operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThere were also concerns among officers that on a significant number of raids, there were more people killed than weapons reportedly recovered from the scene - suggesting the SAS was shooting unarmed people - and that SAS operatives might be falsifying evidence by dropping weapons at scenes after killing people.\n\nAfter similar concerns were raised in Australia, a judge-led inquiry was commissioned and found \"credible evidence\" members of Australian Special Forces were responsible for the unlawful killing 39 people, and used 'drop weapons' in an attempt to justify shootings.\n\nBy April 2011, the concerns were so great in the UK that a senior special forces officer wrote to the director of special forces warning that there was evidence of \"deliberate killing of individuals after they have been restrained\" and \"fabrication of evidence to suggest a lawful killing in self-defence\".\n\nTwo days later, the UK Special Forces assistant chief of staff warned the director that the SAS could be operating a policy to \"kill fighting-aged males on target even when they did not pose a threat.\"\n\nIf the suspicions were true, he wrote, the SAS squadron had \"strayed into indefensible ethical and legal behaviour\".\n\nThe SAS squadron operated in some of the most dangerous areas in southern Afghanistan, often raiding residential compounds in villages\n\nThe BBC visited several of the homes raided by the SAS squadron in 2010/11. At one, in a small village in Nad Ali in Helmand, there was a bricked up guesthouse where nine Afghan men including a teenager were killed in the early hours of 7 February 2011.\n\nThe SAS operatives arrived in helicopters under the cover of darkness and approached the house from a nearby field. According to their account, insurgents opened fire at them, prompting them to shoot back and kill everyone in the guesthouse.\n\nOnly three AK-47s were recovered, according to the SAS account - one of at least six raids by the squadron on which the reported number of enemy weapons was fewer than the number of people killed.\n\nInside the guesthouse, what appeared to be bullet holes from the raid were clustered together on the walls low to the ground. The BBC showed photographs from the scene to ballistics experts, who said that the clusters suggested multiple rounds had been fired downward from above, and did not appear indicative of a firefight.\n\nLeigh Neville, an expert on weapons used by UK Special Forces, said the bullet patterns suggested that \"targets were low to the ground, either prone or in a sitting or crouching position close to the wall - an unusual position if they were actively involved in a firefight\".\n\nThe same pattern was visible at two other locations examined by the BBC. Ballistics experts who reviewed images said the bullet holes were suggestive of execution-style killings rather than firefights.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an RMP investigator confirmed to the BBC that they had seen photographs from the scenes and that the bullet mark patterns had raised alarm.\n\n\"You can see why we were concerned,\" the investigator said. \"Bullet marks on the walls so low to the ground appeared to undermine the special forces' version of events.\"\n\nIn 2014, the RMP launched Operation Northmoor, a wide-ranging investigation into more than 600 alleged offences by British forces in Afghanistan, including a number of killings by the SAS squadron. But RMP investigators told the BBC that they were obstructed by British military in their efforts to gather evidence.\n\nOperation Northmoor was wound down in 2017 and eventually closed in 2019. The Ministry of Defence has said that no evidence of criminality was found. Members of the investigations team told the BBC they dispute that conclusion.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said British troops were held to the highest standards. \"No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a further statement, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to \"unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already been fully investigated\".\n\nIt said: \"We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute. Insinuating otherwise is irresponsible, incorrect and puts our brave Armed Forces personnel at risk both in the field and reputationally.\n\n\"The Ministry of Defence of course stands open to considering any new evidence, there would be no obstruction. But in the absence of this, we strongly object to this subjective reporting.\"\n\nShareholders in Credit Suisse have told the firm they feel \"failed\" and \"cheated\" after the collapsed bank was rescued by its long-time rival UBS.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 167-year old Swiss bank faced investors for the first time since the deal was struck and for the last time as an independent firm.\n\nCredit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was \"truly sorry\".\n\nBut one investor told the bank that shareholders had \"everything stolen from them\".\n\nCredit Suisse was rescued by UBS last month in a deal brokered by authorities after turmoil in the US banking sector sent the Swiss lender's shares tumbling.\n\nThe loss-making bank had already been struggling for a number of years after a series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets.\n\nMr Lehmann told investors at the Annual General Meeting that management had a plan to turn things around but had been \"thwarted\" by fears prompted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US.\n\nBut one shareholder suggested the board would have been crucified in medieval times.\n\nAnother held up a sack of empty walnut shells, saying they cost the same as a single Credit Suisse share.\n\nCredit Suisse's chief executive Ulrich Korner said: \"I understand that you feel disappointed, shocked, or angry.\n\n\"I share the disappointment of you, our shareholders, but I also share the disappointment of all of our employees, our clients and, ultimately, the general public.\"\n\nShareholders in both Credit Suisse and UBS - which will hold an investor meeting on Wednesday - have been denied a vote on the takeover because of the emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through.\n\nMr Lehmann said the only other option would have been bankruptcy.\n\n\"This would have led to the worst scenario, namely a total loss for shareholders, unpredictable risks for clients, severe consequences for the economy and the global financial markets,\" he said.\n\n\"It was our duty to protect the interests of our shareholders as best we could to provide security to our clients. We did everything we could within what was possible.\"\n\nCredit Suisse bosses knew they would have to eat humble pie at this meeting, but despite numerous apologies the shareholders remain angry.\n\nIt's common for middle-class Swiss people, especially the elderly, to invest money in a few shares as a back-up to their pensions. What have they traditionally considered safe? Switzerland's two biggest banks. But now Credit Suisse shares are worth less than 10% of what they were two years ago.\n\nOne man representing a group of shareholders accused Credit Suisse management of \"greed and incompetence\", another pointed to his red tie, saying he was wearing it to represent the \"red card\" Credit Suisse deserved.\n\nOthers turned their anger on the Swiss government, which forced through the takeover by UBS over just one weekend while the markets were closed. Some of us, said one shareholder, spend more time choosing our smartphones.\n\nVenting their anger is just about the only action the shareholders can take; the deal with UBS is done. Apologising again, CEO Ulrich Korner said there had been little choice, it was either take the deal with UBS or bankruptcy, which he said would have been catastrophic not just for Switzerland, but for the entire global economy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Girl survives being shot three times in Alabama\n\nA father has told the BBC he is \"absolutely crushed\" by the death of his 19-year-old son at a 16th birthday party in Alabama on Saturday night.", "ousses into products marketed as \"healthy\".\n\nThere have been questions about its potential harm over the past two decades.\n\nThen, last month, the World Health Organization said, although the evidence is not conclusive, it was concerned that long-term use of sweeteners like aspartame may increase the risk of \"type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and mortality\".\n\nAspartame is sometimes used to sweeten ice cream\n\nIn 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) decided - after looking at all the available evidence - that aspartame was safe. The UK's Food Standards Agency accepted this position.\n\nThe Committee on Toxicity looked at a study into aspartame in 2013 and concluded that the results \"did not indicate any need for action to protect the health of the public\".\n\nSix years later, Prof Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, decided to review the same evidence considered by EFSA - to see who had funded the different studies.\n\nHe discovered that 90% of the studies defending the sweetener were funded by large chemical corporations that manufacture and sell aspartame.\n\nAnd that all the studies suggesting that aspartame may cause harm were funded by non-commercial, independent sources.\n\nA spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation, a membership body for manufacturers, told the BBC that companies took \"the health of consumers, and safety of the food they produce, seriously - and adhere to the strict regulations\".\n\nA spokesperson for the International Sweeteners Association said: \"Low/no calorie sweeteners are safe to use, are amongst the most thoroughly researched ingredients in the world and have been approved by all major food safety bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"\n\nThe FSA says it will look into WHO's ongoing assessment of aspartame.

Greg Ead called the attack a \"devastating blow for the community\u201d\n\nA five-month-old baby has been taken to hospital after a dog attack, police have said.\n\nEmergency services were called to Penyrheol, Caerphilly county, on Saturday morning, Gwent Police said.\n\nThe baby was taken to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. The child's injuries are unknown but are not believed to be life-threatening.\n\nCaerphilly MP Wayne David said he was shocked by the incident, after two recent fatal dog attacks in the area.\n\nAll three incidents have happened within a half mile (about 0.8 km) radius of each other.\n\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed it was called to a dog attack at 09:00 BST.\n\nCaerphilly councillor, Greg Ead, said witnesses heard screams coming from the property at the time of the attack.\n\nLocal groups met on Thursday to discuss how to stop the rising numbers of attacks, with campaigners saying more needs to be done.\n\nPolice say they will be making further inquiries and will remain at the scene as the investigation continues\n\nGwent Police said officers seized the dog and confirmed no other animals were involved.\n\n\"We were called to an address in Penyrheol, Caerphilly at around 9.10am on Saturday 29 April, following reports of a dog attack,\" said the force.\n\n\"A five-month-old baby has been taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\n\n\"The dog was seized by officers. No other animals were involved in the attack.\"\n\nChief Insp Laura Bartley said officers would be making further inquiries and would \"remain at the scene as the investigation progresses\".\n\n\"It is possible that you may see ongoing police activity in Caerphilly as part of this work, but please do not be alarmed.\n\n\"If you have concerns or information then please do stop and talk with us.\"\n\nPenyrheol councillor, Greg Ead, said his son was staying at his girlfriend's home on the same street where they heard and shouts and screams.\n\nMr Ead called the attack \"traumatic\" for everyone on the road.\n\n\"I think another death would be absolutely devastating for this community,\" he said.\n\nThe incident comes after", "ic and Legal Medicine says he was \"likely to have bought heroin and not known it was laced with xylazine and fentanyl\".\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first death associated with xylazine use reported in the UK, and even Europe, and indicates the entry of xylazine into the UK drug supply,\" it adds.\n\nXylazine is used by vets as a powerful sedative but it's not approved for use in humans.\n\nKnown as \"tranq\" or \"tranq dope\" when cut with heroin and fentanyl by drug dealers, xylazine has been causing huge problems in the US.\n\nIf injected directly into someone's bloodstream, it can cause large open skin ulcers to form. These can start to rot and lead to amputation.\n\nIt also lowers breathing and heart rate to dangerously low levels, which has led to it being dubbed a \"flesh-eating zombie drug\".\n\nXylazine emerged on the illicit drug market in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s and has since been found in the US, mainly in the east, and in Canada.\n\nThe US government has called it \"an emerging threat\" because of its growing role in fatal overdoses across the country - about 7% of the total.\n\nAnd in some states, the drug was found in more than a quarter of overdoses.\n\nBut until now, there has been no sign of xylazine in the UK.\n\nThe drug was detected only because the Birmingham lab that carried out tests after the man's death noticed some strange results and identified xylaxine.\n\n\"The drug is not included in standard drug screens in the UK, so we don't know how widespread the xylazine problem is,\" said Dr Caroline Copeland, King's College London lecturer and director of the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths.\n\n\"We need to find out how that person ended up with it in his system.\"\n\nXylazine was listed on the man's death certificate as contributing to his death but there was no way of recording it in the UK drug-deaths database.\n\nThe report highlights the need to monitor changes in illicit-drug markets and in emerging drugs.\n\n\"There is no safe dose to use\", it concludes, because there is an overlap between fatal and non-fatal doses of xylazine reported in people.\n\nJames Gallagher wired up for the heatwave experiment\n\nSometimes it can feel like the world is on fire.\n\nEurope has been baking in a heatwave nicknamed the settimana infernale - \"week of hell\" - in Italy. Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just had its hottest ever June.\n\nAnd in 2022, the UK recorded a temperature above 40C for the first time. Last year's heatwave has been blamed for 60,000 deaths across Europe.\n\nIt's no wonder the United Nations has warned we now live in the era of \"global boiling\".\n\n\"I think it's really important to realise it's no longer just something that's distant or far away from us or something in the future. We are really seeing it now,\" says Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office.\n\nSo what does the changing climate mean for our bodies and our health?\n\nI tend to collapse into a sweaty puddle when it gets hot, but I've been invited to take part in a heatwave experiment.\n\nProf Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales wants to give me a typical heatwave encounter. So we're going to start at 21C, crank up the thermostat to 35C and then finally up to 40.3C - equivalent to the UK's hottest day.\n\n\"You will be sweating and your body's physiology is going to change quite considerably,\" Prof Bailey warns me.\n\nProf Bailey leads me into his environmental chamber. It's a room-sized piece of scientific equipment that can precisely control the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels inside this airtight space.\n\nI've been here once before to explore the effects of cold.\n\nBut the shiny steel walls, heavy door and tiny portholes take on new meaning in anticipation of the temperature being cranked up.\n\nI feel like I'm staring out of my oven.\n\nThe temperature starts at a perfectly pleasant 21C when the first instruction to \"completely strip everything off\" comes from Prof Bailey.\n\nIn response to a raised eyebrow, I'm reassured we're going to work out how sweaty I get, by seeing how my weight changes.\n\nJames getting wired up for the experiment inside the environmental chamber at the University of South Wales.\n\nNext, I'm connected to a dizzying array of gizmos tracking the temperature of my skin and my internal organs, my heart rate and blood pressure. A huge mouthpiece analyses the air I exhale and an ultrasound inspects the flow of blood to my brain through the carotid arteries in my neck.\n\n\"Blood pressure is working nicely, heart rate is working nicely, all of the physiological signals at the moment are telling me that you're in spiffing shape,\" Prof Bailey tells me.\n\nWe have one quick brain test to complete - memorising a list of 30 words - and then the fans kick in. The temperature is starting to rise.\n\nMy body has one simple goal - to keep the core temperature around my heart, lungs, liver and other organs at about 37C.\n\n\"The thermostat in the brain, or hypothalamus, is constantly tasting the temperature, then it sends out all of these signals to try to maintain that,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nWe take a pause at 35C to take some more measurements. It's warm in here now. It's not uncomfortable - I'm just relaxing in a chair - but I wouldn't want to work or exercise in this.\n\nProf Bailey is also feeling the heat inside the chamber\n\nSome changes in my body are already clear. I look redder. Damian does too, he's stuck in here with me. That's because the blood vessels near the surface of my skin are opening up to make it easier for my warm blood to lose heat into the air.\n\nAlso I'm sweating - not dripping, but positively glistening - and as the sweat evaporates, that cools me down.\n\nWe then plough on to 40.3C, and now I feel like the heat is pounding me.\n\n\"It's not linear, it's exponential. Five degrees centigrade [more] doesn't sound much, but it really is physiologically so much more of a challenge,\" Prof Bailey says.\n\nI'm glad we're not going higher. When I wipe my hand across my brow it is sodden. It's time to repeat the tests.\n\nWhen I chuck my sweaty clothes on the floor, towel off and climb back on the scales I'm shocked to learn I've lost more than a third of a litre's worth of water during the course of the experiment.\n\nThe cost of opening up all those blood vessels near my skin to lose heat is also clear. My heart rate has increased significantly and at 40C it is pumping an extra litre of blood per minute around my body than it was at 21C.\n\nThis extra strain on the heart is why there is an increase in deaths from heart attacks and strokes when temperatures soar.\n\nAnd as the blood heads to my skin, it's my brain that loses out. Blood flow goes down and so does my short-term memory.\n\nBut my body's main goal - keeping my core temperature at around 37C - has been achieved.\n\n\"Your body is working really quite nicely to try to defend that core temperature, but of course, the numbers are suggesting you weren't the same beast at 40 degrees as you were at 21 and that's in less than an hour,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nIn my experiment only the temperature was changed, but the other crucial factor to consider is the amount of water vapour in the air - the humidity.\n\nIf you've ever been really uncomfortable on a muggy night then you can blame the humidity as it impairs our body's ability to cool down.\n\nSweating alone isn't enough - it's only when the sweat evaporates into the air that it gives us that cooling effect.\n\nWhen", "has been plagued by rows between the Greens and the business-friendly liberals over climate change policies. But both parties do agree on migration: the liberals want workers for the economy; the Greens more human rights in migration policy.\n\nBut Friday's parliamentary debate about the law was ferocious. Conservatives voted against the bill, outraged that the new law would allow some rejected asylum seekers already here to find work.\n\nThe far-right AfD also voted no, saying that Germany was not a country of \"immigration\" but rather a \"homeland\", reflecting the party's increasingly nativist view of what it means to be German.\n\nThe AfD does not reflect mainstream society's view that Germany needs migrant workers. But despite this, or maybe because of it, the party is reaching unprecedented numbers in the polls.\n\nIn the latest ARD Deutschland Trend, the party reached 19% this week, the highest it has ever scored in this poll. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD party has slumped to 17%.\n\nThe political climate in Germany is polarised and febrile when it comes to migration. The government wants it, the economy needs it and parliament has now voted for it. But will all voters accept it?\n\nKing Charles III meets members of the public during his visit to Kinneil House, marking the first Holyrood Week since his coronation\n\nKing Charles III was greeted by crowds as he arrived in Scotland for a special week of events.\n\nHe met two Fair Queens in Bo'ness, Falkirk, before travelling to Edinburgh where he was presented with the keys to the city.\n\nEarlier a practice procession was held in the capital's Old Town ahead of a special ceremony of thanksgiving.\n\nKing Charles will be presented with the Scottish crown jewels during the event at St Giles' Cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nThe celebrations mark the first Holyrood Week since his coronation in May.\n\nAn early morning practice procession has been held in Edinburgh's Old Town\n\nAmong those who met the King on Monday was Bo'ness Fair Queen, Lexi Scotland, who was wearing her ceremonial robes and a crown.\n\nShe was joined by May Garrow, 99, who won the title in 1936.\n\nAfterwards Ms Garrow said: \"I've never actually shook hands with him before.

The report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nOn Monday, explosions in another part of Crimea were said by Ukraine to have destroyed Russian missiles being transported by rail.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that calling for a ceasefire before Russia withdrew \"would effectively be supporting the ratification of Russian conquest\".\n\nIn a joint news conference after talks with Mr Xi ended, Mr Putin said: \"Many provisions of the Chinese peace plan can be taken as the basis for settling of the conflict in Ukraine, whenever the West and Kyiv are ready for it.\"\n\nBut Russia had yet to see such \"readiness\" from the other side, he added.\n\nStanding alongside the Russian leader, Mr Xi said his government was in favour of peace and dialogue and that China was on the \"right side of history\".\n\nHe again claimed that China had an \"impartial position\" on the conflict in Ukraine, seeking to cast Beijing as the potential peace-maker.\n\nThe pair also discussed growing trade, energy and political ties between the two nations.\n\n\"China is the leading foreign trade partner of Russia,\" President Putin said, pledging to keep up and surpass the \"high level\" of trade achieved last year.\n\nMr Xi left Russia on Wednesday, his plane departing from a Moscow airport.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. China 'not impartial in any way', White House says\n\nAccording to Russian state media, the two leaders also:\n\nThere are growing concerns in the West that China might provide military support for Russia.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said his alliance had not \"seen any proof that China is delivering lethal weapons to Russia\".\n\nBut he added there were \"signs\" that Russia had requested weapons, and that the request was being considered in Beijing.\n\nA joint statement released by China and Russia after the meeting between the two leaders said the close partnership between the two countries did not constitute a \"military-political alliance\".\n\nRelations \"do not constitute a bloc, do not have a confrontational nature and are not directed against third countries\", they added.\n\nMr Putin also used the press conference to accuse the West of deploying weapons with a \"nuclear component\" and said Russia would be \"forced to react\" if the UK sent shells made with depleted uranium to Ukraine. .\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence said depleted uranium was a \"standard component\" which had \"nothing to do with nuclear weapons\".\n\nMr Xi was given a fanfare welcome when he arrived at the Kremlin for a second day of talks on Tuesday.\n\nHe said he was \"very happy\" to be in Moscow and described tal", "second burial that was found with a diagnostic stick pin from the 11th Century.\n\n\"And that suggests that there was an earlier Christian and potentially monastic foundation here which predates the Savigniac and Cistercian Abbey.\"\n\nBill Wolsey, managing director of Beannchor, said it was impossible to have foreseen what the project would entail at its outset in 2017.\n\n\"As time went on, we began to understand just how complex this project may be,\" he said.\n\nSkeletal remains unearthed at the site of a new hotel being developed by Belfast-based Beannchor Group in Dublin\n\n\"Great care has been taken to preserve and incorporate elements of these early surviving buildings into the new development, on what we now know is one of the most significant heritage sites in the city.\"\n\nThe new Bullitt Dublin hotel is expected to open in 2025.\n\nPresidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden smiled for the cameras at the G20 summit in November\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken's first visit to China comes nearly five months after a major rupture in relations over a Chinese spy balloon.\n\nHis original trip was abruptly cancelled because the balloon, which China says was monitoring weather, drifted across the continental US before being destroyed by American military aircraft.\n\nMr Blinken's visit includes meetings with China's top foreign policy officials but there is no word yet on whether he will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, who appeared with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in Beijing on Friday.\n\nThe two global superpowers have a long list of issues that concern them, including high-profile disagreements as well as potential areas of co-operation.\n\nHere are three key areas that could be at the top of the agenda.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mr Blinken's visit is about re-establishing diplomatic interactions of any kind.\n\nLast month there was an initial breaking of the ice when senior US officials met in Vienna, Austria.\n\nBut Mr Blinken is the most senior Biden administration official to travel to China, and it marks the first visit by a US secretary of state to Beijing since October 2018.\n\nNow is a good time to be talking again because that in itself reduces the risk of conflict, said Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell, in a pre-trip briefing.\n\n\"We can't let the disagreements that might divide us stand in the way of moving forward on the global priorities that require us all to work together.\"\n\nThe Chinese response to the Blinken visit has been somewhat frosty, however.\n\nIn the official Chinese account of a call with Mr Blinken on Wednesday night, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang is reported to have told him that \"it is very clear who is to blame\" for the recent deterioration in relations.\n\n\"The United States should respect China's concerns, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests in the name of competition,\" Mr Qin reportedly said.\n\nThe US has downplayed any significant announcements coming out of this visit. It seems the only \"deliverable\" from the meetings, in diplomatic parlance, will be that the meetings have happened at all.\n\nDon't expect some sort of breakthrough or transformation in the way that the two deal with one another, said Daniel J Kritenbrink, the State Department's senior East Asia diplomat.\n\nIf the meeting leads to further interaction between US and Chinese officials, that would be something both sides could build on.\n\nPresident Biden's relations with China started off on a rocky note, in part because he has been unwilling to cancel trade measures enacted by his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nThat includes billions of dollars in import tariffs on Chinese-made products.\n\nIn some areas, Mr Biden has squeezed even harder, with restrictions on US computer-chip exports to China in an effort to maintain US superiority in the most advanced electronics technologies.\n\nChina responded by enacting its own ban on computer memory chips sold by Micron, the largest US manufacturer.\n\nMr Campbell acknowledged China's concerns but said the US would defend and explain what it's done so far and what could lie ahead.\n\nIf computer technology is an area destined for fierce competition between the two superpowers, the illicit drug trade may provide more room for co-operation.\n\nThe US wants to limit the export of Chinese-produced chemical components used to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more powerful than heroin.\n\nThe rate of US drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl has more than tripled in the last seven years.\n\n\"This is an absolutely critical and urgent issue for the United States,\" said Mr Kritenbrink - but it is one that presents its own challenges.\n\nAfter the balloon incident, there were reports that China was considering sending weapons to Russia, where they would be immediately used in the war against Ukraine.\n\nUS government officials have backed away from those accusations of late, removing what could have been a particularly contentious issue for the two nations that risked turning the Ukraine-Russia conflict into a proxy war between the US and China.\n\nRemote Philippine islands are on the frontlines of US-China tensions\n\nBut expect Mr Blinken to echo warnings given to the Chinese in Vienna that there would be serious consequences if China gives military and financial assistance to Russia.\n\nUS and Chinese warships have been facing off in a high-stakes game of chicken over the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. China claims the area as their own, while the US insists they are international waters.\n\nMr Blinken and his diplomatic team have said that his goal in this trip is to \"de-risk\" the tensions, and renewed communication is the place to start.\n\nAchieving more may be a tall task for now - and more extensive co-operation could become more difficult for Mr Biden as anti-China rhetoric in Washington is sure to heat up when the 2024 presidential elections approach.\n\nA satisfactory outcome from this trip for both sides might be simply the opening of communication channels that prevent an incident leading to military conflict.\n\nPoppy Devey Waterhouse and Ellie Gould were murdered by their ex-boyfriends\n\nA barrister who led a review into how domestic killers are sentenced said she is \"disappointed\" her report has not been adopted in full.\n\nClare Wade recommended 17 reforms she said were needed to ensure justice for victims of abuse in serious cases.\n\nThe government is proceeding with some of them initially, including longer sentences for killers with a history of coercive control or extreme violence.\n\nJustice Secretary Dominic Raab said other proposals are being considered.\n\nMs Wade's report - published on Friday - recognised that the majority of people killed in domestic cases where there is a background of abuse are women attacked by men.\n\nIt was commissioned following the deaths of Ellie Gould 17, and Poppy Devey Waterhouse, 24, who were both stabbed to death in their homes by male partners.\n\nUnder the government's plans, judges will be required by law to consider a history of coercive or controlling behaviour as an aggravating factor when deciding on a jail term, meaning those offenders will serve longer behind bars.\n\nChanges will also ensure judges hand down longer sentences where \"overkill\" - or excessive violence - has been used.\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he is committed to cracking down on violence against women - but the head of the review warned the proposals \"won't achieve the justice they are intended to achieve if they are all only implemented in part\".\n\nMs Wade was asked by the government in September 2021 to review sentencing guidelines after ministers were warned about \"systemic misogyny within the criminal justice system\" by the victims' commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner.\n\nShe said she was concerned the government is pressing ahead with making a history of controlling or coercive behaviour an aggravating factor - but without enshrining it in law as a mitigating factor for when victims who kill their abusers.\n\nMs Wade, who was the defence barrister for Sally Challen when she became the first woman to have her murder conviction quashed under coercive control laws, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's approach \"will make matters much worse for women who kill their abusive partners\".\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he was \"very sympathetic\" to the mitigation argument but insisted he would take time between now and the summer to", "record and make promises about a bright future for America if he is elected, it was clear that his legal troubles - and possible impending arrest - were foremost in his mind.\n\nThe ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre\n\nAn 88-year-old German man has been charged with involvement in one of the most infamous World War Two massacres.\n\nThe charges relate to Oradour-sur-Glane in central France, where 642 people were murdered by SS troops in 1944.\n\nMany were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire.\n\nProsecutors in Dortmund said the man had been charged over the murder of 25 people and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred.\n\nThe ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre, as a permanent memorial.\n\nFrench leader General Charles de Gaulle said it should be a reminder of the cruelty of the Nazi occupation.\n\nSome 60 soldiers were brought to trial in the 1950s. Twenty of them were convicted but all were later released.\n\nGerman investigators said last year they had opened a new inquiry into the massacre.\n\nOn Wednesday, the regional court in Cologne said: \"The prosecutor's office in Dortmund has charged an 88-year-old from Cologne over the murder of 25 people committed by a group, and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred people.\"\n\nThe man was named in documents as Werner C, a former member of an SS armoured division who was 19 at the time.\n\nHis lawyer, Rainer Pohlen, told the Associated Press news agency his client was at the village but had nothing to do with the massacre.\n\nDortmund state prosecutor Andreas Brendel said the accused was among six men still facing possible prosecution.\n\nOn 10 June 1944, a detachment of SS troops had surrounded the tiny hamlet in the Limousin region.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Almost half the electorate in this deeply polarised country did not back his authoritarian vision of Turkey.\n\nUltimately, Mr Kilicdaroglu was no match for the well-drilled Erdogan campaign, even if he took the president to a run-off second round for the first time since the post was made directly elected in 2014.\n\nBut he barely dented his rival's first-round lead, falling more than two million votes behind.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe president made the most of his victory, with an initial speech to supporters atop a bus in Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, followed after dark by a balcony address from his palace to an adoring crowd that he numbered at 320,000 people.\n\n\"It is not just us who won, Turkey won,\" he declared, calling it one of the most important elections in Turkish history.\n\nHe taunted his opponent's defeat with the words \"Bye, bye, Kemal\" - a chant that was also taken up by his supporters in Ankara.\n\nMr Erdogan poured scorn on the main opposition party's increase in its number of MPs in the parliamentary vote two weeks earlier. The true number had fallen to 129, he said, because the party had handed over dozens of seats to its allies.\n\nHe also condemned the opposition alliance's pro-LGBT policies, which he said were in contrast with his own focus on families.\n\nThe run-up to the vote had become increasingly rancorous and in one incident late on Sunday, an opposition Good party official was fatally stabbed in front of a party office in the northern coastal town of Ordu.\n\nThe motive for Erhan Kurt's killing was not clear, but a leading opposition official blamed youths celebrating the election result.\n\nAlthough the final results were not confirmed, the Supreme Election Council said there was no doubt who had won.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the palace complex to be opened to the public - but so was this result, extending his period in power to a quarter of a century.\n\nSupporters came from all over Ankara to taste the victory. There were Islamic chants, while some laid Turkish flags on the grass to pray.\n\nFor a night, Turkey's economic crisis was forgotten. One supporter, Seyhan, said it was all a lie: \"Nobody is hungry. We are very happy with his economy policies. He will do even better in the next five years.\"\n\nBut the president admitted that tackling inflation was Turkey's most urgent issue.\n\nThe question is whether he is prepared to take the necessary measures to do so. At an annual rate of almost 44%, inflation seeps into everyone's lives.\n\nThe cost of food, rent and other everyday goods has soared, exacerbated by Mr Erdogan's refusal to observe orthodox economic policy and raise interest rates.\n\nThe Turkish lira has hit record lows against the dollar and the central bank has struggled to meet surging demand for foreign currency.\n\n\"If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter capital controls,\" warns Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc university in Istanbul.\n\nEconomics was far from the minds of Erdogan supporters, who spoke of their pride at his powerful position in the world and his hard line on fighting \"terrorists\", by which they meant Kurdish militants.\n\nPresident Erdogan has accused his opposite number of siding with terrorists, and criticised him for promising to free a former co-leader of Turkey's second largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas has been languishing in jail since 2016, despite the European Court of Human Rights ordering his release.\n\nMr Erdogan said while he was in power, Mr Demirtas would stay behind bars.\n\nHe also promised to prioritise rebuilding in areas hit by February's twin earthquakes and bring about the \"voluntary\" return of a million Syrian refugees.\n\nCrowds f"]
