Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes' time.' \nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do. \nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. 'What does Dumbledore want?' Hermione said at once. 'Harry, are you OK?' she added anxiously. \n'I'm fine,' said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned. \n'I haven't got much time,' Harry panted, 'Dumbledore thinks I'm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...' \nQuickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione's gasps of horror or for Ron's hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later. \n'... so you see what this means?' Harry finished at a gallop. 'Dumbledore won't be here tonight, so Malfoy's going to have another clear shot at whatever he's up to. No, listen to me!\" he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. 'I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -' He shoved the Marauder's Map into Hermione's hand. 'You've got to watch him and you've got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he's put extra protection in the school, but if Snape's involved, he'll know what Dumbledore's protection is, and how to avoid it - but he won't be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?' \n'Harry -' began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. \n' ? haven't got time to argue,' said Harry curtly. Take this as well -' He thrust the socks into Ron's hands. \n\u2018Thanks,' said Ron. 'Er - why do I need socks?' \n'You need what's wrapped in them, it's the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. I'd better go, Dumbledore's waiting -' \n'No!' said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. 'We don't want it, you take it, who knows what you're going to be facing?' \n'I'Il be fine, I'll be with Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'I want to know you lot are OK ... don't look like that, Hermione, I'll see you later \nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall. \nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side. \n'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?' \nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant-ing and sweating rather a lot. \n'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape. \nThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Dumbledore lightly. 'I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog's Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one's true destination.' \nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering twi-light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid's cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. \n'Professor,' said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, 'will we be Apparating?' \n'Yes,' said Dumbledore. 'You can Apparate now, I believe?' \n'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I haven't got a licence.' \nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go? \n'No matter,' said Dumbledore, 'I can assist you again.' \nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. \n'- and stay out!' shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. 'Oh, hello, Albus ... you're out late ...' \n'Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, I'm off to the Hog's Head ... no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight...' \nA minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog's Head's sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty. \n'It will not be necessary for us to enter,' muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. 'As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one ... two ... three ...'\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com-pressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.\n\nChapter 26: The Cave\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. \n\"What do you think?\" asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry's opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. \n\"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?\" asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. \n\"Not here, precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?\" \nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. \n\"But his final destination \u2014 and ours \u2014 lies a little farther on. Come.\" \nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged", "PPL": 7.202823162078857, "PPL/lower": 1.0098474299838296, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020769386280504202, "Min-5%": 38.40357632730522, "Min-10%": 32.04390334148033, "Min-20%": 25.129847218762983, "Min-30%": 20.479219292196465, "Min-40%": 17.00108354598794, "Min-50%": 14.232198049129511, "Min-60%": 11.993946549485678}, {"text": "y. \"It's got to stay put.

I couldn't guarantee anything.\" \n  \n\"No?\" said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \"Perhaps this will make you more confident.\" \n  \nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. \n  \n\"Tell anyone,\" said Maifoy, \"and there will be retribution.

He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention.\" \n  \n\"There will be no need for \u2014\" \n  \n\"I'll decide that,\" said Malfoy. \"Well, I'd better be off. And don't forget to keep that one safe, I'll need it.\" \n  \n\"Perhaps you'd like to take it now?\" \n  \n\"No, of course I wouldn't, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street?

He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. \n  \n\"What was that about?\" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears. \n  \n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said 'that one'?\" \n  \n\"No, he was behind that cabinet \u2014\" \n  \n\"You two stay here,\" whispered Hermione. \n  \n\"What are you \u2014 ?\" \n  \nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry. \n  \n\"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?\" Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display. \n  \n\"Is this necklace for sale?\" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case. \n  \n\"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons,\" said Mr. \n  \nBorgin coldly. \n  \n\"Oh \u2014 er \u2014 no, I haven't got quite that much,\" said Hermione, walking on. \"And . . . what about this lovely \u2014 um \u2014 skull?\" \n  \n\"Sixteen Galleons.\" \n  \n\"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being . . . kept for anyone?\" \n  \nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the \n  \nwinds. \n  \n\"The thing is, that \u2014 er \u2014 boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he's a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he's already reserved anything, I obviously don't want to get him the same thing, so ... um ...\" \n  \nIt was a pretty lame story in Harry's opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too. \n  \n\"Out,\" he said sharply. \"Get out!\" \n  \nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign. \n  \n\"Ah well,\" said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. \"Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious \u2014\" \n  \n\"Well, next time you can show me how it's done, Master of Mystery!\" she snapped. \n  \nRon and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys' \n  \nWizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly. \n  \n  \n\nChapter 7: The Slug Club\n\n\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.\n\"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\" said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \"But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?\"\n\"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory\" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. \"Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\"\n\"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?\" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \"That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\"\n\"You reckon?\" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\n\"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \"Malfoy's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Malfoy\u2019d like revenge?\"\nRon looked up, blinking.\n\"Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\"\n\"That's my point, I don't know!\" said Harry, frustrated. \"But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ?quot;\nHarry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.\n\"Harry?\" said Hermione in an anxious voice. \"What's wrong?\"\n\"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?\" asked Ron nervously.\n\"He's a Death Eater,\" said Harry slowly. \"He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!\"\nThere was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \"Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?\"\n\"It seems very unlikely, Harry,\" said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. \"What makes you think ??\"\n\"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm.

He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.\n    'Sirius?' said Harry anxiously.\n    But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n    'Why did he - ?'\n    Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n    A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.\n    The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.\n- CHAPTER EIGHTEEN -\nDumbledore's Army\n'Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There's no other explanation.'\n    'You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?' he said, outraged.\n    'I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly. 'Watch your frog, it's escaping.'\n    Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table - 'Accio!' - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.\n    Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.\n    'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered. 'I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all - it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? Harry, you're squashing your frog.'\n    Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.\n    'It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione. 'I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silendo.'\n    The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.\n    'If she'd caught Snuffles - '\n    Harry finished the sentence for her.\n    ' - He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.' He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.\n    'Silencio!' said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them. 'Well, he mustn't do it again, that's all. I just don't know how we're going to let him know. We can't send him an owl.'\n    'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron. 'He's not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio.'\n    The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.\n    'Silencio. SILENCIO!'\n    The raven cawed more loudly.\n    'It's the way you're moving your wand,' said Hermione, watching Ron critically, 'you don't want to wave it, it's more a sharp jab.'\n    'Ravens are harder than frogs,' said Ron through clenched teeth.\n    'Fine, let's swap,' said Hermione, seizing Ron's raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. 'Silencio!' The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.\n    'Very good, Miss Granger!' said Professor Flitwick's squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron and Hermione all jump. 'Now, let me see you try, Mr Weasley'\n    'Wha-? Oh - oh, right,' said Ron, very flustered. 'Er - silencio!'\n    He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye: the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk.\n    It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.\n    They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody's head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students.\n    'I've got permission!' she said. To re-form the Quidditch team!'\n    'Excellent!' said Ron and Harry together.\n    'Yeah,' said Angelina, beaming. 'I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore. Anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o'clock tonight, all right, because we've got to make up time. You realise we're only three weeks away from our first match?'\n    She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first-year instead, and vanished from sight.\n    Ron's smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.\n    'Hope this clears up. What's up with you, Hermione?'\n    She, too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.\n    'Just thinking . . .' she said, still frowning at the rain-washed window.\n    'About Siri - Snuffles?' said Harry.\n    'No . . . not exactly . . .\" said Hermione slowly. 'More . . . wondering . . . I suppose we're doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren't\n    Harry and Ron looked at each other.\n    'Well, that clears that up,' said Ron. 'It would've been really annoying if you hadn't explained yourself properly.'\n    Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there.\n    'I was just wondering,' she said, her voice stronger now, 'whether we're doing the right thing, starting this Defence Against the Dark Arts group.'\n    'What?' said Harry and Ron together.\n    'Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!' said Ron indignantly.\n    'I know,' said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. 'But after talking to Snuffles . . .'\n    'But he's all for it,' said Harry.\n    'Yes,' said Hermione, staring at the window again. 'Yes, that's what made me think maybe it wasn't a good idea after all . . .'\n    Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed.\n    'Let's get this straight,' said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, 'Sirius agrees with us, so you don't think we should do it any more?'\n    Hermione looked tense and rather miserable.

He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Proiessor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him.\n    'Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,' said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. 'What d'you reckon that means?'\n    'Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,' said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.\n    'D'you realise how much homework we've got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we've got a month's dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren't wrong about OWL year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .'\n    When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teachers desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.\n    The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.\n    'Well, good afternoon!' she said, when finally the whole class had sat down.\n    A few people mumbled 'good afternoon' in reply.\n    'Tut, tut,' said Professor Umbridge. 'That won't do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply \"Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge\". One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!'\n    'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,' they chanted back at her.\n    There, now,' said Professor Umbridge sweetly. That wasn't too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.'\n    Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order 'wands away' had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill, ink and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:\nDefence Against the Dark Arts\nA Return to Basic Principles\n'Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn't it?' stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your OWL year.\n    'You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.'\n    She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by the 'Course Aims'.\n1.\tUnderstanding the principles underlying defensive magic.\n2.\tLearning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally\nhe used\n3.\tPlacing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.\nFor a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge's three course aims she asked, 'Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?'\n    There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.\n    'I think we'll try that again,' said Professor Umbridge. 'When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply, \"Yes, Professor Umbridge\", or \"No, Professor Umbridge'. So: has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?'\n    'Yes, Professor Umbridge,' rang through the room.\n    'Good,' said Professor Umbridge. I should like you to turn to page five and read \"Chapter One, Basics for Beginners\". There will be no need to talk.'\n    Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher's desk, observing them all closely with those pouchy toad's eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.\n    It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.\n    Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her enquiringly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.\n    After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye rather than struggle on with 'Basics for Beginners'.\n    When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.\n    'Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?' she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.\n    'Not about the chapter, no,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, we're reading just now,' said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth. 'If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.'\n    'I've got a query about your course aims,' said Hermione.\n    Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.\n    'And your name is?'\n    'Hermione Granger,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully' said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.\n    'Well, I don't,' said Hermione bluntly. There's nothing written up there about using defensive spells.'\n    There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.\n    'Using defensive spells?' Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. 'Why, I can't imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren't expecting to be attacked during class?'\n    'We're not going to use magic?' Ron exclaimed loudly.\n    'Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr - ?'\n    'Weasley,' said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.\n    Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back or. him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge's pouchy eyes lingerec. on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.\n    'Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?'\n    'Yes,' said Hermione. 'Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practise defensive spells?'\n    'Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?' asked Professor Umbridge, in her falsely sweet voice.\n    'No, but - '\n    'Well then, I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the \"whole point\" of any class is.

The Wizengamot fell silent again.\n    'We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,' he said, 'other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.'\n    Fudges plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, 'We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly - '\n    'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.\n    'True,' said Madam Bones. 'Perfectly true.'\n    'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge. 'Where is this person?'\n    'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore. 'She's just outside the door. Should I - ?'\n    'No - Weasley, you go,' Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.\n    A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.\n    Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.\n    'Full name?' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.\n    'Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice.\n    'And who exactly are you?' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice\n    'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg.\n    'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.'\n    'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs Figg. 'So you wouldn't have me registered, would you?'\n    'A Squib, eh?' said Fudge, eyeing her closely. 'We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors?' he added, looking left and right along the bench.\n    \"Yes, we can!' said Mrs Figg indignantly.\n    Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. 'Very well,' he said aloofly. 'What is your story?'\n    'I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,' gabbled Mrs Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, 'when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running - '\n    'Running?' said Madam Bones sharply. 'Dementors don't run, they glide.'\n    'That's what I meant to say,' said Mrs Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. 'Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.'\n    'What did they look like?' said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh.\n    'Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny - '\n    'No, no,' said Madam Bones impatiently. 'The Dementors . . . describe them.'\n    'Oh,' said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\n    Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . .\n    In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded.\n    'Big and wearing cloaks,' repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. 'I see. Anything else?'\n    'Yes,' said Mrs Figg. 'I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . .'\n    Her voice shook and died.\n    Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.\n    'What did the Dementors do?' she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.\n    They went for the boys,' said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. 'One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that . . . that is what happened,' Mrs Figg finished, somewhat lamely.\n    Madam Bones looked down at Mrs Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, That's what you saw, is it?'\n    That is what happened,' Mrs Figg repeated.\n    'Very well,' said Fudge. 'You may go.'\n    Mrs Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.\n    'Not a very convincing witness,' said Fudge loftily.\n    'Oh, I don't know,' said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. 'She certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't.'\n    'But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?' snorted Fudge. The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn't have bet - '\n    'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly.\n    The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shade w, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent.\n    'And what is that supposed to mean?' Fudge asked icily.\n    'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore.\n    'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!' barked Fudge.\n    'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.'\n    'Yes, you have,' said Fudge forcefully, 'and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore.

It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was\n28\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure\nthey didn't fail. He had a plan.\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\ntime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\n29\nHarry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\nI want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\"\n\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\"\n\"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\nback doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\nto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty\n30\nletters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\n\"Out! OUT!\"\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\"\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake'em off... shake 'em\noff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\nThey didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?

But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before.

Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \n  \n\"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world \u2014 hidden \u2014 buried or invisible \u2014\" \n  \n\"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack \u2014 the piece that lives in his body.\" \n\"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \n\"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \n  \n\"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \n  \n\"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been \u2014 forgive me the lack of seemly modesty \u2014 for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \n  \n\"But how did you find it?\" \n\"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt\u2019s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \n\"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \n\"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \n  \n\"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \n  \n\"The diary wasn't that special.\" \n  \n\"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance.\" \n  \n\"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \n  \n\"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \n  \n\"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\" \n  \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet \u2014 perhaps not my other hand \u2014 but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" \n  \nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \n  \n\"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \n  \n\"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two \u2014 he may have found three \u2014 that is the best we can do for now.\" \n  \n\"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he\u2019s got both?\" \n  \n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' \n  \n\"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \n  \n\"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \n  \n\"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \n  \n\"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \n  \n\"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir?

In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. \n  \nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort.

He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. \n  \n\"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. \n  \n\"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!\" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah ...\" \n  \nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. \n  \n\"Help yourself, Tom,\" said Hepzibah, \"I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ...\" \n  \nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. .|,! \n  \n\"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?\" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. \n  \n\"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair \u2014\" \n  \n\"Now, now, not so fast, or I\u2019ll think you're only here for my trinkets!\" pouted Hepzibah. \n  \n\"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire \u2014\" \n  \n\"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.\" \n  \n\"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. \n  \n\"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ...\" \n  \n\"Here, madam,\" squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools. \n  \n\"Now,\" said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, \"I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this!\" \n  \nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. \n  \n\"I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!\" whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah\u2019s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort's handsome features. \n\"A badger,\" murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \"Then this was . . . ?\" \n  \n\"Helga Hufflepuff 's, as you very well know, you clever boy!\" said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \"Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .\" \n  \nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away. \n  \n\"Now then,\" said Hepzibah happily, \"where\u2019s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are \u2014 take that away now, Hokey.\" \n  \nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. \n\"I think you'll like this even more, Tom,\" she whispered. \"Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. ...\" \n  \nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. \n  \nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \n  \n\"Slytherin's mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S. \n  \n\"That's right!\" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \"I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value \u2014\" \n  \nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain. \n  \n\"\u2014 I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . .", "PPL": 7.452521324157715, "PPL/lower": 1.0004575621360803, "PPL/zlib": 0.00234356016482947, "Min-5%": 38.3486000696818, "Min-10%": 32.649483839670815, "Min-20%": 26.072783192678884, "Min-30%": 21.345074220278363, "Min-40%": 17.667964298159685, "Min-50%": 14.75880293296113, "Min-60%": 12.414780764291457}, {"text": "is Mad-Eye?\" asked Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's retired, used to work at the Ministry,\" said Charlie. \"I met him once when Dad took me into work with him.

Oh dear, they don't look happy, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster's Fabulous No-Heat, Wet-Start Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred's trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg.\n\u3000\u3000The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it. . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\n\u3000\u3000\"I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\" said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Fred keenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll see,\" said Charlie. \"Just don't tell Percy I mentioned it.. . it's 'classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,' after all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,\" said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said George impatiently.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to have an interesting year,\" said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \"I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit of what?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh it was my pleasure, dears,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"I'd invite you for Christmas, but...well, I expect you're all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with. . . one thing and another.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum!\" said Ron irritably. \"What d'you three know that we don't?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll find out this evening, I expect,\" said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. \"It's going to be very exciting - mind you, I'm very glad they've changed the rules -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What rules?\" said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won't you? Won't you, Fred? And you, George?\"\n\u3000\u3000The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts!\" Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. \"What rules are they changing?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon's cage to muffle his hooting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts,\" he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \"At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won't say. Wonder what --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore - the man's such a Mudblood-lover - and Durmstrang doesn't admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?\" she said angrily. \"I wish he had gone, then we wouldn't have to put up with him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Durmstrang's another wizarding school?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Hermione sniffily, \"and it's got a horrible reputation. According to An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think I've heard of it,\" said Ron vaguely. \"Where is it? What country?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, nobody knows, do they?\" said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - why not?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools.

Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. \n\u201cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. \u201cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don\u2019t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\"\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way\nback to London than tell Snape why he was late.\n\u201cI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?\" Snape\ncontinued. \"And with no flying car available you decided that\nbursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to\ncreate a dramatic effect.\"\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might\nexplode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for\nthe few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without\nanyone else listening.\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, \"No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure.\"\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was ail a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, .mil forced his way in between them.\n\"Where've you \u2014 blimey, what've you done to your face?\" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I\n\"Why, what's wrong with it?\" said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\n\"You're covered in blood!\" said Hermione. \"Come here \u2014\"\nShe raised her wand, said \"Tergeo!\" and siphoned off the dried blood.\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \"How's my nose looking?\n\u201cNormal,\" said Hermoine anxiously. \"Why shouldn't it? Harry, what happened? We've been terrified!\"\n\u201cI'll tell you later,\" said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.\n\u201cBut \u2014\" said Hermione.\n\u201cNot now, Hermione,\" said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn't reach too many Gryffindor ears.\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.\n\u201cYou missed the Sorting, anyway,\" said Hermione, as Ron dived a largt: chocolate gateau. \n\u201cHat say anything interesting?\" asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\n\u201cMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.\" \n\u201cDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?\" Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesn't he?

How come?\" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\n\"Bumped into him,\" said Harry evasively.\n\"Hagrid was only a few minutes late,\" said Hermione. \"Look, he's waving at you, Harry.\"\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid's other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry's parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Malfoy one-on-one...\n\"So what did Professor Slughorn want?\" Hermione asked.\n\"To know what really happened at the Ministry.\" said Harry.\n\"Him and everyone else here,\" sniffed Hermione. \"People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren't they, Ron?\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. \"All wanting to know if you really are 'the Chosen One' \u2014\"\n\"There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,\" interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. \"I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. 'Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust.'\" \n\u201cThat's nor saying much, seeing as you're already dead,\" Ron observed.\n\u201cOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\n\"The very best of evenings to you!\" he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room. \n\u201cWhat happened to his hand?\" gasped Hermione.\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore's right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys.

What is he, when you come down to it?

What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded.\n\"Do you mean \u2014\u201c\nMalfoy shrugged.\n\"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't?It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\"\n\"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?\" asked\nZabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?\"\n\"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly.\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.\n\"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on.\"\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\n\"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something.\"\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\"\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.\n\"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . .\"\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers.\n\"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here . . .\"\n-=-Him\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.\n\"That's from my father. Now, let's see. . . .\"\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him.\n\"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter ... or not.\"\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.\n\nChapter 8:  Victorious Snape\n\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the _ Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. \nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in... and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \"Accio W", "PPL": 6.679127216339111, "PPL/lower": 0.9713084541238506, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019702440166192068, "Min-5%": 34.49426602382286, "Min-10%": 29.397936549841187, "Min-20%": 23.506845040542864, "Min-30%": 19.253563829664298, "Min-40%": 15.89857056758806, "Min-50%": 13.240223997149648, "Min-60%": 11.128314026731525}, {"text": "deten-tion again, leave it!\"\n\"Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,\" said Snape, smirking a little, \"and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.\"\n  \nRon was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry. \n  \n\"Snape's right, though, isn't he?\" said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. \"I dunno whether it's worth me taking the test. I just can't get the hang of Apparition.\" \n  \n\"You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,\" said Harry reasonably. \"It'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you're still not \u2014 you know \u2014 as good as you'd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer \u2014 Myrtle, this is the boys' bathroom!\" \n  \nThe ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. \"Oh,\" she said glumly. \"It's you two.\" \n  \n\"Who were you expecting?\" said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.\n  \n\"Nobody,\" said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. \"He said he'd come back and see me, but then you said you'd pop in and visit me too\" \u2014 she gave Harry a reproachful look \u2014 \"and I haven't seen you for months and months. I've learned not to ex-pect too much from boys.\" \n  \n\"I thought you lived in that girls' bathroom?\" said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now. \n  \n\"I do,\" she said, with a sulky little shrug, \"but that doesn't mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?\" \n  \n\"Vividly,\" said Harry.\n  \n\"But I thought he liked me,\" she said plaintively. \"Maybe if you two left, he'd come back again. We had lots in common. I'm sure he felt it.\"\n  \nAnd she looked hopefully toward the door. \"When you say you had lots in common,\" said Ron, sounding rather amused now, \"d'you mean he lives in an S-bend too?\" \n  \n\"No,\" said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. \"I mean he's sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!\" \n  \n\"There's been a boy in here crying?\" said Harry curiously. \"A young boy?\"\n  \n\"Never you mind!\" said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. \"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, and I'll take his secret to the \u2014\" \n  \n\"\u2014 not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\" Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. \"You're right,\" he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, \"I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-cide about taking the test.\"\n  \nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement. \n  \n\"You'd do better,\" said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, \"to go straight to Slughorn's of-fice and try and get that memory from him.\" \n  \n\"I've been trying!\" said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. \n  \n\"He doesn't want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's not going to let it happen!\u201d \n  \n\"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?\"\n  \nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was do-ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement. \n  \nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-rauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\" and scanned it carefully. \n  \nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-hind her before bending very low and whispering, \"Hello\u2026you're very pretty, aren't you?\" \n  \nGoyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.\n  \nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\n  \n\"OUCH!\"\n  \nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.\n  \n\"Harry?\"\n  \nHe spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor. \n  \n\"What\u2019", "PPL": 7.2065887451171875, "PPL/lower": 1.0374353847194064, "PPL/zlib": 0.002093113199278881, "Min-5%": 36.2512633005778, "Min-10%": 30.890358812668744, "Min-20%": 24.61298658795345, "Min-30%": 20.312538507318653, "Min-40%": 16.956639764944324, "Min-50%": 14.231903506280856, "Min-60%": 11.999939313625571}, {"text": "ach when Mrs Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, 'I've ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work wonders.'\n    Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.\n    'How am I getting there?' he asked Mrs Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.\n    'Arthur's taking you to work with him,' said Mrs Weasley gently.\n    Mr Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.\n    'You can wait in my office until it's time for the hearing,' he said.\n    Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs Weasley had answered it.\n    'Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I - '\n    ' - think he's quite right,' said Sirius through clenched teeth.\n    Mrs Weasley pursed her lips.\n    'When did Dumbledore tell you that?' Harry said, staring at Sirius.\n    'He came last night, when you were in bed,' said Mr Weasley\n    Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse.\n- CHAPTER SEVEN -\nThe Ministry of Magic\nHarry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.\n    Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying net to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen.\n    He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered.\n    'Breakfast,' she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.\n    'M - m - morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. 'Sleep all right?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'I've b - b - been up all night,' she said, with another shuddering yawn. 'Come and sit down . . .'\n    She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it ir the process.\n    'What do you want, Harry?' Mrs Weasley called. 'Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?'\n    'Just - just toast, thanks,' said Harry.\n    Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, 'What were you saying about Scrimgeour?'\n    'Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions . . .'\n    Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn't.\n    '. . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t - t - too tired,' Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.\n    'Ill cover for you,' said Mr Weasley. 'I'm OK, I've got a report to finish anyway\n    Mr Weasley was not wearing wizards' robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.\n    'How are you feeling?'\n    Harry shrugged.\n    'It'll all be over soon,' Mr Weasley said bracingly. 'In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.'\n    Harry said nothing.\n    The hearings on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the one who'll be questioning you.'\n    'Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,' said Tonks earnestly. 'She's fair, she'll hear you out.'\n    Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.\n    'Don't lose your temper,' said Sirius abruptly. 'Be polite and stick to the facts.'\n    Harry nodded again.\n    The law's on your side,' said Lupin quietly. 'Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.'\n    Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.\n    'Doesn't it ever lie flat?' she said desperately.\n    Harry shook his head.\n    Mr Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. I think we'll go now,' he said. 'We're a bit early, but I think you 11 be better off at the Ministry than hanging around here.'\n    'OK,' said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet.\n    'You'll be all right, Harry,' said Tonks, palling him on the arm.\n    'Good luck,' said Lupin. 'I'm sure it will be fine.'\n    'And if it's not,' said Sirius grimly, 'I'll see to Amelia Bones for you . . .'\n    Harry smiled weakly. Mrs Weasley hugged him.\n    'We've all got our fingers crossed,' she said.\n    'Right,' said Harry. 'Well . . . see you later then.'\n    He followed Mr Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, grey dawn.\n    'You don't normally walk to work, do you?' Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square.\n    'No, I usually Apparate,' said Mr Weasley, 'but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for . . .'\n    Mr Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were al most deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of early-morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.\n    'Simply fabulous,' he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. 'Wonderfully ingenious.'\n    They're out of order,' said Harry, pointing at the sign.\n    'Yes, but even so . . .' said Mr Weasley, beaming at them fondly.\n    They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding", "PPL": 0.4983324706554413, "PPL/lower": 0.3994522518614216, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001505536165122179, "Min-5%": 9.124003377615237, "Min-10%": 4.958247728280577, "Min-20%": 2.4919535286137084, "Min-30%": 1.6609205387463317, "Min-40%": 1.2469319035381665, "Min-50%": 0.9971210150133656, "Min-60%": 0.8306813488770342}, {"text": "back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out. After he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.\n    In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry's fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.\n    'Hi, Harry,' he panted. 'Hi, Ginny . . . everywhere's full . . . I can't find a seat . . . '\n    'What are you talking about?' said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here - '\n    Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.\n    'Don't be silly,' said Ginny, laughing, 'she's all right.'\n    She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside. Harry and Neville followed.\n    'Hi, Luna.' said Ginny, 'is it OK if we take these seats?'\n    The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave oil an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded.\n    Thanks,' said Ginny, smiling at her.\n    Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig's cage in the luggage rack and sat down. Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn't.\n    'Had a good summer, Luna?' Ginny asked.\n    'Yes,' said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. 'Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You're Harry Potter,' she added.\n    'I know I am,' said Harry.\n    Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes on him instead.\n    'And I don't know who you are.'\n    'I'm nobody,' said Neville hurriedly.\n    'No you're not,' said Ginny sharply. 'Neville Longbottom - Luna Lovegood. Luna's in my year, but in Ravenclaw.'\n    'Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,' said Luna in a singsong voice.\n    She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.\n    The train rattled onwards, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds.\n    'Guess what I got for my birthday?' said Neville.\n    'Another Remembrall?' said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville's grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.\n    'No,' said Neville. 'I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago . . . no, look at this . . .'\n    He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines.\n    'Mimbulus mimbletonia,' he said proudly.\n    Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.\n    'It's really, really rare,' said Neville, beaming. 'I don't know if there's one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can't wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I'm going to see if I can breed from it.'\n    Harry knew that Neville's favourite subject was Herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.\n    'Does it - er - do anything?' he asked.\n    'Loads of stuff!' said Neville proudly. 'It's got an amazing defensive mechanism. Here, hold Trevor for me . . .'\n    He dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood's popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine again, to watch what Neville was\n    doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimblctonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.\n    Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant; thick, stinking, dark green jets of it. They hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood's magazine; Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor's escape, received a faceful. It smelled like rancid manure.\n    Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes.\n    'S - sorry,' he gasped. 'I haven't tried that before . . . didn't realise it would be quite so . . . don't worry, though, Stinksap's not poisonous,' he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor.\n    At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.\n    'Oh . . . hello, Harry,' said a nervous voice. 'Urn . . . bad time?'\n    Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.\n    'Oh . . . hi,' said Harry blankly.\n    'Um . . .' said Cho. 'Well . . . just thought I'd say hello . . . bye then.'\n    Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.\n    'Never mind,' said Ginny bracingly. 'Look, we can easily get rid of all this.' She pulled out her wand. 'Scourgify!'\n    The Stinksap vanished.\n    'Sorry.' said Neville again, in a small voice.\n    Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.\n    'I'm starving,' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the frog's head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning.\n    'Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,' said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat.

All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\" said Ron tentatively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he's getting stronger.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape hadn't held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might've got there in time. 'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter?' Why couldn't he have just got out of the way?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he didn't want you to get there!\" said Ron quickly. \"Maybe - hang on - how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest? D'you reckon he could've beaten you and Dumbledore there?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't put it past him,\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"We need to see Professor Moody,\" said Hermione. \"We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\" said Ron, \"because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" said Hermione suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn't like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?\"\n\u3000\u3000The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing here?\" Ron and Fred said at the same time.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sending a letter,\" said Harry and George in unison.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, at this time?\" said Hermione and Fred.\n\u3000\u3000Fred grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine - we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, don't let us hold you up,\" Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't move. \"Who're you blackmailing?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000The grin vanished from Fred's face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be stupid, I was only joking,\" he said easily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't sound like that,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \"I've told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can't see why you would, but -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my business if you're blackmailing someone,\" said Ron. \"George's right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Told you, I was joking,\" said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \"You're starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you'll be made a prefect.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I won't!\" said Ron hotly.\n\u3000\u3000George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.\"\n\u3000\u3000He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think they know something about all this, do you?\" Hermione whispered. \"About Crouch and everything?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. They'd tell Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" Hermione asked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well. . .\" said Ron slowly, \"I dunno if they would. They're . . . they're obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them", "PPL": 0.6495304107666016, "PPL/lower": 0.40283806949938833, "PPL/zlib": 0.00021373162578696992, "Min-5%": 10.667732075148939, "Min-10%": 6.396888351031378, "Min-20%": 3.248862386451155, "Min-30%": 2.165159741873892, "Min-40%": 1.6253486566322335, "Min-50%": 1.299679362987029, "Min-60%": 1.0827227725958615}, {"text": "so we'll see you quite soon,\" said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. \"You make sure you look after yourself and ?quot;\nThe train was gathering speed.\n\"?be good and ?quot; , She was jogging to keep up now.\n\"?stay safe!\"\nHarry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n\"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\"\n\"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n\"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him.\n\"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.\n\"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n\"Luna, hi, how are you?\"\n\"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n\"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\n\"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily.\n\"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n\"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\"\n\"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \"Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've\nseen it.\"\n\"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\" said Neville, \"but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\"\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n\"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day ?oi, come back here, Trevor!\"\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n\"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna,\nwho was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n\"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n\"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\"\n\"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\"\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.\n\"You ask him!\"\nNo, you!\n\"I'll do it!\"\nAnd one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.\n\"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,\" she said loudly and confidently. \"Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them,\" she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\n\"They're friends of mine,\" said Harry coldly.\n\"Oh,\" said the girl, looking very surprised. \"Oh. Okay.\"\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\n\"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,\" said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.\n\"You are cool,\" said Harry shortly. \"None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.\"\n\"That's a very nice thing to say,\" beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The\nQuibbler.\n\"We didn't face him, though,\" said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \"You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Harry Potter's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son. . . .\nHarry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an \"Acceptable,\" Harry watched him without really listening.\nNeville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? Would Neville\u2019s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no \"Chosen One\" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's?\n\"You all right, Harry? You look funny,\" said Neville.\nHarry started. \"Sorry ?I ?quot;\n\"Wrackspurt got you?\" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.\n\"I \u2014what?\"\n\"A Wrackspurt. . . They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\" she said. \"I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\"\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\n\"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving,\" said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. \"Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\" he added, turning to Harry. \"Malfoy s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\"\nHarry sat up straight, interested", "PPL": 7.155105113983154, "PPL/lower": 1.0127021190467738, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020321230087995325, "Min-5%": 36.94598136228674, "Min-10%": 31.714919716704127, "Min-20%": 25.07619194179992, "Min-30%": 20.583051961097343, "Min-40%": 17.093005691006013, "Min-50%": 14.212874392260554, "Min-60%": 11.921556476370132}, {"text": "on loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood. 'Gave 'em the old one-two, did you?'\n    'You can't give a Dementor the old one-two,' said Harry through clenched teeth.\n    'Why's he all right, then?' blustered Uncle Vernon. 'Why isn't e all empty, then?'\n    'Because I used the Patronus - '\n    WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.\n    'FOR GOD'S SAKE!' roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn't been driven to do in a long time. 'I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!'\n    But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl's leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything - the Dementors, Mrs Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out - that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message.\n    Arthur has just told us what's happened. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.\n    Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else.\n    And now his temper was rising again. Wasn't anybody going to say 'well done' for fighting off two Dementors single-handed? Both Mr Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he'd misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.\n    '. . . a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house. I won't have it, boy, I won't - '\n    'I can't stop the owls coming,' Harry snapped, crushing Sirius's letter in his fist.\n    'I want the truth about what happened tonight!' barked Uncle Vernon. 'If it was Demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you've been expelled? You did you-know-what, you've admitted, it!'\n    Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.\n    'I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,' he said, forcing himself to remain calm. 'It's the only thing that works against them.'\n    'But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone.\n    'Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily. 'No idea.'\n    His head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.\n    'It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 'It's got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You've got to be the only - the only - ' Evidently, he couldn't bring himself to say the word 'wizard'. The only you-know-what for miles.'\n    'I don't know why they were here.'\n    But at Uncle Vernon's words, Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why had the Dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the Dementors? Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?\n    'These Demembers guard some weirdo prison?' asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in the wake of Harry's train of thought.\n    'Yes,' said Harry.\n    If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think . . .\n    'Oho! They were coming to arrest you!' said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. That's it, isn't it, boy? You're on the run from the law!'\n    'Of course I'm not,' said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now.\n    Then why - ?'\n    'He must have sent them,' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.\n    'What's that? Who must have sent them?'\n    'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry.\n    He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if they heard words like 'wizard', 'magic' or 'wand', could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.\n    'Lord - hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes. 'I've heard that name . . . that was the one who - '\n    'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully.\n    'But he's gone,' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic. That giant bloke said so. He's gone.'\n    'He's back,' said Harry heavily.\n    It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside the top'-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world, and Mrs Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; Dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts. Harry's head throbbed more painfully.\n    'Back?' whispered Aunt Petunia.\n    She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sisters) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life - that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon - seemed to have fallen away.\n    'Yes,' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. ;He came back a month ago. I saw him.'\n    Her hands found Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.\n    'Hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. 'Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.'\n    'Yes.'\n    The one who murdered your parents.'\n    'Yes.'\n    'And now he's sending Dismembers after you?'\n    'Looks like it,' said Harry.\n    T see,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his\n    great purple face stretching before Harry's eyes. 'Well, that settles it,' he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, 'you can get out of this house, boy!'\n    'What?' said Harry.\n    '", "PPL": 0.832705020904541, "PPL/lower": 0.5550673352995641, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002566117167656521, "Min-5%": 13.929721093645282, "Min-10%": 8.22870662194841, "Min-20%": 4.164235505257212, "Min-30%": 2.775585322890731, "Min-40%": 2.0836689079646873, "Min-50%": 1.66619000271836, "Min-60%": 1.3880595926647807}, {"text": "\n\u3000\u3000\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed.

With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . . think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up, Harry?\" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something I haven't told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him.. . him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill...someone.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn't bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but was it, though?\" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It's weird, isn't it?. . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't - say - his - name!\" Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?\" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione's terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You weren't there,\" said Harry. \"You didn't hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance - a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would rise again. .\n\u3000\u3000. greater and more terrible than ever before. . . and he'd manage it because his servant was going to go back to him. . . and that night Wormtail escaped.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?\" Hermione asked. \"Are you expecting a letter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told Sirius about my scar,\" said Harry, shrugging. \"I'm waiting for his answer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking!\" said Ron, his expression clearing. \"I bet Sirius'll know what to do!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I hoped he'd get back to me quickly,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"But we don't know where Sirius is. . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000said Hermione reasonably. \"Hedwig's not going to manage that journey in a few days.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry\" said Ron. \"Come on - three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. .. . You can try out the Wronski Feint... .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" said Hermione, in an I-don't-think-you're-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, \"Harry doesn't want to play Quidditch right now... . He's worried, and he's tired. . . .\n\u3000\u3000We all need to go to bed...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,\" said Harry suddenly. \"Hang on, I'll get my Firebolt.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like \"Boys.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been an absolute uproar,\" Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. \"I've been putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don't open a Howler straight away, it explodes.\n\u3000\u3000Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are they all sending Howlers?\" asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Complaining about security at the World Cup,\" said Percy. \"They want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher's put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I've got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative.\n\u3000\u3000It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family's names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. \"Home,\" \"school,\" and \"work\" were there, but there was also \"traveling,\"\n\u3000\u3000\"lost,\" \"hospital,\" \"prison,\" and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \"mortal peril.\"\n\u3000\u3000Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the \"home\" position, but Mr. Weasley's, which was the longest, was still pointing to \"work.\" Mrs. We", "PPL": 0.609074592590332, "PPL/lower": 0.4793363634239968, "PPL/zlib": 0.00018723473488789795, "Min-5%": 11.173751372917026, "Min-10%": 6.087365410418487, "Min-20%": 3.048955507700566, "Min-30%": 2.0314057409807513, "Min-40%": 1.5230218607311554, "Min-50%": 1.2181405566813268, "Min-60%": 1.015783678709395}, {"text": "crowd, Harry followed Mr Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises.\n    'All right, Arthur?' said the wizard, nodding at Mr Weasley.\n    What've you got there, Bob?' asked Mr Weasley, looking at the box.\n    'We're not sure,' said the wizard seriously. 'We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.'\n    With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.\n    'Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office.'\n    The lift doors opened. Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls. One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman's voice announced:\n    'Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office and Apparation Test Centre.'\n    Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see Ministry of Magic stamped along the edge of their wings.\n    'Just inter-departmental memos,' Mr Weasley muttered to him. 'We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings a I over the desks\n    As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lift's ceiling.\n    'Level Five, Department of International Magical Co-operation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.'\n    When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it.\n    'Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau.\n    ' 'S'cuse,' said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again.\n    'Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.'\n    Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr Weasley, Harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement.\n    'Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services.'\n    'This is us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. 'My office is on the other side of the floor.'\n    'Mr Weasley,' said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, 'aren't we still underground?'\n    'Yes, we are,' said Mr Weasley. Those are enchanted windows. Magical Maintenance decide what weather we'll get every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise . . . Just round here, Harry.'\n    They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read: Auror Headquarters.\n    Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything From pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favourite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n    'Morning, Weasley,' said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?'\n    'Yes, if it really is a second,' said Mr Weasley, 'I'm in rather a hurry.'\n    They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr We ashy stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle.\n    Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction was Sirius's face. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding - 'papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.\n    'Here,' said Kingsley brusquely to Mr Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand. 'I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.'\n    Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, 'Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.' Then he said in normal tones, 'And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.'\n    'If you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms,' said Mr Weasley coolly. 'And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we're extremely busy at the moment.' He dropped his voice and said, 'If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.'\n    He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading: Misuse of Muggle Artefacts.\n    Mr Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr Weasley's obsessions: several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine; two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books; and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.\n    Sitting on top of Mr Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a dis", "PPL": 0.6168636679649353, "PPL/lower": 0.6893890327828416, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001779243345730993, "Min-5%": 11.481570547702265, "Min-10%": 6.169082677284, "Min-20%": 3.085619053156696, "Min-30%": 2.0561407405163727, "Min-40%": 1.5435426534175012, "Min-50%": 1.234291833531825, "Min-60%": 1.0282628293620593}, {"text": "about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry \"Finished,\" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't use you,\" Harry told her, looking around for the school owls.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to use one of these.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"First Ron, then you,\" Harry said angrily. \"This isn't my fault.\"\n\u3000\u3000If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the\n\u3000\u3000tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\n\u3000\u3000The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him -but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.\n\u3000\u3000He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.\n\u3000\u3000Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have died..\n\u3000\u3000. how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task's my bet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes.\n\u3000\u3000\"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Roun' the middle,\" said Hagrid, demonstrating. \"Er - yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like. Harry - you come here an' help me with this big one....\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's real intention, however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \"So - yer competin', Harry. In the tournament. School champion.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"One of the champions,\" Harry corrected him.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You believe I didn't do it, then?\" said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid's words.\n\u3000\u3000\"Course I do,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Yeh say it wasn' you, an' I believe yeh - an' Dumbledore believes yer, an' all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wish I knew who did do it,\" said Harry bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs - but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?\" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, I don' know, Harry,\" Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face. \"School champion. . . everythin' seems ter happen ter you, doesn' it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him. . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.\n\u3000\u3000The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.\n\u3000\u3000He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship.\n\u3000\u3000But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.\n\u3000\u3000Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum's autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing", "PPL": 1.0382332801818848, "PPL/lower": 0.7072243432459524, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002930379001360104, "Min-5%": 18.31762310102874, "Min-10%": 10.395045634432167, "Min-20%": 5.195314383652849, "Min-30%": 3.461164704765438, "Min-40%": 2.598080711676797, "Min-50%": 2.07747072640954, "Min-60%": 1.7306680967382746}, {"text": "ter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now.'\n    Harry smiled.\n    'You can't help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.'\n    He bent and picked up his Potions book. He'd have to try to finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand - the result of his detentions with Umbridge . . .\n    Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me, Dobby,' said Harry slowly.\n    The elf looked round, beaming.\n    'Name it, Harry Potter, sir!'\n    'I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,' Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, 'Professor Umbridge.'\n    He expected the elf's smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find somewhere, but his hopes were not high. What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his hands together.\n    'Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!' he said happily. 'Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!'\n    'Why?' said Harry curiously.\n    'Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, 'when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs. Dobby has used it, sir,' said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, 'when Winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir . . . and Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and - '\n    'And if you really needed a bathroom,' said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, 'would it fill itself with chamber pots?'\n    'Dobby expects so, sir,' said Dobby, nodding earnestly. 'It is a most amazing room, sir.'\n    'How many people know about it?' said Harry, sitting up straight er in his chair.\n    'Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.'\n    'It sounds brilliant,' said Harry, his heart racing. 'It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?'\n    'Any time, Harry Potter, sir,' said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry's enthusiasm. 'We could go now, if you like!'\n    For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby. He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had Snape's essay to finish.\n    'Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. This is really important . . . I don't want to blow it, it'll need proper planning. Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there?'\n*\nTheir robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon's Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled.\n    'Good,' said Harry quietly, when she. told him, 'because we've found somewhere to have our first Defence meeting. Tonight, eight o'clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?'\n    She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him.\n    'What?' he said thickly.\n    Well . . . it's just that Dobby's plans aren't always that safe. Don't you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?'\n    This room isn't just some mad idea of Dobby's; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.'\n    Hermione's expression cleared.\n    'Dumbledore told you about it?'\n    'Just in passing,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'Oh, well, that's all right then,' said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections.\n    Together - 'with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog's Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry's disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog's Head.\n    At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor.\n    'Hold it,' Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and muttering, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\"\n    A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots, labelled with names, showed where various people were.\n    'Filch is on the second floor,' said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, 'and Mrs Norris is on the fourth.'\n    'And Umbridge?' said Hermione anxiously.\n    'In her office,' said Harry, pointing. 'OK, let's go.'\n    They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.\n    'OK,' said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them. 'Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.'\n    They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; Hermione was whispering something under her breath; Harry's fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him.\n    We need somewhere to learn to fight . . . he thought. Just give us a place to practise . . . somewhere they can't find us . . .\n    'Harry!' said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.\n    A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.\n    The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor.

Her expression did nor soften.\n\"You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?\"\n\"Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?\" asked Snape.\n\"He . . . lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!\"\n\"If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible \u2014\"\n\"You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!\" she jeered.\n\"I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago. . . .\"\n\"But why did you keep him alive?\"\n\"Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.\n\"Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.\"\n\"And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?\" asked Bellatrix. \"He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?\"\n\"I have played my part well,\" said Snape. \"And you overlook Dumbledore's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms \u2014 though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard \u2014 oh yes, he has,\" (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), \"the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.\"\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\n\"Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?\"\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\n\"Yes, Severus. I \u2014 I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .\"\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\n\"The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,\" Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. \"He wishes none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But \u2014\"\n\"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,\" said Snape at once. \"The Dark Lord's word is law.\"\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.\n\"There!\" she said triumphantly to her sister. \"Even Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!\"\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n\"It so happens that I know of the plan,\" he said in a low voice. \"I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.\"\n\"I thought you must know about it!\" said Narcissa, breathing more freely. \"He trusts you so, Severus. ...\"\n\"You know about the plan?\" said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. \"You know?\"\n\"Certainly,\" said Snape. \"But what help do you require, Nar-cissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.\"\n\"Severus,\" she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. \"My son . . . my only son . . .\"\n\"Draco should be proud,\" said Bellatrix indifferently. \"The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: he isn't shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect \u2014\"\nNarcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.\n\"That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Lucius's mistake, I know it!\"\nSnape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.\n\"That's why he's chosen Draco, isn't it?\" she persisted. \"To punish Lucius?\"\n\"If Draco succeeds,\" said Snape, still looking away from her, \"he will be honored above all others.\"\n\"But he won't succeed!\" sobbed Narcissa. \"How can he, when the Dark Lord himself\u2014 ?\"\nBellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.\n\"I only meant. . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius's old friend. ... I beg you. .. . You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him \u2014 ?\"\n\"The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,\" said Snape flatly. \"I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.\"\n\"Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!\" choked Narcissa. \"He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!\"\nWhen Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, \"You could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us \u2014\"\nSnape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, \"He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.\"\n\"In other words, it doesn't matter to", "PPL": 7.422148704528809, "PPL/lower": 0.9724512705225083, "PPL/zlib": 0.002195901983588405, "Min-5%": 39.30885752509622, "Min-10%": 33.260354182299444, "Min-20%": 26.519186791697457, "Min-30%": 21.603910907471995, "Min-40%": 17.772222935716215, "Min-50%": 14.747371396011621, "Min-60%": 12.366469557242352}, {"text": "ble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.

They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\n115\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!\"'\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\nHarry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three\n-- two --\"\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it's all right,\n116\nup you get.\".\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\"\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\n\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,\nParvati.\"\n\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\"\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"\n\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n117\n\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble.\"\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\nheld the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\"HARRY POTTER!\"\nHis heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"\n118\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\"\n\"It wasn't his fault, Professor --\"\n\"Be quiet, Miss Patil\n\"But Malfoy --\"\n\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley.

Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze. Harry,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can leave that till morning, can't we, Dumbledore?\" said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. \"Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I thought I could help you,\" Dumbledore said gently, \"by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\n\u3000\u3000He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup.\n\u3000\u3000Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.\n\u3000\u3000When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.\n\u3000\u3000\"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,\" Harry told Dumbledore. \"He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.\"\n\u3000\u3000For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" he said, sitting down again. \"Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort's speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.\n\u3000\u3000But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his father . . . his mother . .\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"The wands connected?\" he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. \"Why?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Priori Incantatem,\" he muttered.\n\u3000\u3000His eyes gazed into Harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Reverse Spell effect?\" said Sirius sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Harry's wand and Voldemorts wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,\" he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"My wand's feather came from Fawkes?\" Harry said, amazed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So what happens when a wand meets its brother?\" said Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000\"They will not work properly against each other,\" said Dumbledore. \"If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place.\n\u3000\u3000One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed - in reverse. The most recent first. . . and then those which preceded it. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which means,\" said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, \"that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nodded again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Diggory came back to life?\" said Sirius sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"No spell can reawaken the dead,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He spoke to me,\" Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. \"The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An echo,\" said Dumbledore, \"which retained Cedric's appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort's wand....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An old man,\" Harry said, his throat still constricted. \"Bertha Jorkins.

'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\n    'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\n    'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\n    He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\n    'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\n    'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\n    'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\n    He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\n    'Are - you - insane?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily.\n    'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'And how are you going to get in there in the first place?'\n    Harry was ready for this question.\n    'Sirius's knife,' he said.\n    'Excuse me?'\n    'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry. 'So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has - '\n    'What do you think about this?' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\n    'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. 'If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it?'\n    'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. 'Right, then. We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact ii everybody's in the corridors - Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office - I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?' he said, looking at George.\n    'Easy,' said George.\n    'What sort of diversion is it?' asked Ron.\n    'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again. 'At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow.'\n*\nHarry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.\n    After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his fathers behaviour . . .\n    Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal tc stoking the fire.\n    Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.\n    With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in\n    History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\n    '. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .'\n    'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop", "PPL": 0.5226581692695618, "PPL/lower": 0.4838954071719226, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014697923770235144, "Min-5%": 9.345566312472025, "Min-10%": 5.209271842869473, "Min-20%": 2.6137671876291138, "Min-30%": 1.7420349512709963, "Min-40%": 1.3078010517560614, "Min-50%": 1.045792790213792, "Min-60%": 0.871229319468094}, {"text": "toward the plinth where the cup stood.

His feet had left the ground.\n\u3000\u3000He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO - FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where are we?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around.\n\u3000\u3000They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles -perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone.\n\u3000\u3000They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \"Is this supposed to be part of the task?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \"Wands out, d'you reckon?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.\n\u3000\u3000They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the\n\u3000\u3000strange feeling that they were being watched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone's coming,\" he said suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.\n\u3000\u3000Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And - several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\n\u3000\u3000It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.\n\u3000\u3000And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\n\u3000\u3000From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \"Kill the spare.\"\n\u3000\u3000A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \"Avada Kedavra!\"\n\u3000\u3000A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\n\u3000\u3000For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\n\u3000\u3000The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.\n\u3000\u3000TOM RIDDLE The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him - hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.\n\u3000\u3000\"You!\" he gasped.\n\u3000\u3000But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.\n\u3000\u3000It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes ...\n\u3000\u3000he didn't want that bundle opened....\n\u3000\u3000He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail's fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry's range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water - Harry could hear it slopping around - and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.\n\u3000\u3000The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling names beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry!\"\n\u3000\u3000The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is ready. Master.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now ...\" said the cold voice.\n\u3000\u3000Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind - but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face - no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.\n\u3000\u3000The thing seemed", "PPL": 0.48830145597457886, "PPL/lower": 0.4671933970603163, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014792531232189605, "Min-5%": 8.664414134680056, "Min-10%": 4.855686844856131, "Min-20%": 2.44196848780905, "Min-30%": 1.6275609528303832, "Min-40%": 1.2218541531134548, "Min-50%": 0.9770584111097089, "Min-60%": 0.8139632000613927}, {"text": "as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.\n\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!

He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\n\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n99\n\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle.

Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"\nThe others laughed.\n\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\n\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\nnot be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\nOn Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harry's forehead.\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy.\n100\n\"N-nothing.\"\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\n\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"\nDumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor\non the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.\n101\n\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\n\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed:\n\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please,\nWhether we be old and bald\nOr young with scabby knees,\nOur heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff,\nFor now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff,\nSo teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot,\njust do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they\n102\nhad finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were\nlike lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their\nfeet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes", "PPL": 0.6402807235717773, "PPL/lower": 0.5412026001195247, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001798541358347689, "Min-5%": 12.582591097728878, "Min-10%": 6.417880706918225, "Min-20%": 3.2039049202974765, "Min-30%": 2.134479337130144, "Min-40%": 1.602231478446266, "Min-50%": 1.2811784726120277, "Min-60%": 1.0673060580800278}, {"text": "NOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE - '\n    The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head.

And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry - and there goes Sirius's mum again.'\n    Mrs Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.\n    George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.\n    Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.\n    The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's.\n    '. . . smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do . . .'\n    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.\n    The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.\n    'Kreacher did not see young master,' he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, 'Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.'\n    'Sorry?' said George. 'Didn't catch that last bit.'\n    'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second box to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there its twin, unnataral little beasts they are.'\n    Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.\n    '. . . and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name.

'Harry Potter.'\n    Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.\n    The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say - '\n    'Don't call her a Mudblood!' said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.\n    'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '\n    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.\n    Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.\n    'Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '\n    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred.\n    'What do you want, anyway?' George asked.\n    Kreacher's huge eyes darted towards George.\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' he said evasively.\n    'A likely story,' said a voice behind Harry.\n    Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen.\n    At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.\n    'Stand up straight,' said Sirius impatiently. 'Now, what are you up to?'\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' the elf repeated. 'Kreacher lives to serve lie Noble House of Black - '\n    'And it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,' said Sirius.\n    'Master always liked his little joke,' said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 'Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart - '\n    'My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,' snapped Sirius. 'She kept herself alive out of pure spite.'\n    Kreacher bowed again as he spoke.\n    'Whatever Master says,' he muttered furiously. 'Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was - '\n    'I asked you what you were up to,' said Sirius coldly.

'She'll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don't doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.'\n    It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.\n    ' - comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he's back, they say he's a murderer too - '\n    'Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!' said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf.\n    'Sirius, he's not right in the head,' Hermione pleaded, 'I don't think he realises we can hear him.'\n    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '\n    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '\n    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly. 'And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.'\n    Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.\n    The tapestry looked immensely old; it was laded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black\nToujours pur'\n'You're", "PPL": 1.1351934671401978, "PPL/lower": 1.0792290499792205, "PPL/zlib": 0.00035720373415361795, "Min-5%": 19.770589206732957, "Min-10%": 11.262980899974412, "Min-20%": 5.678282199812311, "Min-30%": 3.784004698715291, "Min-40%": 2.8405966100320397, "Min-50%": 2.271450651486472, "Min-60%": 1.8922845965895154}, {"text": "made to leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practise; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions.\n    He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe. He stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something . . . then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights n the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.\n    He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape's thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's defences accidentally . . .\n    Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him . . . what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?\n    The silvery lights shivered on the wall . . . Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?\n    Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right.\n    Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.\n    The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling . . . in fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down into the Great Hall.\n    His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts . . . his brain seemed to be in limbo . . . it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do . . . he was trembling . . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of Malfoy's jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.\n    He took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve . . .\n    He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then - '\n    He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone. Instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.\n    Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere . . . this was his memory . . .\n    And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.\n    So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age. His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.\n    'Five more minutes!'\n    The voice made Harry jump. Turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very untidy black hair . . .\n    Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy's head drew nearer and . . . he was straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written . . .\n    Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father.\n    Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.\n    James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been. Then, with a glance towards Professor Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him.\n    With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this girl - Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm - was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.\n    So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too . . . and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbour's paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters 'L.E.'. What did they stand for?\n    'Quills down, please!' squeaked Professor Flitwick. That means you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Accio!'\n    Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms, knocking him backwards off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet.\n    'Thank you . . . thank you,' panted Professor Flitwick. 'Very well, everybody, you're free to go!'\n    Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the 'L.E.' he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.\n    Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face.\n    A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and L", "PPL": 0.8762969970703125, "PPL/lower": 0.8465866635955315, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002531918512193911, "Min-5%": 15.31664909101, "Min-10%": 8.725930110350543, "Min-20%": 4.3834059680265565, "Min-30%": 2.920953742443646, "Min-40%": 2.1927546144657812, "Min-50%": 1.7534176107614345, "Min-60%": 1.4607258906400975}, {"text": "-\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"By all accounts, he is no loss!\" blustered Fudge. \"It seems he has been responsible for several deaths'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \"He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?\" blustered Fudge. \"He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who's instructions!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,\" Dumbledore said. \"Those peoples deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\" said Dumbledore, \"we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins -went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Dumbledore,\" said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, \"you - you can't seriously believe that You-Know-Who - back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore steadily. \"He witnessed Lord Voldemort's rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, \"I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge's curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \"You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, I believe Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \"I heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized that Harry was awake.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"And if I have?\" he said, looking at Dumbledore. \"If I have discovered that you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore coolly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?\" said Fudge quickly. \"Headaches?\n\u3000\u3000Nightmares? Possibly - hallucinations?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen to me, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. \"Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I've never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, I saw Voldemort come back!\" Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. \"I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names!\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy -\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape's eyes flew back to Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy was cleared!\" said Fudge, visibly affronted. \"A very old family - donations to excellent causes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair!\" Harry continued.\n\u3000\u3000\"Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Avery - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!\" said Fudge angrily. \"You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heavens sake, Dumbledore - the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are getting taller, and you're still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes. Dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You fool!\" Professor McGonagall cried. \"Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I see no evidence to the contrary!\" shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. \"It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that Voldemort could have risen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort has returned,\" Dumbledore repeated. \"If you accept that fact straightaway.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Preposterous!\" shouted Fudge again. \"Remove the dementors? I'd be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!\" said Dumbledore. \"They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge!\n\u3000\u3000Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can!

Hermione set off imme-diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape's dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet. \n  \nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. \n  \nHe closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement's door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, \u201cI need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here...\u201d \n  \nThree times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it \u2014 but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding. \n  \n\"Okay,\" said Harry aloud. \"Okay... I thought the wrong thing...\" He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-centrating as hard as he could. \u201cI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly...\u201d After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly. \n  \nThere was no door.\n  \n\"Oh, come off it,\" he told the wall irritably. \"That was a clear instruction. Fine.\" He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. \u201cI need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy...\u201d \n  \nHe did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes. \n  \nThere was still no door.\n  \nHarry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\nHarry tried every variation of \"I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\" that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went. \n  \n\"Late again, Potter,\" said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. \"Ten points from Gryfrindor.\" Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and orga-nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them. \n  \n\"Before we start, I want your dementor essays,\" said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \"And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page \u2014 what is it, Mr. Finnigan?\" \n  \n\"Sir,\" said Seamus, \"I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius \u2014\" \n  \n\"No, there wasn't,\" said Snape in a bored voice. \n  \n\"But sir, I heard people talking \u2014\" \n  \n\"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\" \n  \n\"I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,\" mut-tered Harry to Ron and Hermione. \"Shouldn't he be upset Mun-dungus has been arrest \u2014\" \n  \n\"But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,\" said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. \"Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.\" \n  \nThe whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. \"Er \u2014 well \u2014 ghosts are transparent \u2014\" he said. \n  \n\"Oh, very good,\" interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \"Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent.\"' \n  \nPansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, \"Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid \u2014\" \n  \n\"A five-year-old could have told us as much,\" sneered Snape. \"The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-ard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. \" \n  \n\"Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart!\" said Ron. \"When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if its solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'\" There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class. \n  \n\"Another ten points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape. \"I would ex-pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.\" \n  \n\"No!\" whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. \"There's no point, you'll just end up in", "PPL": 6.654261589050293, "PPL/lower": 0.9965349428904345, "PPL/zlib": 0.002017054134298361, "Min-5%": 36.469147663490446, "Min-10%": 30.98319526747161, "Min-20%": 24.256285072830313, "Min-30%": 19.62723252905308, "Min-40%": 16.08063316024603, "Min-50%": 13.245830673917414, "Min-60%": 11.088795107828775}, {"text": "is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius.

Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him.'\n    There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs; his breathing was quick and shallow.\n    'And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?' he croaked.\n    'He did not wish to tell me,' said Dumbledore. 'But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.'\n    'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 'and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him - '\n    'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore. 'I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's - '\n    'Don't you blame - don't you - talk - about Sirius like - ' Harry's breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticise Sirius. 'Kreacher's a lying - foul - he deserved - '\n    'Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,' said Dumbledore. 'Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier - '\n    'DON'T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!' Harry yelled.\n    He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered . . .\n    'What about Snape?' Harry spat. 'You're not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual - '\n    'Harry you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,' said Dumbledore steadily, 'but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest. It was he, too, who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius's whereabouts.'\n    Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him.\n    'Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - 'he made out Sirius was a coward - '\n    'Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,' said Dumbledore.\n    'Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!' Harry snarled. 'He threw me out of his office!'\n    'I am aware of it,' said Dumbledore heavily. 'I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence - '\n    'Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him - ' Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on '- how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my - '\n    'I trust Severus Snape,' said Dumbledore simply. 'But I forgot - another old man's mistake - that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father - I was wrong.'\n    'But that's OK, is it?' yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls. 'It's OK: for Snape to hate my dad, but it's not OK for Sirius to hate Kreacher?'\n    'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore. 'He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike . . . the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.'\n    'SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?' Harry yelled.\n    'I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,' Dumbledore: replied quietly. 'Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house - 'elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.'\n    'Yeah, he did hate it!' said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realising what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. 'You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that's why he wanted to get out last night - '\n    'I was trying to keep Sirius alive,' said Dumbledore quietly.\n    'People don't like being locked up!' Harry said furiously, rounding on him. 'You did it to me all last summer - '\n    Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him.\n    Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.\n    'It is time,' he said, 'for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished. I will not stop you.'\n    Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited.\n    Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, 'Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered.

But you won't tell anyone, Professor? I don't want trouble for him. ...\" \n  \nSlughorn's curiosity was evidently aroused. \"Well, I can't promise that,\" he said gruffly. \"But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. .. \n.\" \n\"Well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... It lived in the forest. ...

He's devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I'd go.\" \n  \n\"Touching, touching,\" said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid's cabin. \"But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. ...\" \n  \nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. \". . . seems an awful waste not to collect it... might get a hun-dred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .\" \n  \nAnd now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. \"Well,\" he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, \"well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know ...\" \n  \n\"Yes, of course,\" said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. \"I tell you what, Harry, I'll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We'll drink the poor beast's \u2014 well \u2014 not health \u2014 but we'll send it off in style, anyway, once it's buried. And I'll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-sion. . . .\" \n  \nHe bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid's, delighted with himself. \n  \n\"Yen came,\" croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him. \n  \n\"Yeah \u2014 Ron and Hermione couldn't, though,\" said Harry. \"They're really sorry.\" \n  \n\"Don \u2014 don matter . . . Hed've bin touched yeh're here, though, Harry. . . .\" \n  \nHagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. \n  \n\"Where are we burying him?\" he asked. \"The forest?\" \n  \n\"Blimey, no,\" said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. \"The other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog's gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didn' eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?\" \n  \nThe honest answer was \"yes\"; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the aero-mantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. \n  \n\"Never bin an area o' the forest I couldn' go before!\" said Hagrid, shaking his head. \"It wasn' easy, gettin' Aragog's body out o' there, I can tell yeh \u2014 they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give 'im a nice burial... a proper send-off. . .\" \n  \nHe broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), \"Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.\" \n  \n\"Not in trouble, are yeh?\" said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. \"Yeh shouldn\u2019 be outta the castle in the evenin', I know it, it's my fault \u2014\" \n  \n\"No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he'd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,\" said Harry. \n  \n\"He's gone to change into something more suitable, I think\u2026and he said he'd bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog's mem-ory...\u201d \n  \n\"Did he?\" said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. \"Tha's \u2014 tha's righ' nice of him, that is, an' not turnin' yeh in ei-ther. I've never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. .. . Comin' ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well. . . he\u2019d've liked that, Aragog would. . . .\" \n: \nHarry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he pro-vided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid's hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled. \n  \n\"Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?\" \n  \n\"Jus' beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,\" said Hagrid in a choked voice. \"I've already dug the \u2014 yeh know \u2014 grave. Jus' thought we'd say a few nice things over him \u2014 happy memories, yeh know \u2014\" \n  \nHis voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. \n  \n\"Hagrid,\" he said, in a deep, grave voice. \"So very sorry to hear of your loss.\" \n  \n\"Tha's very nice of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Thanks a lot. An' thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither. . . .\" \n  \n\"Wouldn't have dreamed of it,\" said Slughorn. \"Sad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?\" \n  \n\"Out here,\" said Hagrid in a shaking voice. \"Shall we \u2014 shall we do it, then?\" \n  \nThe three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid's window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot- high mound of freshly dug earth. \n  \n\"Magnificent,\" said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head. \n  \n\"", "PPL": 7.011207103729248, "PPL/lower": 0.9986058226329021, "PPL/zlib": 0.002286014706139305, "Min-5%": 36.873062526478485, "Min-10%": 30.969526786430208, "Min-20%": 24.58182869563767, "Min-30%": 20.277162688562846, "Min-40%": 16.72636987816574, "Min-50%": 13.908754668314941, "Min-60%": 11.687069696219522}, {"text": ". well . . . one of us has to go and find Umbridge and - and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office.

'I'll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it's miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way.'\n    It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.\n    'OK,' she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace. 'Now, we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin's bound to go and tip her off.\n    'Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\" said Ginny promptly, 'and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas.'

'Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we'll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius - '\n    'He's not there, Hermione!'\n    'I mean, you can - can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don't think you should be in there alone, Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it.'\n    Even through his anger and impatience, Harry recognised Hermione's offer to accompany him into Umbridge's office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.\n    'I . . . OK, thanks,' he muttered.\n    'Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, 'not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.'\n    'Five minutes'll be enough,' said Harry 'C'mon, let's go - '\n    'Now?' said Hermione, looking shocked.\n    'Of course now!' said Harry angrily. 'What did you think, we're going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!'\n    'I - oh, all right,' she said desperately. 'You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we'll meet you at the end of Umbridge's corridor, OK?'\n    Harry didn't answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius's knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them.\n    'Harry, d'you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky - '\n    But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor.\n    'Got it,' he panted. 'Ready to go, then?'\n    All right, whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them. 'So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off . . . Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor . . . Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear . . .\"\n    Ron strode away, his bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginny's equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by. Luna's blonde one.\n    'Get over here,' muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. 'Are - are you sure you're OK, Harry? You're still very pale.'\n    'I'm fine,' he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery . . .\n    'Here,' he said; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them.\n    'You can't come down here!' Ginny was calling to the crowd. 'No, sorry, you're going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase, someone's let off Garrotting Gas just along here - '\n    They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, 'I can't see no gas.'\n    That's because it's colourless,' said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, 'but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us.'\n    Slowly, the crowd thinned. The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people were not coming this way any more. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, 'I think that's as good as we're going to get, Harry - cone on, let's do it.'\n    They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, 'Good one . . . don't forget the signal.'\n    'What's the signal?' muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door.\n    'A loud chorus of \"Weasley is our King\" if they see Umbridge coming,' replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open and they entered the office.\n    The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.\n    'I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler.'\n    They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried, 'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!'\n    His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.\n    There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room.\n    'Sirius?' he shouted. 'Sirius, are you there?'\n    His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the tire.\n    'Who's there?' he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.\n    Kreacher the house-elf crept into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.\n    'It's the Potter boys head in the fire,' Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry", "PPL": 0.655189037322998, "PPL/lower": 0.5593632765735579, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001948227883803146, "Min-5%": 10.932180054047528, "Min-10%": 6.486162648773661, "Min-20%": 3.276625843073098, "Min-30%": 2.18382737640362, "Min-40%": 1.6394482183625665, "Min-50%": 1.310982925679874, "Min-60%": 1.0921510225992186}, {"text": ".\n    'Quickly, quickly!' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. 'Ah, she's left it open - '\n    Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\n    'Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last . . . they've had it coming to them for years . . .'\n    He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\n    Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\n    One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\n    It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\n    'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\n    just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\n    'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\n    Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\n    'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting . . . oh, let me do it now . . .'\n    'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\n    'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\n    He turned to his twin.\n    'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\n    'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\n    Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\n    'Definitely,' said George.\n    And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\n    'Accio brooms!'\n    Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\n    'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\n    'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\n    Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\n    'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice. 'Our new premises!'\n    'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\n    'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\n    'Give her hell from us, Peeves.'\n    And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.\n- CHAPTER THIRTY -\nGrawp\nThe story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently heard students saying things like, 'Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,' or else, 'One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.'\n    Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.\n    Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.\n    Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.\n    Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.\n    Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit", "PPL": 0.5666951537132263, "PPL/lower": 0.49826970741725113, "PPL/zlib": 0.00015789778593291345, "Min-5%": 9.653081562004838, "Min-10%": 5.585647121510085, "Min-20%": 2.8315877668299967, "Min-30%": 1.8883342917903148, "Min-40%": 1.4178531334976254, "Min-50%": 1.1338635174517624, "Min-60%": 0.9446230752960678}, {"text": "be sympathetic rather than critical.\n    'Here,' she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him, 'soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help.'\n    Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief.

'And how long do you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?'\n    Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he closed it again, defeated.\n    'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice. 'Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.'\n    'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly.\n    'No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, what can we do about that?' said Ron, yawning. \"S too late, isn't it? She's got the job, she's here to stay. Fudge'll make sure of that.'\n    'Well,' said Hermione tentatively. 'You know, I was thinking today . . .' she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, 'I was thinking that - maybe the time's come when we should just - just do it ourselves.'\n    'Do what ourselves?' said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles.\n    'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione.\n    'Come off it,' groaned Ron. 'You want us to do extra work? D'you realise Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?'\n    'But this is much more important than homework!' said Hermione.\n    Harry and Ron goggled at her.\n    'I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework!' said Ron.\n    'Don't be silly, of course there is,' said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her. 'It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting for us out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year - '\n    'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice. 'I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose - '\n    'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione. 'We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.'\n    'If you're talking about Lupin . . .' Harry began.\n    'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione. 'He's too busy with the Order and, anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.'\n    'Who, then?' said Harry, frowning at her.\n    Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.\n    'Isn't it obvious?' she said. 'I'm talking about you, Harry.'\n    There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the fire guttered.\n    'About me what?' said Harry.\n    'I'm talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts.'\n    Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.\n    He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, 'That's an idea.'\n    'What's an idea?' said Harry.\n    'You,' said Ron. Teaching us to do it.'\n    'But . . .'\n    Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.\n    'But I'm not a teacher, I can't - '\n    'Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione.\n    'Me?' said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever. 'No I'm rot, you've beaten me in every test - '\n    'Actually I haven't,' said Hermione coolly. 'You beat me in our turd year - the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Think what you've clone!'\n    'How d'you mean?'\n    'You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,' Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry.\n    'Let's think,' he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. 'Uh . . . first year - you saved the Philosopher's Stone from You-Know-Who.'\n    'But that was luck,' said Harry, 'it wasn't skill - '\n    'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'\n    'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I - '\n    Third year,' said Ron, louder still, 'you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once - '\n    'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't - '\n    'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, 'you fought off You-know-Who again - '\n    'Listen to me!' said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. 'Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck - I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help - '\n    Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry.\n    'Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?' he said heatedly. 'I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defence Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because - because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right - but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing - 'STOP LAUGHING!'\n    The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa. Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished.\n    'You don't know what it's like!

Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \n\"Ha!\" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. \n\"Oh good,\" said Hermione, delighted. \"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \n\"Are you mad?\" said Harry. \"I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out \u2014\" \nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, \"Dijjindo!\" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, \"Reparo!\" \nThere sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand. \n\"I'll give Slughorn back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons.\" \nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disap-proving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page. \n\"Anyone we know dead?\" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper. \n\"No, but there have been more dementor attacks,\" said Hermi-one. \"And an arrest.\" \n\"Excellent, who?\" said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. \"Stan Shunpike,\" said Hermione. \n\"What?\" said Harry, startled. \n\"'Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding con-veyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .'\" \n\"Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?\" said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. \"No way!\" \n\"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\" said Ron reasonably. \"You never can tell.\" \n\"It doesn't look like it,\" said Hermione, who was still reading. \"It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub.\" She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. \"If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?\" \n\"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\" said Ron. \"Isn't he the one who claimed he was going to be-come Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?\" \n\"Yeah, that's him,\" said Harry. \"I dunno what they're playing at, taking Stan seriously.\" \n\"They probably want to look as though they're doing some-thing,\" said Hermione, frowning. \"People are terrified \u2014 you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.\" \n\"What!\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \"But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We've got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Dumbledore!\" \n\"I don't think we've got him all the time,\" said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. \"Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Hagrid's this past week.\" \nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. \n\"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"I mean . . . it's all looking serious, isn't it?\" \nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since. \nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering to-gether, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, re-membering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck. \nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express. \n\"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment,\" he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry's hand. \"Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.\" \n\"You didn't try out last year, did you?\" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving. \n\"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\" said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \"Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.\" \n\"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well. . . if you wait over there ...\" He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermi-one was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and wondered whether McLaggen expected pref-erential treatment because they were both \"old Sluggy's\" favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts. \nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else. \nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. \n\"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor,\" roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, \"leave now, please! \nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. \n", "PPL": 7.271706581115723, "PPL/lower": 1.0374521977194775, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020599735357268337, "Min-5%": 37.580330287708954, "Min-10%": 32.2555362851012, "Min-20%": 25.88028867903432, "Min-30%": 21.17308221655482, "Min-40%": 17.40908706683693, "Min-50%": 14.438781241401083, "Min-60%": 12.116307745478343}, {"text": "unk under the window.

He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric, and he certainly wasn't going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right,\" said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \"Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't cheat,\" said Harry sharply. \"It was - a sort of accident that I found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody grinned. \"I wasn't accusing you, laddie. I've been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won't be. They'll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win.\n\u3000\u3000They want to beat Dumbledore. They'd like to prove he's only human.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"So. . . got any ideas how you're going to get past your dragon yet?\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I'm not going to tell you,\" said Moody gruffly. \"I don't show favoritism, me.\n\u3000\u3000I'm just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is - play to your strengths.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't got any,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Excuse me,\" growled Moody, \"you've got strengths if I say you've got them. Think now. What are you best at?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really -- \"Quidditch,\" he said dully, \"and a fat lot of help -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \"You're a damn good flier from what I've heard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but.. .\" Harry stared at him. \"I'm not allowed a broom, I've only got my wand...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My second piece of general advice,\" said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \"is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, boy. . .\" whispered Moody. \"Put them together... it's not that difficult...\"\n\u3000\u3000And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed - \"Hermione,\" Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \"Hermione - I need you to help me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I've been trying to do, Harry?\" she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\u3000\u3000And so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him.\n\u3000\u3000He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I'm trying to do?\" said Harry angrily. \"A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's good,\" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, \"just as long as it's not drawn-out. I don't want to suffer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry's eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care.\n\u3000\u3000He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid.\n\u3000\u3000He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.\n\u3000\u3000At two o'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville's toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better, Harry, that's loads better,\" Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell,\" Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, \"threaten me with a dragon.\n\u3000\u3000Right...\" He raised his wand once more. \"Accio Dictionary!\"\n\u3000\u3000The heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I really think you've got it!\" said Hermione delightedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just as long as it works tomorrow,\" Harry said. \"The Firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and I'm going to be out there on the grounds. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That doesn't matter,\" said Hermione firmly.\" Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep.. . you're going to need it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons' enclosure - though of course, they didn't yet know what they would find there.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing \"We'll have a box of tissues ready, Potter\" as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight.\n\u3000\u3000Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch.. . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000Lots of people were watching.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now... .

He says Professor Snape was involved in some -\" \"Snape killed Dumbledore,\" said Harry.\nShe stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.\n\"Snape,\" repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. \"We all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape... I can't believe it. ...\"\n\"Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,\" said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. \"We always knew that.\"\n\"But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!\" whispered Tonks. \"I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn't. ...\" .\n\"He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,\" muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. \"I mean . . . with Snapes history ... of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape's repentance was absolutely genuine-----Wouldn't hear a word against him!\"\n\"I'd love to know what Snape told him to convince him,\" said Tonks.\n\"I know,\" said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. \"Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead.\"\nThey all stared at him.\n\"And Dumbledore believed that?\" said Lupin incredulously. \"Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . .\"\n\"And he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either,\" said Harry, \"because she was Muggle-born... 'Mudblood,' he called her. ...\"\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.\n\"This is all my fault,\" said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. \"My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn't alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don't think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don't think he knew they were coming.\"\n\"It isn't your fault, Minerva,\" said Lupin firmly. \"We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way....\"\n\"So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters' side?\" asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\n\"I don't know exactly how it happened,\" said Professor McGonagall distractedly. \"It's all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .\"\n\"I do,\" said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. \"So they got in through the Room of Requirement.\"\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\n\"I messed up, Harry,\" said Ron bleakly. \"We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder's Map and we couldn't see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it... but Malfoy got past us.\"\n\"He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,\" said Ginny. \"He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -\"\n\"His Hand of Glory,\" said Ron. \"Gives light only to the holder, remember?\"\n\"Anyway,\" Ginny went on, \"he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -\"\n\"- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,\" said Ron bitterly. \"Fred and George's. I'm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.\"\n\"We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,\" said Ginny. \"Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn't dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we'd reached a corridor that was light, they'd gone.\"\n\"Luckily,\" said Lupin hoarsely, \"Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn't expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -\"\n\"To set off the Mark?\" asked Harry.\n\"He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,\" said Lupin. \"But I don't think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.\"\n\"So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,\" said Harry, turning to Hermione, \"were you - ?\"\n\"Outside Snape's office, yes,\" whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, \"with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn't know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map-----It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don't think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape's office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -\" \"What?\" Harry urged her.\n\"I was so stupid, Harry!\" said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. \"He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -\" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. \"We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, it's so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn't realize, Harry, we didn", "PPL": 6.909311771392822, "PPL/lower": 0.9956880637427181, "PPL/zlib": 0.002081118003431573, "Min-5%": 36.799399918200926, "Min-10%": 31.510164017770805, "Min-20%": 24.92939557306341, "Min-30%": 20.167635772437926, "Min-40%": 16.589307197440224, "Min-50%": 13.748318270038183, "Min-60%": 11.514579046302224}, {"text": "pet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure all the: portraits around the room were listening closely to every wore! Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been injuries.\n    'I know how you're feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore very quietly.\n    'No, you don't,' said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings.\n    'You see, Dumbledore?' said Phineas Nigellus slyly. 'Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own - '\n    That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore.\n    Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play . . . he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been . . . Harry had never asked him . . .\n    There  is  no  shame   in  what  you  are   feeling,  Harry,'  said Dumbledore's voice. 'On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.'\n    Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words.\n    'My greatest strength, is it?' said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. 'You haven't got a clue . . . you don't know . . .\"\n    'What don't I know?' asked Dumbledore calmly.\n    It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.\n    'I don't want to talk about how I feel, all right?'\n    'Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human - '\n    'THEN - I - DON'T - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN!' Harry roared, and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, 'Really!'\n    'I DON'T CARE!' Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. 'I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANY MORE - '\n    He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.\n    'You do care,' said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. 'You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.'\n    'I - DON'T!' Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself.\n    'Oh, yes, you do,' said Dumbledore, still more calmly. 'You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.'\n    'YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL!' Harry roared. 'YOU - STANDING THERE - YOU - '\n    But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He turned on his heel and ran to the door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it.\n    But the door would not open.\n    Harry turned back to Dumbledore.\n    'Let me out,' he said. He was shaking from head to foot.\n    'No,' said Dumbledore simply.\n    For a few seconds they stared at each other.\n    'Let me out,' Harry said again.\n    'No,' Dumbledore repeated.\n    'If you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don't let me - '\n    'By all means continue destroying my possessions,' said Dumbledore serenely. 'I daresay I have too many.'\n    He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching Harry.\n    'Let me out,' Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore's.\n    'Not until I have had my say,' said Dumbledore.\n    'Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY!' Harry roared. 'I don't want to hear anything you've got to say!'\n    'You will,' said Dumbledore steadily. 'Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.'\n    'What are you talking - ?'\n    'It is my fault that Sirius died,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'Or should I say, almost entirely my fault - I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.'\n    Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.\n    'Please sit down,' said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.\n    Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledore's desk.\n    'Am I to understand,' said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left, 'that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?'\n    'Yes, Phineas,' said Dumbledore.\n    'I don't believe it,' said Phineas brusquely.\n    Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house . . .\n    'Harry, I owe you an explanation,' said Dumbledore. 'An explanation of an old man's mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have forgotten, lately . . .'\n    The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace.\n    'I guessed, fifteen years ago,' said Dumbledore, 'when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.'\n    'You've told me this before, Professor,' said Harry bluntly. He did not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much any more.\n    'Yes,' said Dumbledore apologetically.

'Have a present.' \nHe threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. \n'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. \n'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. \n'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. \n'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...' \nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. \n'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ... \n'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ... \n'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. \n'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!' \n'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ...\" \nRon looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. \nHarry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon, \n'Ready?' he said to Ron. \nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face. \n'Ron? Breakfast.' \n'I'm not hungry,' \nHarry stared ai him. \n'I thought you just said -?' \n-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.' \nHarry scrutinised him suspiciously. \n'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?' \n'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.' \n'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. \n'Harry!' said Ron suddenly. \n'What?' \n'Harry, I can't stand it!' \n'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. \n'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely. \nHarry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down. \n'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. \n'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture. \n'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?' \nRon blinked. \n'Who are you talking about?' \nWho are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. \n'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.' \nT think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice. \n'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.' \n'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -' \n'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.' \nHe turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. \nHarry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\icorpus!\nRon yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him. \n'What was that for?' Harry bellowed. \n'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. \n'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?' \nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. \n'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?' \n'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?' \n'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?' \n'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!' \n'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!' \nBut only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. \n'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?' \nHarry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another p", "PPL": 7.035017967224121, "PPL/lower": 1.0438143739095613, "PPL/zlib": 0.0021208977893349776, "Min-5%": 36.82582146513696, "Min-10%": 31.139567580877564, "Min-20%": 24.806376650747286, "Min-30%": 20.347023216831566, "Min-40%": 16.849500619986237, "Min-50%": 13.978182877380243, "Min-60%": 11.720472797181106}, {"text": "f hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three.\n    'All those poor elves I haven't set free yet, having to stay here over Christmas because there aren't enough hats!'\n    Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: :But you're coming too! Didn't I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!'\n    Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.\n    Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend: 'HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!'\n    Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual.\n    'Hello,' she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. These are nice, did you put them up?'\n    'No,' said Harry, 'it was Dobby the house-elf.'\n    'Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head. He jumped out from under it. 'Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously. 'It's often infested with Nargles.'\n    Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.\n    'Well,' said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, 'we've finally replaced you.'\n    'Replaced me?' said Harry blankly.\n    You and Fred and George,' she said impatiently. 'We've got another Seeker!'\n    'Who?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Ginny Weasley,' said Katie.\n    Harry gaped at her.\n    'Yeah, I know,' said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, 'but she's pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,' she said, throwing him a very dirty look, 'but as we can't have you . . .'\n    Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?\n    'And what about the Beaters? he asked, trying to keep his voice even.\n    'Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, 'and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up . . .'\n    The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina's burning, reproachful looks.\n    'OK,' he said, calling them all to order. 'I thought this evening we should just go over the things we've done so far, because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no poin: starting anything new right before a three-week break - '\n    'We're not doing anything new?' said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. 'If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come.'\n    'We're all really sorry Harry didn't tell you, then,' said Fred loudly.\n    Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\n    ' - we can practise in pairs,' said Harry. 'We'll start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.'\n    They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of intermittent cries of 'Impedimenta!' People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.\n    Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times.\n    After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over.\n    Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.\n    At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.\n    'You're getting really good,' he said, beaming around at them. 'When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses.'\n    There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a 'Happy Christmas' as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a 'Merry Christmas' from her.\n    'No, you go on,' he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam's apple.\n    He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.\n    He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.\n    'Wha-?'\n    He didn't know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying silently.\n    'What's up?' he said, feebly.\n    She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.\n    'I'm - sorry,' she said thickly. 'I suppose . . . it's just . . . learning all this stuff . . . it just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he'd known it all . . . he'd still be alive.'\n    Harry's heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk about Cedric.\n    'He did know this stuff,' Harry said heavily.

Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\" one of them shouted. \"I'm a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, you're not!\" yelled his friend. \"You're a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . . .\n\u3000\u3000but I'm a vampire hunter, I've killed about ninety so far -\"\n\u3000\u3000A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \"Did I tell you I've invented a broomstick that'll reach Jupiter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We'll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\n\u3000\u3000The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\n\u3000\u3000Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\n\u3000\u3000They looked at one another, surprised.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - there's a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .\n\u3000\u3000Bagman swore loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\n\u3000\u3000\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope the others are okay,\" said Hermione after a while.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be fine,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \"He's always said he'd like to get something on him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That'd wipe the smirk off old Draco's face, all right,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Those poor Muggles, though,\" said Hermione nervously. \"What if they can't get them down?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They will,\" said Ron reassuringly. \"They'll find a way.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic's out here tonight!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they've been drinking, or are they just -\"\n\u3000\u3000But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello?\" called Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's there?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.\n\u3000\u3000\"MORSMORDRE!\"\n\u3000\u3000And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"What the - ?\" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.\n\u3000\u3000Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn't understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn't see anyone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's there?\" he called again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, come on, move!\" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the Dark Mark, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.\n\u3000\u3000\"You-Know-Who's sign!\"\n\u3000", "PPL": 0.30880382657051086, "PPL/lower": 0.33541900276836145, "PPL/zlib": 9.323787034133782e-05, "Min-5%": 5.972485562749937, "Min-10%": 3.0859957450781677, "Min-20%": 1.5444349939189168, "Min-30%": 1.029305113533342, "Min-40%": 0.7727168007929871, "Min-50%": 0.617897748841795, "Min-60%": 0.5147542331553804}, {"text": "the Ministry of Magic . . . it must have been that one, it's too much of a coincidence!'\n    'How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he's on our side?' said Ron.\n    'Well, I don't know,' Hermione admitted. That is a bit odd . . .'\n    'So what's in the Department of Mysteries?' Harry asked Ron. 'Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?'\n    'I know they call the people who work in there \"Unspeakables\",' said Ron, frowning.

'It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect . . . Harry, are you sure you're all right?'\n    For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it.\n    'Yeah . . . fine . . .' he said, lowering his hands, which were trembling. 'I just feel a bit . . . I don't like Occlumency much.'\n    I expect anyone would feel snaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,' said Hermione sympathetically. 'Look, let's get back to the common room, we'll be a bit more comfortable there.'\n    But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.\n    'Headless Hats!' shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now!'\n    Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.\n    Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.\n    'And off again!' shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.\n    'How do those hats work, then?' said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely. 'I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object . . . I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though.'\n    Harry did not answer; he was feeling ill.\n    'I'm going to have to do this tomorrow,' he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.\n    'Well, write it in your homework planner then!' said Hermione encouragingly. 'So you don't forget!'\n    Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively.\n    'Don't leave it till later, you big second-rater!' chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge's homework. Hermione beamed at it.\n    'I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.\n    He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys' dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.\n    He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where be was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own name.\n    Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears . . . he was happier than he had been in a very long time . . . jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant . . . a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened . . .\n    'Harry? HARRY!'\n    Someone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued . . .\n    He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realised this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.\n    'What happened?' he said.\n    'I . . . dunno . . .' Harry gasped, sitting up again. 'He's really happy . . . really happy . . .'\n    'You-Know-Who is?'\n    'Something good's happened,' mumbled Harry. He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr Weasley and felt very sick. 'Something he's been hoping for.'\n    The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time.\n    'Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. 'She says your defences will be low at the moment, after Snape's been fiddling around with your mind . . . still, I suppose it'll help in the long run, won't it?' He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully. He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years.\n- CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE -\nThe Beetle at Bay\nHarry's question was answered the very next morning. When Hermione's Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.\n    'What?' said Harry and Ron together.\n    For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.\n    Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.\n    Algernon Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He Who Must Not Be Named.\n    But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her beauty.\n    Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent mca-pacitation of Frank and Alice LongbotWm.\n    Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.\nMASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN\nMINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS 'RALLYING POINT'\nFOR OLD DEATH EATERS\n'Black?' said Harry loudly.

Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry.\n    The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.'\n    'Study what?' said Harry blankly.\n    Snape's sneer became more pronounced.\n    'Occlumency, Potter. The magical defence of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.'\n    Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defence against external penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that . . .\n    'Why do I have to study Occlu - thing?' he blurted out.\n    'Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly. 'You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'Who's going to be teaching me?'\n    Snape raised an eyebrow.\n    'I am,' he said.\n    Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting.\n    Extra lessons with Snape - what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly round at Sirius for support.\n    'Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?' asked Sirius aggressively. 'Why you?'\n    'I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily. 'I assure you I did not beg for the job.' He got to his feet. 'I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.'\n    He turned to leave, his black travelling cloak billowing behind him.\n    'Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.\n    Snape turned back to face them, sneering.\n    'I am in rather a hurry, Black. Unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time.'\n    'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up. He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. 'If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to.'\n    'How touching,' Snape sneered. 'But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?'\n    'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly.\n    'Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,' Snape said sleekly.\n    Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his wand as he went. Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius's wand-tip to his face.\n    'Sirius!' said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\n    'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '\n    'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?' whispered Snape. 'Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months?'\n    Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he?'\n    'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, 'did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn't it?'\n    Sirius raised his wand.\n    'NO!' Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them. 'Sirius, don't!'\n    'Are you calling me a coward?' roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.\n    'Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape.\n    'Harry - get - out - of - it!' snarled Sirius, pushing him aside with his free hand.\n    The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh.\n    'Cured!' he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. 'Completely cured!'\n    He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each, trying to force them apart.\n    'Merlins beard,' said Mr Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, 'what's going on here?'\n    Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses. Snape piocketed his wand, turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he looked back.\n    'Six o'clock, Monday evening, Potter.'\n    And he was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.\n    'What's been going on?' asked Mr Weasley again.\n    'Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance. 'Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends.' With what looked like an enormous effort, he smiled. 'So . . . you're cured? That's great news, really great.'\n    'Yes, isn't it?' said Mrs Weasley, leading her husband forward to a chair. 'Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in its fangs, and Arthur's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven't you, dear?' she added, rather menacingly.\n    'Yes, Molly dear,' said Mr Weasley meekly.\n    That nights meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr Weasley back amongst them. Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr Weasley their congratulations. He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place. But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance. Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.\n    'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once. Well, you won't be sorry not to have them any more, will you?'\n    'Extra lessons with Snape?' said Ron, sounding aghast. 'I'd rather have the nightmares!'\n    They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating", "PPL": 1.0194391012191772, "PPL/lower": 0.6171132765580051, "PPL/zlib": 0.0003081738516382035, "Min-5%": 16.19625282755085, "Min-10%": 9.937644355437335, "Min-20%": 5.095173593391926, "Min-30%": 3.3975741415692595, "Min-40%": 2.550806344675201, "Min-50%": 2.0397996260092506, "Min-60%": 1.6993248549330813}, {"text": "\u3000\"Where are they sleeping, then?\" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them.\n\u3000\u3000A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione's reappearance with the box of S.

It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \"Erm - where are the skrewts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\" said Hagrid happily. \"They're get-tin' massive, mus' be\n\u3000\u3000nearly three foot long now. On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no, really?\" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"S' okay, though, I've got 'em in separate boxes now. Still got abou' twenty.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's lucky,\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wait,\" he said, grinning. \"You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before. Firs' task. . . ah, but I'm not supposed ter say.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, Hagrid!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"But it's gonna be spectacular, I'll tell yeh that. Them champions're going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I'd live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\"\n\u3000\u3000They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn't eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.\n\u3000\u3000A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione,\" he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \"It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\" said Hermione. \"And we heard he's asking for wages now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it - no, nothin' doin', Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.\n\u3000\u3000By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with yeh,\" said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \"Jus' give us a sec.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn't pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \"Hagrid, what's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \"Don' yeh like it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that aftershave?\" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - eau de cologne,\" Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it's a bit much,\" he said gruffly. \"I'll go take it off, hang on...\"\n\u3000\u3000He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eau de cologne?\" said Hermione in amazement. \"Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what's with the hair and the suit?\" said Harry in an undertone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look!\" said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just straightened up and turned 'round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn't spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn't hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame\n\u3000\u3000Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before -when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's going up to the castle with her!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"I thought he was waiting for us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux-batons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\n\u3000\u3000\"He fancies her!\" said Ron incredulously. \"Well, if they end up having children, they'll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\"\n\u3000\u3000They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ooh it's them, look!\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle", "PPL": 0.8172874450683594, "PPL/lower": 0.6357051544114763, "PPL/zlib": 0.00024902115937488095, "Min-5%": 15.811222013305215, "Min-10%": 8.195373161805465, "Min-20%": 4.091633802688564, "Min-30%": 2.7259102129298363, "Min-40%": 2.043678311373751, "Min-50%": 1.6345646140177763, "Min-60%": 1.3630307052287862}, {"text": "was moving a muscle.

It seemed that Moody's rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.\n\u3000\u3000Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so!\" roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned,\" growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \"Stinking, cowardly, scummy\n\u3000\u3000thing to do...\"\n\u3000\u3000The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Never - do - that - again -\" said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody!\" said a shocked voice.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Professor McGonagall,\" said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.\n\u3000\u3000\"What - what are you doing?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret's progress through the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Teaching,\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"Teach - Moody, is that a student?\" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!\" said Professor McGonagall wealdy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He might've mentioned it, yeah,\" said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, \"but I thought a good sharp shock -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We give detentions, Moody!

Now, your Head of House'll be Snape, will it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Malfoy resentfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Another old friend,\" growled Moody. \"I've been looking forward to a chat with old Snape.\n\u3000\u3000. . . Come on, you. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000And he seized Malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't talk to me,\" Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why not?\" said Hermione in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,\" said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. \"Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.\n\u3000\u3000\"He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,\" she said. \"It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, \"you're ruining the best moment of my life!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening?\" said Harry, watching her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got to,\" said Hermione thickly. \"Loads to do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you told us Professor Vector -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not schoolwork,\" she said.

Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know why Snape's in such a foul mood, don't you?\" said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Moody.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it - but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together -at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors - he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye, whether magical or normal.\n\u3000\u3000\"I reckon Snape's a bit scared of him, you know,\" Harry said thoughtfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\" said Ron, his eyes misting over, \"and bounced him all around his dungeon...\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody's first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung.

Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks\n205\nheaving and sweaty.\n\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\n\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read\nwhat is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\nHarry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\"\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n206\n\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"\n\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\nFirenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?\"\n\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\nenough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.

But I don't understand who --\"\n\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's\nheart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\n\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n207\nbehind her.\n\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.\"\n\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\nHarry slid off his back.\n\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\nHarry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\nrich....\"\n\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\nHarry wasn't listening.\n\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written\nin the stars as well.\"\n\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\n\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry\n208\nwent on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.\"\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\nand Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.\"\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\nJust in case.\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\na desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if\nit had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\n209\nhis old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\nMaybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because", "PPL": 0.6607520580291748, "PPL/lower": 0.5769172922391953, "PPL/zlib": 0.00019107925333405865, "Min-5%": 11.281778910580803, "Min-10%": 6.551380573388408, "Min-20%": 3.3057024776912804, "Min-30%": 2.2026328708292424, "Min-40%": 1.653438038333939, "Min-50%": 1.3221337722936541, "Min-60%": 1.1014288266669758}, {"text": "'How did you get out of that?' asked Harry.\n    'Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,' said Hagrid.

At night, when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at 'em,' said Hagrid, the corners of h s mouth lifting his wild beard, 'she was rarin' ter attack 'em . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe . . . fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .'\n    Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.\n    'So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?'\n    'What? Oh . . . oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in an' headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go - then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.'\n    'Cave must've been cramped,' said Ron.\n    'Wasn' room ter swing a Kneazle,' said Hagrid.\n    'Didn't they attack you when they saw you?' asked Hermione.\n    'Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, 'but they was badly hurt, all three o' them; Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.'\n    'Six or seven?' said Ron eagerly. 'Well that's not bad - are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?'\n    But Hermione said, 'What do you mean \"at one point\", Hagrid?'\n    Hagrid looked at her sadly.\n    'Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.'\n    'So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?' said Ron, looking disappointed.\n    'Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, 'but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em . . . could be they'll come.'\n    Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap.\n    'Hagrid?' said Hermione quietly after a while.\n    'Mmm?'\n    'Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything asout your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?'\n    Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared.\n    'I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it - '\n    'Dead,' Hagrid grunted. 'Died years ago. They told me.'\n    'Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,' said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders.\n    'No need,' he said shortly. 'Can't remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.'\n    They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.\n    'But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,' Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face.\n    'Or why you're back so late,' said Harry. 'Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago - '\n    'Who attacked you?' said Ron.\n    'I haven' bin attacked!' said Hagrid emphatically.

Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-dron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room. \n  \nRon and Hermione returned in the late afternoon. \n  \n\"Harry!\" cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. \"Harry, I passed!\" \n- \n\"Well done!\" he said. \"And Ron?\" \n  \n\"He \u2014 he just failed,\" whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. \"It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he'd left half an eyebrow behind. . .

I'll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.\" \n  \n\"It's a great feeling when you take it,\" said Ron reminiscently. \"Like you can't do anything wrong.\" \n  \n\"What are you talking about?\" said Hermione, laughing. \"You've never taken any!\" \n  \n\"Yeah, but I thought I had, didn't I?\" said Ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. \"Same difference really ...\" \n  \nAs they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbid-den Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-ing carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys' dormitory. \n  \nHarry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle. \n  \n\"Well, here goes,\" said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp. \n  \n\"What does it feel like?\" whispered Hermione. \n  \nHarry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all... and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy. . . . \n  \nHe got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. \n\"Excellent,\" he said. \"Really excellent. Right. . . I'm going down to Hagrid's.\" \n  \n\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast. \n  \n\"No, Harry \u2014 you've got to go and see Slughorn, remember?\" said Hermione. \n  \n\"No,\" said Harry confidently. \"I'm going to Hagrid's, I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.\" \n  \n\"You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?\" asked Ron, looking stunned. \n  \n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \"I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?\" \n  \n\"No,\" said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now. \n  \n\"This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?\" said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. \"You haven't got another little bottle full of\u2014 I don't know \u2014\" \n  \n\"Essence of Insanity?\" suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders. \n  \nHarry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed. \n  \n\"Trust me,\" he said. \"I know what I'm doing ... or at least\" he strolled confidently to the door\u2014 \"Felix does.\" \n  \nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door. \n  \n\"What were you doing up there with her!\u201d shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories. Harry heard Ron splutter-ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them. \n  \nGetting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny. \n  \n\"Don't push me, please, Dean,\" she said, sounding annoyed. ; \"You're always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. ...\" \n  \nThe portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation in-creasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts. \n  \nWhy he knew that going to Hagrid's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the en-trance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk. \n  \nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid's. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked be-hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation. \n  \n\"I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,\" Slughorn was saying courteously, \"most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.\" \n  \n\"Oh, I quite agree,\" said Professor Sprout warmly. \"That enough for you?\" \n  \n\"Plenty, plenty,\" said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. \"This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!\" \n  \nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible. \n: \nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish. \n  \n\"Good evening, Professor.\" \n  \n\"Merlin\u2019s be", "PPL": 7.264623641967773, "PPL/lower": 1.0164578555175943, "PPL/zlib": 0.0022701948881149294, "Min-5%": 38.98568742415484, "Min-10%": 32.64995787190456, "Min-20%": 25.44216038253896, "Min-30%": 20.786851039538554, "Min-40%": 17.266332080136884, "Min-50%": 14.412452127576923, "Min-60%": 12.103493035246135}, {"text": "Ls from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.\n    She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.\n    'How many hours d'you think you're doing a day?' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.\n    'I dunno,' said Ron. 'A few.'\n    'More or less than eight?'\n    'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.\n    'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. 'Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday - '\n    Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.\n    Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.\n    'Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, 'it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years - old Griselda Marchbanks - we've had her round for dinner and everthing . . .'\n    'Do you think that's true?' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron.\n    'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily.\n    'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them. 'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's.'\n    'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict?'\n    'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice.\n    'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it?' Ron told him encouragingly.\n    'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad . . . well . . . you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\n    Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.\n    Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\n    'Hermione, we wanted to buy that!' shouted Ron.\n    'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it.'\n    'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw?' said Ron eagerly.\n    'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.'\n    'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '\n    This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly. 'I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried Doxy droppings.'\n    This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants.\n    They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson.\n    'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.\n    'Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new - Headmistress - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt '- has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - '\n    Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.\n    ' - however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.'\n    'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'\n    'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall.\n    'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays.'\n    Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought dully', at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer.\n    Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.\n    'Why don't you just do it yourself?' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.\n    Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.\n    Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate", "PPL": 0.6492468118667603, "PPL/lower": 0.5042875689251323, "PPL/zlib": 0.00018273200446573606, "Min-5%": 10.693602258083867, "Min-10%": 6.372378680343721, "Min-20%": 3.244819549406471, "Min-30%": 2.163703441694955, "Min-40%": 1.624493050205403, "Min-50%": 1.2990706868302773, "Min-60%": 1.08223952193403}, {"text": "break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.\"\nThey returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.\n\"I thought you'd get that, well done,\" she called over, pointing. at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. \"Tell me when you call trials!\"\n\"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry, \"you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .\"\n\"You mustn't start off like that,\" she said warningly. \"For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends. ...\"\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.\n\"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\"\n\"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \n\"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" \nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n\"Inside,\" he said.\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\"\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \n\"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" \nYou believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \nNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.WL. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\"\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\"\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the\nDark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\n\"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo. These pictures - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground.\n\"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using them?\"\n\"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . \" \nHe set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,\n\". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\"\nHermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \"Very well - Miss Granger?\"\n\"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,\" said Hermione, \"which gives you a split-second advantage.\"\n\"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\" said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \"but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\" -\nhis gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - \"lack.\" \nHarry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. \n\"You will now divide,\" Snape went on, \"into pairs. One partner will attempt jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\"\nAlthough Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He\nswept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.\nRon, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting\non tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\n\"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you -\"\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\"\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.\n\"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.

Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name \"U-No-Poo.\" \n  \n\"They'll be murdered in their beds!\" she whispered. \n  \n\"No they won\u2019t!\" said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. \"This is brilliant!\" \n  \nAnd he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: reusable hangman \u2014 spell it or he'll swing! \n  \n\"'Patented Daydream Charms \n  \nHermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. \n  \n\"'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,\" said Hermione, looking up at Harry, \"that really is extraordinary magic!\" \n  \n\"For that, Hermione,\" said a voice behind them, \"you can have one for free.\" \n  \nA beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair. \n  \n\"How are you, Harry?\" They shook hands. \"And what's happened to your eye, Hermione?\" \n  \n\"Your punching telescope,\" she said ruefully. \n  \n\"Oh blimey, I forgot about those,\" said Fred. \"Here \u2014\" \n  \nHe pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste. \n  \n\"Just dab it on, that bruise'll be gone within the hour,\" said Fred. \"We had to find a decent bruise remover. We're testing most of our products on ourselves.\" \n  \nHermione looked nervous. \"It is safe, isn't it?\" she asked. \n  \n'\"Course it is,\" said Fred bracingly. \"Come on, Harry, I'll give you a tour.\" \n  \nHarry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. \n  \n\"Muggle magic tricks!\" said Fred happily, pointing them out. \"For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It's not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they're great novelties. . . . Oh, here's George. ...\" \n  \nFred's twin shook Harrys hand energetically. \n  \n\"Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that's where we're making the real money\u2014pocket anything, you, and you'll pay in more than Galleons!\" he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark \n  \nMARKS----THEY'LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! \n  \nGeorge pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued. \n  \n\"We've just developed this more serious line,\" said Fred. \"Funny how it happened . . .\" \n  \n\"You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,\" said George. \"'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry.\" \n  \n\"That's right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!\" \n  \n\"So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves ...\" \n  \n\"... I mean, they wouldn't help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . .\" \n  \n\"And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner,\" continued George enthusiastically. \"This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we're importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make \n  \na quick escape.\" \n  \n\"And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. \"You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one. \n  \n\"Handy,\" said Harry, impressed. \n  \n\"Here,\" said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry. \n  \nA young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes. \n  \n\"There's a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,\" she said. \n  \nHarry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called \"Mr. Weasley,\" but they took it in their stride. \n  \n\"Right you are, Verity, I'm coming,\" said George promptly. \"Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.\" \n  \n\"I can't do that!\" said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. \n  \n\"You don't pay here,\" said Fred firmly, waving away Harry's gold. \n  \n\"But\u2014\" \n  \n\"You gave us our start-up loan, we haven't forgotten,\" said George sternly \"Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.\" \n  \nGeorge swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms. \n  \n\"Haven't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?\" asked Fred. \"Follow me, ladies. . . .\" \n  \nNear the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary. \n  \n\"There you go,\" said Fred proudly. \"Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere.\" \n  \nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. \"Do they work?\" she asked.

Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face. 'So she can speak freely?'\n    'I have not yet managed to find one,' Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione's jinxing ability 'But it doesn't matter if she won't speak, I can take up the story from here.\n    'You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade - '\n    'And what is your evidence for that?' cut in Professor McGonagall\n    'I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly 'He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - '\n    'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!' said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. 'What an interesting insight into our justice system!'\n    'Blatant corruption!' roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk. The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!'\n    Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,' said Dumbledore softly.\n    The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, 'was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age - '\n    'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose.\n    Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it.\n    'Oho!' said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. 'Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on - '\n    Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors?'\n    Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.\n    'Oh, very good, Minister, very good!'\n    Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too.\n    'Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - 'that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head.'\n    Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.\n    Umbridge recovered first.\n    That's all very fine, Headmaster,' she said, smiling sweetly, 'but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.'\n    'Well,' said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, 'they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued?'\n    As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn, too, that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draught or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.\n    'Evidence?' repeated Umbridge, with that horrible wide toad-like smile. 'Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?'\n    'Oh, can she tell us about six months' worth of meetings?' said Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. 'I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.'\n    'Miss Edgecombe,' said Umbridge at once, 'tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I'm sure that won't make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?'\n    Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside.\n    'Just nod or shake your head, dear,' Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, 'come on, now, that won't re-activate the jinx.'\n    Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face. Only her eyes were visible between the pulled-up robes and her curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank. And then - to Harry's utter amazement - 'Marietta shook her head.\n    Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge, then back at Marietta.\n    'I don't think you understood the question, did you, dear? I'm asking whether you've been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven't you?'\n    Again, Marietta shook her head.\n    'What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?' said Umbridge in a testy voice.\n    'I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,' said Professor McGonagall harshly, 'there have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?'\n    Marietta nodded.\n    'But there was a meeting tonight!' said Umbridge furiously. There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organised it, Potter - why are you shaking your head, girl?'\n    'Well, usually when a person shakes their head,' said McGonagall coldly, 'they mean \"no\". So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign-language as yet unknown to humans - '\n    Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.\n    'I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,' said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry.\n    'You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,' said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice. 'You don't want to get yourself into trouble, now.'\n    'No,' said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. 'I mean, yes - you're right, Shacklebolt - I - I forgot myself.'\n    Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her. She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack, nor relieved by her release; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her.\n    A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him, sprang into Harry's mind.\n    'Dolores,' said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, 'the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - '\n    'Yes,' said Umbridge, pulling herself together, 'yes . . . well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed.

But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. \n\"Certainly we could,\" said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \"Why don't you do it?\" \n\"Me? Oh . . . okay . . .\" Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, \"Accio Horcrux!\" \nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \n\"What was that?\" \n\"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\" \nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding. \n\"Did you think that would happen, sir?\" \n\"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\" \n\"But we don't know what the thing was,\" said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. \n\"What the things are, you mean,\" said Dumbledore. \"I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\" \n\"Professor?\" \n\"Yes, Harry?\" \n\"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?\" \n\"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\" \n\"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\" \n\"Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\" And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. \n\"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\" \n\"Yes, I think so.\" Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . . \n\"Aha,\" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. \"So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\" \nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-thing invisible. \n\"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumble-dore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. \nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. \n\"How did you know that was there?\" Harry asked in astonish-ment. \n\"Magic always leaves traces,\" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \"sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\" \n\"Is ... is this boat safe?\" \n\"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\" \n\"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort's boat?\" \n\"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\" \n\"But why have they let us?\" asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. \n\"Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right.\" \nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. \"It doesn't look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\" \nDumbledore chuckled. \"Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\" \n\"But then \u2014 ?\" \n\"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \"Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\" Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which be-gan to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rus-tle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves. \nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . . \nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. \"Professor!\" he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water. \n\"Harry?\" \n\"I think I saw a hand in the water \u2014 a human hand!\" \n\"Yes, I am sure you did,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. \n\"So that thing that jumped out of the water \u2014 ?\" But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. \"There are bodies in here!\" said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own. \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore placidly, \"but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\" \n\"At the moment?\" Harry repeated", "PPL": 7.436380863189697, "PPL/lower": 1.0031023370506018, "PPL/zlib": 0.002241899566834398, "Min-5%": 39.574399854622634, "Min-10%": 33.146908171036664, "Min-20%": 25.914857943658433, "Min-30%": 21.137723914963416, "Min-40%": 17.5565789736862, "Min-50%": 14.691035738438805, "Min-60%": 12.381654365152023}, {"text": "though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.\n    Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.\n    Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started.\n    'Just do it tomorrow!' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. 'Come on, I'm starving.'\n    'I won't be long . . . look, you go ahead . . .\"\n    But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort's return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all . . .\n    Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.\n    He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. 'Use it if you need me, all right?'\n    Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.\n    He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.\nThis is a two-way mirror, I've got the other one of the pair. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.\nHarry's heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it - '\n    He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, 'Sirius.'\n    His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.\n    He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:\n    'Sirius Black!'\n    Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own . . .\n    Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry's head. That's why it's riot working . . .\n    Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again . . .\n    Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror - '\n    But then an idea struck him . . . a better idea than a mirror . . . a much bigger, more important idea . . . how had he never thought of it before - why had he never asked?\n    He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: The feast is about to start, you know, you're cutting it very fine!'\n    But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .\n    How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn't need one, yet now . . .\n    He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast . . .\n    But just as he had given up hope, he saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor.\n    'Hey - hey, Nick! NICK!'\n    The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.\n    'Good evening,' he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. 'I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,' he sighed, 'in a rather different sense, of course . . .'\n    'Nick, can I ask you something?'\n    A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.\n    'Er - now, Harry?' said Nick, looking discomfited. 'Can't it wait until after the feast?'\n    'No - Nick - please,' said Harry, 'I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?'\n    Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.\n    'Oh, very well,' he said, looking resigned. 'I can't pretend I haven't been expecting it.'\n    Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead.\n    'Expecting what?' Harry asked, as he closed the door.\n    'You to come and find me,' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. 'It happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.'\n    'Well,' said Harry, refusing to be deflected. 'You were right, I've - I've come to find you.'\n    Nick said nothing.\n    'It's - ' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, 'it's just - you're dead. But you're still here, aren't you?'\n    Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.\n    That's right, isn't it?' Harry urged him. 'You died, but I'm talking to you . . . you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can't you?'\n    'Yes,' said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, 'I walk and talk, yes.'\n    'So, you came back, didn't you?' said Harry urgently. 'People can come back, right? As ghosts. They don't have to disappear completely. Well?' he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.\n    Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, 'Not everyone can come back as a ghost.'\n    'What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Only . . . only wizards.'\n    'Oh,' said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. 'Well, that's OK then, the person I'm asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?'\n    Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.\n    'He won't come back.'\n    Who?'\n    'Sirius Black,' said Nick.\n    'But you did!' said Harry angrily.

The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\n\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\nHarry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\" \"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\"\n53\n\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter.\"\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\"\n\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\n\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\n\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\nBut the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\nDoris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\n54\nwas tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\" \"Is he always that nervous?\"\n\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\nstudyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?\"\nVampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\nThe brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a\nsmall hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\nHe grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\nback into solid wall.\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring\n-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\"\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at\nonce: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad....\"\n55\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion\nbottles, globes of the moon.... \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -\n\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\nA treasure that was never yours,\nThief, you have been warned, beware\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n56\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing\ncoins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these.

Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final desti-nation and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. \nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up \nat the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. \nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. \nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. \nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \n\"You're not welcome.\" \nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \n\"Er \u2014 good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic \u2014\" \"You're not welcome.\" \n\"Er \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. \nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \n\"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden \u2014 ?\" \nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-denly understood. \n\"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \n\"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. \nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \n\"Now, look \u2014\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \n\"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. \nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \n\"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \n\"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \n\"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \n\"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \n\"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" \nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \n\"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \n\"At, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \n\"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. \nHe squinted into Ogdens lace and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \n\"I don't doubt it, if your sons been let loose on them,\" said Og-den. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \n\"Inside?\" \n\"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl \u2014\" \n\"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \n\"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of vis-itors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning \u2014\" \n\"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" \nThe house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: \nHissy, hissy, little snakey, \nSlither on the floor \nYou be good to Morfin \nOr he'll nail you to the door. \nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open win-dow, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone \nwall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \n\"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked \ninquiringly toward her.

He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat.

Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody's bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody?\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went to help this morning?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Must be,\" said Ron in a low, awed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened to him?\" Hermione whispered. \"What happened to his face?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno,\" Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.\n\u3000\u3000Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"As I was saying,\" he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \"we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're JOKING!\" said Fred Weasley loudly.\n\u3000\u3000The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\" he said, \"though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - but maybe this is not the time.. . no. . .\" said Dumbledore, \"where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament. . . well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities -until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Death toll?\" Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.\n\u3000\u3000\"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore continued, \"none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.\n\u3000\u3000\"The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going for it!\" Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,\" he said,\n\u3000\u3000\"the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age - that is to say, seventeen years or older - will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This\" -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious - \"is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hog-warts champion.\" His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred's and George's mutinous faces. \"I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.\n\u3000\u3000\"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't do that!\" said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. \"We're seventeen in April, why can't we have a shot?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They're not stopping me entering,\" said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table.\n\u3000\u3000\"The champions'll get to do all sorts of stuff you'd never be allowed to do normally.\n\u3000\u3000And a thousand Galleons prize money!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \"Yeah, a thousand Galleons. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on,\" said Hermione, \"we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's this impartial judge who's going to decide who the champions are?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno,\" said Fred, \"but it's them we'll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George.. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore knows you're not of age, though,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but he's not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?\" said Fred shrewdly. \"Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he'll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are.

Incarcerous!\" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \"Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul... \nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around. \nDumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surround-ing Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . . \nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. \nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. \n\"Sir,\" panted Harry, \"sir, I forgot \u2014 about fire \u2014 they were coming at me and I panicked \u2014\" \n\"Quite understandable,\" murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. \nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. \n\"I am weak...\" he said. \n\"Don't worry, sir,\" said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. \"Don't worry, I'll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .\" \nAnd pulling Dumbledore's uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight. \n\"The protection was . . . after all... well-designed,\" said Dum-bledore faintly. \"One alone could not have done it. ... You did well, very well, Harry. ...\" \n\"Don't talk now,\" said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore's voice had become, how much his feet dragged. \"Save your energy, sir. . . . We'll soon be out of here. . . .\" \n\"The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife ...\" ' \n\"There's no need, I got cut on the rock,\" said Harry firmly. \"Just tell me where. . . .\" \n\"Here . . .\" \nHarry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-ceived its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. \n\"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \"We're nearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back . . . Don't worry. . . .\" \n\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\" \n\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n\n\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression. \nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows. \n'We did it, Professor!' Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!' \nDumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp. \n'Sir, are you all right?' \n'I've been better,' said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no health drink ...\" \nAnd to Harry's horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground. \n'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -' \nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing. \n'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...' \n'No,' said Dumbledore. 'It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...' \n'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -' \n'Severus,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'I need Severus ...' \n'All right then, Snape - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -' \nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard run- ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with", "PPL": 7.013631343841553, "PPL/lower": 0.9913942323603097, "PPL/zlib": 0.0021246989832903827, "Min-5%": 34.90793867672191, "Min-10%": 29.84405902787751, "Min-20%": 23.924262254337226, "Min-30%": 19.77217213261011, "Min-40%": 16.48994461539905, "Min-50%": 13.835148298029559, "Min-60%": 11.674367070537825}, {"text": "She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.\n\u3000\u3000Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pain,\" said Moody softly. \"You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right. . . anyone know any others?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone's faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes?\" said Moody, looking at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra,\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \"Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra. .. the Killing Curse.\"\n\u3000\u3000He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.\n\u3000\u3000Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra!\" Moody roared.\n\u3000\u3000There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\n\u3000\u3000Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not nice,\" he said calmly. \"Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all....\n\u3000\u3000So that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry's father first.\n\u3000\u3000How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry.. . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents' voices when he had fought the\n\u3000\u3000dementors last year - for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair.\n\u3000\u3000Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, if there's no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you've got to know.\n\u3000\u3000You've got to appreciate what the worst is. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\" he roared, and the whole class jumped again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . .\n\u3000\u3000.\"\n\u3000\u3000They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang - but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices - \"Did you see it twitch?\" \"- and when he killed it - just like that!\"\n\u3000\u3000They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn't found it very entertaining - and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry up,\" she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not the ruddy library again?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. \"Neville.\" Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville?\" Hermione said gently.\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh hello,\" he said, his voice much higher than usual. \"Interesting lesson, wasn't it?\n\u3000\u3000I wonder what's for dinner, I'm - I'm starving, aren't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville, are you all right?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes, I'm fine,\" Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. \"Very interesting dinner - I mean lesson - what's for eating?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gave Harry a startled look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville, what - ?\"\n\u3000\u3000But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, sonny,\" he said to Neville. \"Why don't you come up to my office? Come on. . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You all right, are you, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, almost defiantly.\n\u3000\u3000Moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he said, \"You've got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you've got to know. No point pretending. . . well.. . come on, Longbottom, I've got some books that might interest you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn't say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody's gnarled hands on his shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that about?\" said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"", "PPL": 0.5462135672569275, "PPL/lower": 0.656444083889835, "PPL/zlib": 0.00016811744144565327, "Min-5%": 10.23847982930202, "Min-10%": 5.464309719628563, "Min-20%": 2.732933593088474, "Min-30%": 1.820854337887777, "Min-40%": 1.3668338489778118, "Min-50%": 1.0929514342583757, "Min-60%": 0.9105018103849356}, {"text": "please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\" \nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \n\"What happened when Katie touched the necklace?\" \n\"She rose up in the air,\" said Harry, before either Ron or Hermi-one could speak, \"and then began to scream, and collapsed. Profes-sor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\" \n\"The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. \n\"Away?\" Harry repeated angrily. \n\"Yes, Potter, away!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"But any-thing you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I'm sure!\" \nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at. \n\"I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\" ; \nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embar-rassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry. \n\"That is a very serious accusation, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \"Do you have any proof?\" \n\"No,\" said Harry, \"but.. .\" and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had over-heard between him and Mr. Borgin. \nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused. \n\"Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\" \n\"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But that's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace \u2014\" \n\"You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\" \n\"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him \u2014\" \n\"But Harry,\" Hermione interrupted, \"Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no \u2014\" \n\"Because he didn't want to touch it, obviously!\" said Harry angrily. \n\"What he actually said was, 'How would I look carrying that down the street?'\" said Hermione. \n\"Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,\" inter-jected Ron. \n\"Oh, Ron,\" said Hermione despairingly, \"it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn't have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street \u2014 and in any case,\" she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \"I asked Borgin about the necklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn't say it was already sold or anything \u2014\" \n\"Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn't going to tell you \u2014 anyway, Malfoy could've sent off for it since \u2014\" \n\"That's enough!\" said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. \"Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people \u2014\" \n\"\u2014 that's what I said \u2014\" muttered Ron. \n\"\u2014 and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have en-tered this school without our knowledge \u2014\" \n\"But \u2014\" \n\"\u2014 and what is more,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \"Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.\" \nHarry gaped at her, deflating. \n\"How do you know, Professor?\" \n\"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\" she said as she marched past them, \"but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\" \nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word. \nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; \nnevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started dis-cussing what had happened. \n\"So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room. \n\"Goodness only knows,\" said Hermione. \"But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.\" \n\"It could've been meant for loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore \u2014 the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn \u2014 Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can't be pleased that he's sided with Dumbledore. Or \u2014\" \n\"Or you,\" said Hermione, looking troubled. \n\"Couldn't have been,\" said Harry, \"or Katie would've just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn't she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?\" \n\"Harry, Malfoy wasn't in Hogsmeade!\" said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration. \n\"He must have used an accomplice, then,\" said Harry. \"Crabbe or Goyle \u2014 or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he'll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he's joined up \u2014\" \nRon and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There's no point arguing with him. \n\"Dilligrout,\" said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady. \nThe portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie's fate had not yet spread. \n\"It wasn't a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,\" said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. \"The curse didn't even make it into the castle. Not what you'd call foolproof.\" \n\"You're right,\" said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. \"It wasn't very well thought-out at all.\" \n\"But since when has Malfoy been one of the world's great thinkers?\" asked Harry. \nNeither Ron nor Hermione answered him. \n\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\n\n\nKatie was removed to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target. \n\"Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,\" said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. \nHarry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night's lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore's office at eight o'clock, knocked, and was told to enter.

Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\"\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?\"\nHarry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\n245\nstanding up to look at him.\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get\nthem nice and empty before next year starts....\n\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...\n\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\"\nAt last there was silence again.\n\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\n246\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted\nfrom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\n\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\nIt was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\n247\nnever, ever forget tonight.\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out\nof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I'll send you an owl.\"\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\"Bye, Harry!\"\n\"See you, Potter!\"\n\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\n\"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"\n248\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.\n\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\"\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\"Busy year?\" she said.\n\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"\n\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \"Ready, are you?\"\nIt was Uncle", "PPL": 0.4411764442920685, "PPL/lower": 0.3983892275071696, "PPL/zlib": 0.00012706694824080313, "Min-5%": 8.727265062869764, "Min-10%": 4.4209844390542115, "Min-20%": 2.2073622422166452, "Min-30%": 1.470675371586518, "Min-40%": 1.1039804062703031, "Min-50%": 0.8827734508265335, "Min-60%": 0.7354109359606386}, {"text": "and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage.\n\u3000\u3000\"The second step you must take - and at once,\" Dumbledore pressed on, \"is to send envoys to the giants.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Envoys to the giants?\" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. \"What madness is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,\" said Dumbledore, \"or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You - you cannot be serious!\" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore. \"If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants -people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are blinded,\" said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, \"by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius!\n\u3000\u3000You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood!

Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry's bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore, \"we have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I - I shall act as I see fit.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, see here, Dumbledore,\" he said, waving a threatening finger. \"I've given you free rein, always. I've had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet. There aren't many who'd have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you're going to work against me -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The only one against whom I intend to work,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.\"\n\u3000\u3000It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, \"He can't be back, Dumbledore, he just can't be ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\n\u3000\u3000\"There,\" said Snape harshly. \"There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape's arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \"I don't know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your winnings,\" he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harrys bedside table. \"One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances .. .\"\n\u3000\u3000He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is work to be done,\" he said. \"Molly... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course you can,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute. \"We know what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then I need to send a message to Arthur,\" said Dumbledore. \"All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact\n\u3000\u3000those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll go to Dad,\" said Bill, standing up. \"I'll go now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent,\" said Dumbledore. \"Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Leave it to me,\" said Bill.\n\u3000\u3000He clapped a hand on Harry's shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Minerva,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, \"I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also - if she will consent to come - Madame Maxime.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\n\u3000\u3000\"Poppy,\" Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, \"would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moodys office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very - very well,\" said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey's footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And now,\" he said, \"it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.\"\n\u3000\u3000The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius Black!\" she shrieked, pointing at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum, shut up!\" Ron yelled. \"It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face", "PPL": 0.5117861032485962, "PPL/lower": 0.5108764825887745, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001552749099662003, "Min-5%": 9.790716102310256, "Min-10%": 5.123714090854514, "Min-20%": 2.5607056392511596, "Min-30%": 1.7060824681962847, "Min-40%": 1.2806804076288885, "Min-50%": 1.024063035628477, "Min-60%": 0.853113306826885}, {"text": "it is to clean all the time - we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to SPEW, it would raise awareness as well as funds.'\n    'I'll sponsor you to shut up about SPEW,' Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him.\n*\nHarry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.\n    The fact as that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he'd experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.\n    On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig's owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\n    'Booklists have arrived,' he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. 'About time, I thought they'd forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .'\n    Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron's head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.\n    'Only two new ones,' he said, reading the list, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.'\n    Crack.\n    Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn't even fall off his chair.\n    'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally\n    'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George.\n    'And about time too,' said Fred.\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry asked, jumping down beside them.\n    Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'\n    'Not surprising, is it, when you look at what's happened to the last four?' said George.\n    'One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. 'Yeah, I see what you mean.'\n    'What's up with you, Ron?' asked Fred.\n    Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\n    'What's the matter?' said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.\n    Fred's mouth fell open, too.\n    'Prefect?' he said, staring incredulously at the letter. 'Prefect?'\n    George leapt forwards, seized the envelope in Ron's other hand and turned it upside-down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George's palm.\n    'No way,' said George in a hushed voice.\n    'There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark. 'No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect.'\n    The twins' heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.\n    'We thought you were a cert!' said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.\n    'We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!' said George indignantly.\n    'Winning the Triwizard and everything!' said Fred.\n    'I suppose all the mad stuff must've counted against him,' said George to Fred.\n    'Yeah,' said Fred slowly. 'Yeah, you've caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you's got their priorities right.'\n    He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look.\n    'Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the Prefect.'\n    'Ohh, Mum's going to be revolting,' groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.\n    Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large 'P' was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy's chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.\n    The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.\n    'Did you - did you get - ?'\n    She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek.\n    'I knew it!' she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. 'Me too, Harry, me too!'\n    'No,' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand. 'It's Ron, not me.'\n    'It - what?'\n    'Ron's prefect, not me,' Harry said.\n    'Ron?' said Hermione, her jaw dropping. 'But . . . are you sure? I mean - '\n    She turned red as Ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace.\n    'It's my name on the letter,' he said.\n    'I . . .' said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. 'I . . . well . . . wow! Well done, Ron! That's really - '\n    'Unexpected,' said George, nodding.\n    'No,' said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, 'no it's not . . . Ron's done loads of . . . he's really . . .'\n    The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs Weasley bucked into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.\n    'Ginny said the booklists had come at last,' she said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles. 'If you give them to me I'll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you're packing. Ron, I'll have to get you more pyjamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can't believe how fast you're growing . . . what colour would you like?'\n    'Get him red and gold to match his badge,' said George, smirking.\n    'Match his what?' said Mrs Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on Ron's pile.\n    'His badge,' said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly. 'His lovely shiny new prefect's badge.'\n    Fred's words took a moment to penetrate Mrs Weasley's preoccupation with pyjamas.\n    'His . . . but . . . Ron, you're not . . .?'\n    Ron held up his badge.\n    Mrs Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione's.\n    'I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!'\n    'What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?' said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her", "PPL": 0.7239205241203308, "PPL/lower": 0.5469344595741094, "PPL/zlib": 0.00021936985579403963, "Min-5%": 12.575603055019005, "Min-10%": 7.178825681700426, "Min-20%": 3.619424952305671, "Min-30%": 2.4127688366519315, "Min-40%": 1.8113928462339828, "Min-50%": 1.4485029297805039, "Min-60%": 1.2067187855244477}, {"text": ".\n    'Potter and Chang!' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. 'Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste . . . at least Diggory was good-looking!'\n    The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n    'So . . . where d'you want to go?' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n    'Oh . . . I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 'Urn . . . shall we just have a look in the shops or something?'\n    They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, 'By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n    It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, 'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere . . .'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. 'Yeah, that is weird.\n    He wasn't sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. The) had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them . . . it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n    The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed. Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck.\n    'Um . . . d'you want to get a coffee?' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around. 'Where?'\n    'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbndge's office.\n    'Cute, isn't it?' said Cho happily.\n    'Er . . . yeah,' said Harry untruthfully.\n    'Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day!' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n    'Aaah . . .'\n    They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that t was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n    'What can I get you, m'dears?' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty.\n    Two coffees, please,' said Cho.\n    In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.\n    After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during DA meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.\n    'Er . . . listen, d'you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I'm meeting Hermione Granger there.'\n    Cho raised her eyebrows.\n    'You're meeting Hermione Granger? Today?'\n    'Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D'you want to come with me? She said it wouldn't matter if you did.'\n    'Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.'\n    But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all. On the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding.\n    A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Beside them,\n    Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips.\n    Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest, just reach out and grab it. Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . .\n    But just as he moved his hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.\n    'He asked me out, you know,' she said in a quiet voice. 'A couple: of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.'\n    Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come: out with him?\n    He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.\n    'I came in here with Cedric last year,' said Cho.\n    In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry's insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.\n    Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again.\n    'I've been meaning to ask you for ages . . . did Cedric - did he - m - m - mention me at all before he died?'\n    This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.\n    'Well - no - ' he said quietly. There - there wasn't time for him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d'you . . . d'you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?'\n    His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last DA meeting before Christmas.\n    'Look,' he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, let's not talk about Cedric right now . . . let's talk about something else . . .'\n    But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.\n    'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'", "PPL": 0.6901209950447083, "PPL/lower": 0.7337392344638602, "PPL/zlib": 0.00020363558425633173, "Min-5%": 12.852059268483929, "Min-10%": 6.911200162899845, "Min-20%": 3.4528427520962683, "Min-30%": 2.3005166979328764, "Min-40%": 1.726916646206234, "Min-50%": 1.3808964818689962, "Min-60%": 1.1503837877248844}, {"text": "her eyes brimming with tears. \"M-m-master, p-p-please. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched.\n\u3000\u3000There was no pity in his gaze.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,\" he said slowly. \"I told her to remain in the tent.

It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch's feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"But she was frightened!\" Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. \"Your elf's scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can't blame her for wanting to get out of their way!\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,\" he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. \"I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master's reputation.\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, \"Well, I think I'll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody's got any objections. Amos, that wand's told us all it can - if Harry could have it back, please -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, you three,\" Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn't seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. \"Hermione!\" Mr. Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going to happen to Winky?\" said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"The way they were treating her!\" said Hermione furiously. \"Mr. Diggory, calling her 'elf' all the time. . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn't do it and he's still going to sack her! He didn't care how frightened she'd been, or how upset she was - it was like she wasn't even human!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, she's not,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione rounded on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"That doesn't mean she hasn't got feelings, Ron. It's disgusting the way -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I agree with you,\" said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, \"but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the others?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We lost them in the dark,\" said Ron. \"Dad, why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll explain everything back at the tent,\" said Mr. Weasley tensely.\n\u3000\u3000But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on in there?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who conjured it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur - it's not - Him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course it's not Him,\" said Mr. Weasley impatiently. \"We don't know who it was; it\n\u3000\u3000looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.\n\u3000\u3000Charlie's head was poking out of the boys' tent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dad, what's going on?\" he called through the dark. \"Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got them here,\" said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\n\u3000\u3000Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you get them, Dad?\" said Bill sharply. \"The person who conjured the Mark?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"We found Barry Crouch's elf holding Harry's wand, but we're none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together. \"Harry's wand?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Crouch's elf\" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\n\u3000\u3000With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\" he said. \"Running away when he'd expressly told her not to. . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry. . . how would that have looked, if she'd been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She didn't do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!\" Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy - better, indeed, than any of the others.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch's position can't afford a house-elf who's going to run amok with a wand!\" said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"She didn't run amok!\" shouted Hermione. \"She just picked it up off the ground!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?\" said Ron impatiently. \"It wasn't hurting anyone. . . . Why's it such a big deal?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean. . . it's still only a shape in the sky. .\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. . . .\" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone's worst fear. . . the very worst..\n\u3000\u3000There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Death Eaters?\" said Harry. \"", "PPL": 0.5856926441192627, "PPL/lower": 0.4647748411128383, "PPL/zlib": 0.00019634349450863651, "Min-5%": 10.450948474453945, "Min-10%": 5.842982612623303, "Min-20%": 2.930095874904803, "Min-30%": 1.9523899562000668, "Min-40%": 1.4656106727909708, "Min-50%": 1.171945219559673, "Min-60%": 0.9763106410870772}, {"text": "they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\"\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\"\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\n\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming....\"\nRon couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as\n210\nDumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\"\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\n\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\n\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\n211\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\n\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\nhim... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then...

Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home....

So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off\nter sleep --\"\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?\"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\n212\ncloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\"\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\"We'll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\"What are you three doing inside?\"\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\nHarry swallowed -- now what?\n\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.\n\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"\n\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\n\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --\n\"But this is important.\"\n\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.\n\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --\"\n213\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that.

Pretty firm with him. An' then he said summat abou\u2019 Snape makin' investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there's nothin' strange abou' that!\" Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. \"All the Heads o' Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business \u2014\"\n\"Yeah, but Dumbledore's not having rows with the rest of them, is he?\" said Harry.\n\"Look,\" Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. \"I know what yeh're like abou' Snape, Harry, an' I don' want yeh ter go readin' more inter this than there is.\"\n\"Look out,\" said Hermione tersely.\nThey turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.\n\"Oho!\" he wheezed. \"Out of bed so late, this'll mean detention!\"\n\"No it won', Filch,\" said Hagrid shortly. \"They're with me, aren\u2019 they?\"\n\"And what difference does that make?\" asked Filch obnoxiously. \n\"I'm a ruddy teacher, aren' I, yeh sneakin' Squib!\" said Hagrid, firing up at once.\nThere was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch's skinny ankles.\n\"Get goin,\" said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.\nHarry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid's and Filch's raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\n  \nWhen there's strife and when there's trouble \nCall on Peevsie, he'll make double! \n  \nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls' dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry's suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. ...\n\"There you are, Potter!\"\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\n\"I've been waiting for you to come back,\" said McLaggen, disregarding Harry\u2019s drawn wand. \"Must\u2019ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn't look like he'll be fit for next week's match.\"\nIt took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.\n\"Oh . . . right. . . Quidditch,\" he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. \"Yeah ... he might not make it.\"\n\"Well, then, I'll be playing Keeper, won't I?\" said McLaggen.\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, I suppose so. ...\"\nHe could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.\n\"Excellent,\" said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. \"So when's practice?\"\n\"What? Oh . . . there's one tomorrow evening.\"\n\"Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I've got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"Well, I'll hear them tomorrow, then. I'm pretty tired now ... see you . . .\"\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie's attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master's room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder's Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary.

In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly.\"\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...\n\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\"Do you think it's a ghost?\"\n223\n\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\"\n\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\n\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run.\"\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\"Now what?\" said Ron.\n\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\n\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\"\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door.\n\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\n224\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\nhand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\nhis hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\n\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n225\n\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\"\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\"\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\"\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\"\n\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\"\n\"What about you?\"\n\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes... look...\"\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n226\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me think...\"\nThe white queen", "PPL": 0.6083319187164307, "PPL/lower": 0.518819419140325, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001808358854686179, "Min-5%": 11.623405150338716, "Min-10%": 6.094091167636946, "Min-20%": 3.0439001490014164, "Min-30%": 2.0279495868800494, "Min-40%": 1.5222758026460044, "Min-50%": 1.2172467152965367, "Min-60%": 1.0140486292273974}, {"text": "him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.

Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked\nas if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's\nabout to fall off.

On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\n190\ninto a sweat.\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\nHarry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\"\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle.\"\nWhen they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all.\"\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\n191\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\"\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\nshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"\n\"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!\"\n\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\" \"Don't,\" Harry advised her.\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out\n192\nof the darkness.\nCharlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\nAt last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST Things couldn't have been worse.\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\nHad Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n193\n\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --\"\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\"I would never have believed it of any of you.

The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn't enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don't go wasting the rest of that potion! You'll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ...\" She dropped her voice to a whisper. \n\"Couldn't we make some more?\" Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. \"It'd be great to have a stock of it. ... Have a look in the book... \" \nHarry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis. \n\"Blimey, its seriously complicated,\" he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. \"And it takes six months.,. You've got to let it stew. ...\" \n\"Typical,\" said Ron. \nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned \"For Enemies,\" that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. \nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. \nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. \nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch. \nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . . \nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around \u2014 but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. \nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \"tweaking the circumstances\"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else. \nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. \nThe run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis. \nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless. \nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle. \nHarry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open. \nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side", "PPL": 7.102093696594238, "PPL/lower": 1.0561086223754204, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019009886768185864, "Min-5%": 35.2117125193278, "Min-10%": 30.39372486226699, "Min-20%": 24.402833460595613, "Min-30%": 20.084551419807955, "Min-40%": 16.72143170419707, "Min-50%": 14.0131388437713, "Min-60%": 11.828223894990325}, {"text": "looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky.

He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment . . . he had got so close that time.\n    Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening.\n*\nHarry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised Occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse.\n    He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class.\n    Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape's office after dinner. Halfway across the Entrance Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.\n    'Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood. Gryffindor's was now almost empty. 'Are you OK? Umbridge hasn't been asking you about the DA, has she?'\n    'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly. 'No, it was only . . . well, I just wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell . .'\n    'Yeah, well,' said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully; it was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.\n    'She's a lovely person really,' said Cho. 'She just made a mistake -\n    Harry looked at her incredulously.\n    'A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including you!'\n    'Well . . . we all got away, didn't we?' said Cho pleadingly. 'You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it's really difficult for her - '\n    'Ron's dad works for the Ministry too!' Harry said furiously. 'And in case you hadn't noticed, he hasn't got sneak written across his face - '\n    That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Cho fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list - '\n    'I think it was a brilliant idea,' said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.\n    'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea - '\n    'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.\n    'I wasn't going to!' she shouted.\n    'Yeah . . . well . . . good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cope with at the moment.'\n    'Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off.\n    Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.\n    'You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.\n    Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore's Pensieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry.\n    'So,' he said. 'Have you been practising?'\n    'Yes,' Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk.\n    'Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?' said Snape smoothly. 'Wand out, Potter.'\n    Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them. His heart was pumping last with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.\n    'On the count of three then,' said Snape lazily. 'One - two - '\n    Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.\n    'Professor Snape, sir - oh - sorry - '\n    Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.\n    'It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand. 'Potter is here for a little remedial Potions.'\n    Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.\n    'I didn't know,' he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy - or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.\n    'Well, Draco, what is it?' asked Snape.\n    'It's Professor Umbridge, sir - she needs your help,' said Malfoy.\n    They've found Montague, sir, he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.'\n    'How did he get in there?' demanded Snape.\n    'I don't know, sir, he's a bit confused.'\n    'Very well, very well. Potter,' said Snape, 'we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.'\n    He turned and swept from his office.

He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....\nHow very wrong he was.\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\nAlbus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down\n6\non the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\n\"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\n\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A\nfine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he\n7\nreally has gone, Dumbledore?\"\n\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\"\n\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\nby his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so\nconfusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\n\"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"\n\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\n\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.

HERMIONE!' yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. 'WE DID IT! WE WON!'\n    They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of 'Weasley is our King' died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.\n    'We'll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?' said Harry 'Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily. 'I'm not in any hurry.' They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE -\nOWLs\nRon's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\n    They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\n    'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his right, I mean - and - well - you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest\n    to them - a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepulis - had heard him. 'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later - What?' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. 'Why are you grinning?'\n    'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 'I'm just glad we won, that's all.'\n    'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'\n    'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly.\n    'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though . . .' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?'\n    'Er - ' said Harry\n    'Well, actually . . . no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. 'As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal.'\n    Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 'You didn't watch?' he said faintly, looking from one to the other. 'You didn't see me make any of those saves?'\n    Well - no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him. 'But Ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to!'\n    'Yeah?' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 'How come?'\n    'It was Hagrid,' said Harry. 'He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. Anyway . . .\"\n    The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.\n    'He brought one back and hid it in the Forest?'\n    'Yep,' said Harry grimly.\n    'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 'No, he can't have.'\n    'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly. 'Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, 'as Hermy.'\n    Ron gave a nervous laugh.\n    'And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?'\n    Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry.\n    'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice.\n    'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. 'Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.'\n    'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly. 'I mean, come on . . . we've got exams and we're about that far - ' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching '- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates?'\n    'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice.\n    Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.\n    'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all.'\n*\nThe castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last.\n    Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OW", "PPL": 0.5859983563423157, "PPL/lower": 0.4812160034301875, "PPL/zlib": 0.00017079520732798476, "Min-5%": 10.829967127126807, "Min-10%": 5.857300048255745, "Min-20%": 2.930992823434552, "Min-30%": 1.9532608186975136, "Min-40%": 1.466336970620959, "Min-50%": 1.1725465530970414, "Min-60%": 0.9768175486942354}, {"text": "telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'\n    'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you!'\n    By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\n    Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\n    He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\n    'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\n    Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\n    'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\n    Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\n    He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\n    'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\n    'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\n    Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\n    'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\n    Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\n    'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\n    'Er - ' said Harry.\n    He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\n    'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\n    'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\n    'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \"Exceeds Expectations\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.'\n    At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\n    'You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?' she went on, talking a little louder than before.\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?'\n    'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply. 'I would also advise -'\n    Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\n    'I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \"Exceeds Expectations\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging \"Acceptable\" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. 'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \"Outstanding\" in their OWLs, so - '\n    Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\n    'May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\n    'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. 'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?'\n    'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\n    'I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?' said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\n    'Were you?' said Professor McGonagall haughtily. 'Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \"Acceptable\" and \"Exceeds Expectations\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?'\n    'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. 'I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note.'\n    'What, this thing?' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\n    'Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror - '\n    'Did you not understand my note, Minerva?' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\n    'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.\n    'Well, then, I am confused . . . I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that - '\n    'False hope?' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. 'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '\n    'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '\n    'I should have made my", "PPL": 0.7372827529907227, "PPL/lower": 0.7717378731381696, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002180664753004208, "Min-5%": 13.243413925170898, "Min-10%": 7.352994450751473, "Min-20%": 3.6881763116720707, "Min-30%": 2.4576452538795412, "Min-40%": 1.844916735008004, "Min-50%": 1.4752612273388712, "Min-60%": 1.228998217016327}, {"text": "ves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment: Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.\n    'And the best bit,' whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, 'is they can't contradict you, because they can't admit they've read the article!'\n    To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no issue of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster.\n    'Dad's reprinting!' she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. 'He can't believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!'\n    Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS' and 'EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE' in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like 'DUNG' and 'UMBRIDGE' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were s t-ting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.\n    The dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick. He rolled over on to his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once . . .\n    He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair.\n    Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by t'le candles, knelt a man in black robes.\n    'I have been badly advised, it seems,' said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger.\n    'Master, I crave your pardon,' croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling.\n    'I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.\n    He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.\n    'You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?' asked Harry.\n    'Yes, My Lord, yes . . . I used to work in the Department aftet - 'after all . . .\"\n    'Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.'\n    'Bode could never have taken it, Master . . . Bode would have known he could not . . . undoubtedly, that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse . . .\"\n    'Stand up, Rookwood,' whispered Harry.\n    The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry's face.\n    'You have done well to tell me this,' said Harry. 'Very well . . . I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems . . . but no matter . . . we begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude, Rookwood . . .'\n    'My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,' gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief.\n    'I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.'\n    'Of course, My Lord, of course . . . anything . . .'\n    'Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.'\n    Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door.\n    Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved towards it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness . . . a face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits ior pupils . . .\n    'NOOOOOOOOO!'\n    'What?' yelled a voice nearby.\n    Harry Hailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced he was about to see the white, skull-like lace looming at him out of the dark again, then very near to him Ron's voice spoke.\n    'Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here!'\n    Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. Ron\n    looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes.\n    'Has someone been attacked again?' asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet. 'Is it Dad? Is it that snake?'\n    'No - everyone's fine - ' gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire. 'Well . . . Avery isn't . . . he's in trouble . . . he gave him the wrong information . . . Voldemort's really angry . . .'\n    Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on to his bed, rubbing his scar.\n    'But Rookwood's going to help him now . . . he's on the right track again\n    'What are you talking about?' said Ron, sounding scared. 'D'you mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who?'\n    'I was You-Know-Who,' said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. 'He was with Rookwood, he's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwood's just told him Bode couldn't have done it.'\n    'Done what?'\n    'Remove something . . . he said Bode would have known he couldn't have done it . . .

'But - 'Harry, that's got to be - '\n    The weapon,' Harry finished the sentence for him. 'I know.'\n    The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter.\n    'Did you say,' murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, 'that you were You-Know-Who?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry quietly.\n    Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest.\n    'Harry,' he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, 'you've got to tell - '\n    'I haven't got to tell anyone,' said Harry shortly.

Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, tndestructble stuff --\n\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I thought he sounded a bit like you.\"\n\"Like me?\"\n\"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\"\nHarry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.\n\"Harry! Hey, Harry!\"\nHarry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.\n\"For you,\" panted Sloper. \"Listen, 1 heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?\"\n\"I'm not sure yet,\" said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \"I'll let you know.\" \n\"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -\"\n\"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.\nDear Harry,\nI would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.\nYours sincerely,\nAlbus Dumbledore\nP.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\n\"He enjoys Acid Pops?\" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed.\n\"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\" said Harry in a low voice. \"Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!\"\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's.\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\n\"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" \nBefore they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.\n\"Now then, now then, now then,\" said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \"Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies\nof Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\"\n\"Sir?\" said Harry, raising his hand.\n\"Harry, m'boy?\"\n\"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -\"\n\"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\"\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.\n\"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" \nHe indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.\nHermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her.\n\"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the, drinker to tell the truth,\" said Hermione.\n\"Very good, very good!\" said Slughorn happily. \"Now,\" he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \"this one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can - ?\"\nHermione's hand was fastest once more.\n\"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said.\nHarry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \n\"It's Amortentia!\"\n\"It is indeed.

When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.\n    Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\n    'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.'\n    'What are you doing here?' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?'\n    'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas.' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.'\n    Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed.\n    'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . .'\n    She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\n    'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\n    'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\n    'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's.'\n    They do, do they?' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\n    'Well, you have!' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us!'\n    'It's you lot who won't look at me!' said Harry angrily.\n    'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\n    'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away.\n    'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\n    'Yeah?' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it.'\n    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\n    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\n    'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'\n    Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round.\n    'I forgot,' he said.\n    'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.\n    Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then?'\n    'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?'\n    Harry racked his brains.\n    'No,' he said.\n    Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.'\n    Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\n    'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\n    'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.'\n    This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ?'\n    'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.'\n    'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.'\n    Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth.\n    I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\n    Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice.\n*\nHow could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\n    Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\n    'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\n    Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay!'\n    Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off.

The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do they think they're doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\" Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \"No respect...\"\n\u3000\u3000Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my brothers weren't bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\" said Percy at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh not at all, not at all!\" said Bagman. \"No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko's Joke Shop. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy didn't look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? Our department's quite satisfied -the hitch with the Goblet of Fire\" - he glanced at Harry - \"was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you think?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" Bagman said cheerfully, \"it's all been enormous fun.

Of course, it's not all attending balls\" - he laughed airily - \"oh no, I've had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we've been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling.

Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"... don't see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening!\" Karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. \"It's been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can't deny it _\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then flee,\" said Snapes voice curtly. \"Flee - I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!\" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. \"And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!\" as a boy went rushing after her. \"And what are you two doing?\" he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"We re walking,\" Ron told Snape shortly. \"Not against the law, is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Keep walking, then!\" Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's got Karkaroff all worried?\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?\"said Harry slowly.\n\u3000\u3000They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Momen' I saw yeh, I knew,\" he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron froze. This didn't sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you know, 'Agrid?\" said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option.\n\u3000\u3000Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out Hagrid's next words.\n\u3000\u3000\"I jus' knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I don't know what you mean, 'Agrid. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was my mother,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"She was one o' the las' ones in Britain.\n\u3000\u3000'Course, I can' remember her too well. . . she left, see.

And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the\n\u3000\u3000beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers, listening. ... He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen'. Tiny little bloke, my dad was.

And why was she with you?\" \n  \nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \n  \n\"Thanks a lot, Hermione,\" said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. \"Listen, I\u2019ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore. ...\" \n  \nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. \n  \n\"Enter,\" called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney. \n  \n\"Aha!\" she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. \n  \n\"So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!\" \n  \n\"My dear Sybill,\" said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, \"there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said \u2014\" \n  \n\"Very well,\" said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. \"If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. ... \n  \nPerhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ...\" \n  \nShe pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. \n  \n\"Please close the door and sit down, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired. \n  \nHarry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory. \n  \n\"Professor Trelawney still isn't happy Firenze is teaching, then?\" Harry asked. \n  \n\"No,\" said Dumbledore, \"Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \u2014 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \u2014 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\" \n  \nDumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, \"But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly \u2014 have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?\" \n  \n\"Ah,\" said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. \"Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me.\" There was a little silence. \n  \n\"I see,\" said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \"And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?\" \n  \n\"Well,\" Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. \"Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood \u2014\" \"And did that work?\" asked Dumbledore. \"Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned \u2014\" \"\u2014 which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.\" \n  \nA hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry\u2019s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. \n  \n\"Sir,\" he said, a little desperately, \"it isn't that I wasn't bothered or anything, I've just had other \u2014 other things . . .\" \n  \n", "PPL": 6.7216715812683105, "PPL/lower": 1.0461401394990368, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019398763582303927, "Min-5%": 35.83310332952761, "Min-10%": 30.28359286925372, "Min-20%": 23.82691432794324, "Min-30%": 19.303426075447653, "Min-40%": 15.977817498092838, "Min-50%": 13.335076966476814, "Min-60%": 11.198791420481589}, {"text": "open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.\n    'Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. 'I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now.'\n    The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\n    First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.\n    'A couple of people?' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people?'\n    'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?'\n    The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\n    'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have . . . twenty-five Butterbeers, please?'\n    The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\n    'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these . . .'\n    Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\n    'What have you been telling people?' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting?'\n    'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'\n    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\n    Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\n    In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\n    'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi.'\n    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\n    'Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'\n    She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, 'And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells - '\n    'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely.\n    'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once. 'But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because . . . because . . .' she took a great breath and finished, 'because Lord Voldemort is back.'\n    The reaction was immediate and predictable. Clio's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\n    Well . . . that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione. 'If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to -\n    'Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?' said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\n    'Well, Dumbledore believes it - ' Hermione began.\n    'You mean, Dumbledore believes him,' said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\n    'Who are you?' said Ron, rather rudely.\n    'Zacharias Smith,' said the boy, 'and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.'\n    'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '\n    'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry.\n    It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand.\n    'What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?' he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face. 'I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.'\n    The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.\n    Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know - '\n    'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho. 'I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.'\n    He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\n    'So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again.

They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?\n    'Is it those mad horse things?' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. 'Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'How many?'\n    'Just two.'\n    'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\n    'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling.\n    'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting.\n    'Don't be stupid, we can't all go!' said Harry angrily. 'Look, you three - ' he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, 'you're not involved in this, you're not - '\n    They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.\n    'OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, 'but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able - '\n    'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.\n    'What makes you think that?'\n    'Because, in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,' she said coolly, 'and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That's probably why these two turned up in the first place.'\n    Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood.\n    'OK, then,' he said, a bright idea occurring, 'Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more Thestrals - '\n    'I'm not staying behind!' said Hermione furiously.\n    There's no need,' said Luna, smiling. 'Look, here come more now . . . you two must really smell . . .'\n    Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.\n    'All right,' he said angrily, 'pick one and get on, then.'\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR -\nThe Department\nOf Mysteries\nHarry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.\n    He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring.\n    'What?' he said.\n    'How're we supposed to get on?' said Ron faintly. 'When we can't see the things?'\n    'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny. 'Come here . . .'\n    She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed.\n    This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horses neck. 'Mad . . . if I could just see it - '\n    'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly. 'We all ready, then?'\n    They all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.\n    'OK . . .'\n    He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed.\n    'Ministry of Magic, visitors' entrance, London, then,' he said uncertainly. 'Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .'\n    For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset.\n    Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream.\n    They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills . . .\n    This is bizarre!' Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support.\n    Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or how very fast they were travelling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sirius be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr Weasley was attacked.\n    On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry's face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the Thestral's sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip . . . he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards.\n    If they were too late . . .\n    He's still alive, he's still fighting, I can feel it . . .\n    If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . .\n    I'd know . . .\n    Harry's stomach gave a jolt; the Thestral's head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last . . . he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body . . . presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had.\n    And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale", "PPL": 0.8840816617012024, "PPL/lower": 0.7193252447148194, "PPL/zlib": 0.00025603291679733635, "Min-5%": 14.49942204064014, "Min-10%": 8.737112031847824, "Min-20%": 4.421198102618251, "Min-30%": 2.946633900446341, "Min-40%": 2.212140640017746, "Min-50%": 1.7689648594994363, "Min-60%": 1.4736932133889065}, {"text": ".\n\"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?

Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.\n\"Hagrid,\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \"HAGRID?\"\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\n\"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\"\nHagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\n\"I'm all right,\" panted Harry. \"Are you?\" \"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\"\nHagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\n\"We should put out your house,\" said Harry, \"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\"\n\"Knew it was summat like that,\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \"Aguamenti!\"\nA jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \"Aguamenti\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\n\"S'not too bad,\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\"\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\n\"Hagrid ...\"\n\"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\"\n\"Hagrid . . .\"\n\"But what happened, Harry?

What're yeh on abou', Harry?\"\n\"Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\"\nHagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\n\"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\"\n\"He's dead.

Wha's made yeh say tha'?\"\n\"I saw it happen.\" , ,..\n\"Yeh couldn' have.\"\n\"I saw it, Hagrid.\"\nHagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...\n\"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\" Hagrid said confidently. \"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\"\nHarry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .\nThe oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought\nDumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\n\"What're they all lookin' at?\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\"\nHagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .\nHe and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.\nHarry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.\nDumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleep", "PPL": 7.909182071685791, "PPL/lower": 0.997740238941445, "PPL/zlib": 0.0023751297512569942, "Min-5%": 38.89335080689075, "Min-10%": 33.26831974702723, "Min-20%": 26.974458158161937, "Min-30%": 22.53094665545982, "Min-40%": 18.8172507863173, "Min-50%": 15.689352627956506, "Min-60%": 13.177121133801409}, {"text": "ue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.\n\u3000\u3000There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers.\n\u3000\u3000They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you need three hours?\" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \"Who're you going with?\" he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.\n\u3000\u3000There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lairy fights, that's the one!\" she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was\n\u3000\u3000just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\" muttered Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Animal magnetism,\" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.\n\u3000\u3000The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling.\n\u3000\u3000\"You - er - look nice,\" he said awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall,\" she added to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron, looking around. \"Where's Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati shrugged. \"Shall we go down then, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise.\n\u3000\u3000She didn't look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. \"Oh no ...\"\n\u3000\u3000He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Hermione?\" he said again.\n\u3000\u3000A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.\n\u3000\u3000The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn't know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.\n\u3000\u3000Then Professor McGonagall's voice called, \"Champions over here, please!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, \"See you in a minute\" to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.\n\u3000\u3000It was Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow - or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty\n\u3000\u3000or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling - rather nervously, it was true - but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn't understand how he hadn't spotted it before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Harry!\" she said. \"Hi, Parvati!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at", "PPL": 0.2435246855020523, "PPL/lower": 0.3532274973499289, "PPL/zlib": 6.918314929035577e-05, "Min-5%": 4.761737558771582, "Min-10%": 2.4375640894286335, "Min-20%": 1.2186643577833753, "Min-30%": 0.8121149298404677, "Min-40%": 0.608917450935844, "Min-50%": 0.48703790900982113, "Min-60%": 0.40613621779761727}, {"text": "ck,\n    Ron's body turned into Bill's, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide open and empty.

Lupin looked from Mrs Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling out his own wand, he said, very firmly and clearly:\n    'Riddikulus!'\n    Harry's body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.\n    'Oh - oh - oh!' gulped Mrs Weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands.\n    'Molly' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her.

He had a funny feeling Moody's magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.\n    'D - d - don't tell Arthur,' Mrs Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. 'I d - d - don't want him to know . . . being silly . . .'\n    Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.\n    'Harry, I'm so sorry. What must you think of me?' she said shakily. 'Not even able to get rid of a Boggart . . .'\n    'Don't be stupid,' said Harry, trying to smile.\n    'I'm just s - s - so worried,' she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again.

You weren't in the Order then, you don't understand. Last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one . . .'\n    Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents' beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.\n    'Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly. 'He'll come round. It's only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry's going to be begging us to forgive them. And I'm not sure I'll be accepting their apology,' he added bitterly.\n    'And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,' said Lupin, smiling slightly, 'what do you think we'd do, let them starve?'\n    Mrs Weasley smiled tremulously.\n    'Being silly,' she muttered again, mopping her eyes.\n    But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the Boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs Weasley's family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.\n    Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.\n    'Cut it out,' he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded.\n    'First sign of madness, talking to your own head,' said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall.\n    Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefects badge.\n- CHAPTER TEN -\nLuna Lovegood\nHarry had a troubled nights sleep. His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs Weasley sobbed over Kreacher's dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking clown a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.\n    '. . . better hurry up, Mums going ballistic, she says we're going to miss the train . . .' \n    There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs Black and Mrs Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.\n    ' - COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS - '\n    ' - FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS - '\n    Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered, just as Harry was putting on his trainers. Hedwig was swaying or her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.\n    'Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back.' The owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage. Are you ready yet?'\n    'Nearly. Is Ginny all right?' Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.\n    'Mrs Weasley's patched her up,' said Hermione. 'But now Mad-Eye's complaining that we can't leave unless Sturgis Podmore's here, otherwise the guard will be one short.'\n    'Guard?' said Harry. 'We have to go to King's Cross with a guard?'\n    'You have to go to King's Cross with a guard,' Hermione corrected him.\n    'Why?' said Harry irritably. 'I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he's going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in.'\n    'I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says,' said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, 'but if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train . . .'\n    'WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!'", "PPL": 0.7916947603225708, "PPL/lower": 0.612561424778144, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002519715978111301, "Min-5%": 12.783303924635344, "Min-10%": 7.695000849225941, "Min-20%": 3.9581605469976484, "Min-30%": 2.6399733643172647, "Min-40%": 1.9795732793892291, "Min-50%": 1.5833511846864212, "Min-60%": 1.3203413058934896}, {"text": "year, he hired Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody's well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\n\u3000\u3000Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.\n\u3000\u3000An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures.\n\u3000\u3000While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \"very frightening.\"\n\u3000\u3000'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\" says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. \"We all hate Hagrid, but we're just too scared to say anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" highly dangerous crosses between manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was just having some fun,\" he says, before hastily changing the subject.\n\u3000\u3000As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\u3000\u3000Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\n\u3000\u3000While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors\n\u3000\u3000working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Frid-wulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\n\u3000\u3000In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\n\u3000\u3000Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did she find out?\" he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000But that wasn't what was bothering Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, 'we all hate Hagrid'?\" Harry spat at Malfoy. \"What's this rubbish about him\" - he pointed at Crabbe - \"getting a bad bite off a flobberworm? They haven't even got teeth!\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career,\" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. \"Half-giant. . . and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. ... They'll be worried he'll eat their kids, ha, ha. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you paying attention over there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Grubbly-Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope she stays, that woman!\" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. \"That's more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . .\n\u3000\u3000.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about Hagrid?\" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about him?\" said Parvati in a hard voice. \"He can still be gamekeeper, can't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same.\n\u3000\u3000She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a really good lesson,\" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \"I didn't know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at this!\" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione's nose.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron's.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don't think Hagrid told her?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \"He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\" said Hermione quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd have seen her in the garden!\" said Ron. \"Anyway, she's not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \"Sort of thing she'd do, isn't it, hide in bushes listening to people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like you and Ron did, you mean,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't trying to hear him!\" said Ron indignantly. \"We didn't have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got to go and see him,\" said Harry. \"This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?\" he shot at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - well, I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\" Hermione\n\u3000\u3000added hastily, quailing under Harry's furious stare.\n\u3000\u3000So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid's cabin. They knocked, and Fang's booming barks answered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry shouted, pounding on the door", "PPL": 0.21806302666664124, "PPL/lower": 0.2769003713888098, "PPL/zlib": 6.447753597476086e-05, "Min-5%": 4.320869125060591, "Min-10%": 2.181334719618819, "Min-20%": 1.090404850021483, "Min-30%": 0.7267620851033016, "Min-40%": 0.5456281081155827, "Min-50%": 0.43632151567785427, "Min-60%": 0.3634927475933961}, {"text": "voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back.

The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\n13\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\"\nHarry groaned.\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing...\"\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes\nof Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He\nwore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\n14\nPetunia was how he had gotten it.\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\"\nDon't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig.\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult\nas there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\"\n\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"\n\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''\n15\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty ... thirty...\"\n\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair.\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\"Bad news", "PPL": 0.42019498348236084, "PPL/lower": 0.5097973083155216, "PPL/zlib": 0.00012197241900794218, "Min-5%": 7.529694912480373, "Min-10%": 4.180212053890322, "Min-20%": 2.101722945179107, "Min-30%": 1.4006391392903386, "Min-40%": 1.0514582765107126, "Min-50%": 0.8407874727303367, "Min-60%": 0.7004362681262386}, {"text": ",' said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, 'How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?'\n    'He feels angry, of course,' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. 'Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him.'\n    'So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back?' said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. 'You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore'5 been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?'\n    'I wasn't the sole witness,' snarled Harry. There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?'\n    'I'd love them,' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. 'A great bold headline: \"Potter Accuses . . .\" A sub-heading, \"Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us\". And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you, \"Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who's attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters . . .\" '\n    The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died.\n    'But of course,' she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, 'Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she?'\n    'As a matter of fact,' said Hermione sweetly, 'that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.'\n    Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang 'Weasley is our King' dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.\n    'You want me to report what he says about He Who Must Not Be Named?' Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    'Yes, I do,' said Hermione. 'The true story. All the facts. Exactly a; Harry reports them. He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh, get a grip on yourself,' she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemort's name, Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself.\n    Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, The Prophet wouldn't print it. In case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he's delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle - '\n    'We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles!' said Hermione angrily. 'We've had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!'\n    There's no market for a story like that,' said Rita coldly.\n    'You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,' said Hermione irritably.\n    Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, 'All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It's against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don't want to believe You-Know-Who's back.'\n    'So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?' said Hermione scathingly.\n    Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,\n    The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly\n    'My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eye;. 'He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn't care about making money.'\n    Rita looked disparagingly at Luna.\n    'I'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?' she said. 'Probably, Twenty-five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale?'\n    'No,' said Luna, dipping her onion back into her Gillywater, 'he's the editor of The Quibbler.'\n    Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm.\n    ' \"Important stories he thinks the public needs to know\", eh?' she said witheringly. 'I could manure my garden with the contends of that rag.'\n    'Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn't it?' said Hermione pleasantly. 'Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview. That's who'll be publishing it.'\n    Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter.\n    'The Quibbler!' she said, cackling. 'You think people will take him seriously if he's published in The Quibbler!'\n    'Some people won't,' said Hermione in a level voice. 'But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened, and if there's an alternative story available, even if it is published in a - ' she glanced sideways at Luna, 'in a - well, an unusual magazine - I think they might be rather keen to read it.'\n    Rita didn't say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.\n    'All right, let's say for a moment I'll do it,' she said abruptly. 'What kind of fee am I going to get?'\n    'I don't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,' said Luna dreamily. They do it because it's an honour and, of course, to see their names in print.'\n    Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione.\n    'I'm supposed to do this for free?'\n    'Well, yes,' said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. 'Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban.'\n    Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione's drink and thrust it up her nose.\n    'I don't suppose I've got any choice, have I?' said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.\n    'Daddy will be pleased,' said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw.\n    'OK, Harry?' said Hermione, turning to him. 'Ready to tell the public the truth?'\n    'I suppose,' said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.\n    'Fire away, then, Rita,' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass.\n- CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX -\nSeen and Unforseen\nLuna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, ' - and of course, that", "PPL": 0.9026951193809509, "PPL/lower": 0.5434721026445151, "PPL/zlib": 0.00027429204478302975, "Min-5%": 15.674409599865184, "Min-10%": 8.942659626696624, "Min-20%": 4.516331643517377, "Min-30%": 3.0102713370501557, "Min-40%": 2.2571289528071596, "Min-50%": 1.805351970844498, "Min-60%": 1.505463438036343}, {"text": "- when - you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't talking.\" Harry finished the sentence for him. \"Yeah, but blackmail...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's this joke shop idea they've got,\" said Ron. \"I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They've only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think about their future, and Dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but. . . they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't they?\" said Ron, looking skeptical. \"I dunno . . . they don't exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but this is the law\" said Hermione, looking scared. \"This isn't some silly school rule. . . . They'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . . maybe you'd\n\u3000\u3000better tell Percy. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you mad?\" said Ron. \"Tell Percy? He'd probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\" He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had departed, then said, \"Come on, let's get some breakfast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody?\" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep. Let's give it till break.\"\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody?\" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you find him?\" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you use the map?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere on there.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So he did Disapparate?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You're another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way. Granger.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he wasn't invisible,\" said Harry. \"The map shows invisible people. He must've left the grounds, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But under his own steam?\" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, someone could've - could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn't they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Ron, \"d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he's not here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \"Now, Dumbledore's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry. \"Oh yeah . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night.\n\u3000\u3000\"Should be right up your street, this one,\" said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \"From what Dumbledore's said, you've managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We helped,\" Ron said quickly. \"Me and Hermione helped.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, help him practice for this one, and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't win,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Moody. \"In the meantime .. . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\" He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window.\n\u3000\u3000The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You two,\" counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \"you stick close to Potter, all right? I'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.\"\n\u3000\u3000Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, \"Ha!\n\u3000\u3000She hasn't got wind of Crouch!\" then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.\n\u3000\u3000Harry - what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could have been killed.\n\u3000\u3000Your name didn't get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone's trying to attack you, they're on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn't go amiss either. There's nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray out-of-bounds again.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius \"Who's he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?\" said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius's letter and put it inside his robes. \"After all the stuff he did at school!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's worried about you!\" said Hermione sharply. \"Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one's tried to attack me all year,\" said Harry. \"No one's done anything to me at all-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\" said Hermione. \"And they must've done that for a reason.", "PPL": 0.5164201855659485, "PPL/lower": 0.4707979613754195, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001602296573273188, "Min-5%": 10.117202243384193, "Min-10%": 5.175333235595448, "Min-20%": 2.583928771216814, "Min-30%": 1.7215280057003506, "Min-40%": 1.2922774319034818, "Min-50%": 1.0333356986472413, "Min-60%": 0.8608381593651857}, {"text": "Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody's office.\n    These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.\n    'And just look at these books!' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. 'A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .' She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. 'Harry, this is wonderful, there's everything we need here!'\n    And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read.\n    There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived.\n    'Whoa,' said Dean, staring around, impressed. 'What is this place?'\n    Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.\n    'Well,' said Harry, slightly nervously. This is the place we've found for practice sessions, and you've - er - obviously found it OK.'\n    'It's fantastic!' said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement.\n    'It's bizarre,' said Fred, frowning around at it. 'We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then.'\n    'Hey, Harry, what's this stuff?' asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.\n    'Dark detectors,' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. 'Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don't want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled\n    He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognisable. He turned his back on it.\n    'Well, I've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er - ' He noticed a raised hand. 'What, Hermione?'\n    'I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione.\n    'Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad.\n    Harry's stomach did yet another back-flip.\n    'Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed. 'It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So - 'everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?'\n    Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly.\n    'Er - right, thanks,' said Harry, who could feel his face burning. 'And - what, Hermione?'\n    'I also think we ought to have a name,' she said brightly, her hand still in the air. 'It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?'\n    'Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?' said Angelina hopefully.\n    'Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group?' suggested Fred.\n    'I was thinking,' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, 'more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.'\n    The Defence Association?' said Cho. 'The DA for short, so nobody knows what we're talking about?'\n    'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny. 'Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army, because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it?'\n    There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this.\n    'All in favour of the DA?' said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. That's a majority - motion passed!'\n    She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters:\nDUMBLEDORE'S ARMY\n'Right,' said Harry, when she had sat down again, 'shall we get practising then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it's pretty basic but I've found it really useful - '\n    'Oh, please,' said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. 'I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?'\n    'I've used it against him,' said Harry quietly. 'It saved my life in June.'\n    Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.\n    'But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,' Harry said.\n    Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.\n    'OK,' said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, 'I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise.'\n    It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.\n    You can practise with me,' Harry told him. 'Right - on the count of three, then - one, two, three - '\n    The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus. Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them.\n    'Expelliarmus! said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, tell his wand fly out of his hand.\n    'I DID IT!' said Neville gleefully. 'I've never done it before - I DID IT!'\n    'Good one!' said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. 'Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?'\n    Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.\n    'Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. 'Couldn't resist.'\n    Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.\n    'OK, stop!' Harry shouted. 'Stop.' STOP!'\n    I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands.\n    That wasn't bad,' said Harry,", "PPL": 0.7656685709953308, "PPL/lower": 0.5866707349755271, "PPL/zlib": 0.00021598549252336554, "Min-5%": 13.29607374527875, "Min-10%": 7.5683131141989834, "Min-20%": 3.828748840312667, "Min-30%": 2.552000692959098, "Min-40%": 1.9158662589773403, "Min-50%": 1.532037178955618, "Min-60%": 1.276309434349412}, {"text": "sounded as though you were hurt...' \n'I - well,' said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. 'I wished to - ah - deposit certain \u2013 um - personal items in the Room ...' And she muttered something about 'nasty accusations'. \n'Right,' said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. 'But you couldn't get in and hide them?' \nHe found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. \n'Oh, I got in all right,' said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. 'But there was somebody already in there.' \n'Somebody in -? Who?' demanded Harry. 'Who was in there?' \n' ? have no idea,' said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry's voice. 'I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.' \n'A voice? Saying what?' \n'I don't know that it was saying anything,' said Professor Trelawney. 'It was ... whooping.' \n'Whooping?' \n'Gleefully,' she said, nodding. \nHarry stared at her. \n'Was it male or female?' \n' ? would hazard a guess at male,' said Professor Trelawney. \n'And it sounded happy?' \n'Very happy,' said Professor Trelawney sniffily. \n'As though it was celebrating?' \n'Most definitely.' \n'And then -?' \n'And then I called out, \"Who's there?\"' \n'You couldn't have found out who it was without asking?' Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. \n\u2018The Inner Eye,' said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.' \n'Right,' said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney's Inner Eye all too often before. 'And did the voice say who was there?' \n'No, it did not,' she said. 'Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!' \n'And you didn't see that coming?' said Harry, unable to help himself. \n'No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -' She stopped and glared at him suspiciously. \n'I think you'd better tell Professor Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'He ought to know Malfoy's celebrating - I mean, that some-one threw you out of the Room.' \nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty. \nThe Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,' she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -' \nHer bony hand closed suddenly around Harry's wrist. \n'Again and again, no matter how I lay them out -' \nAnd she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. \n'- the lightning-struck tower,' she whispered. 'Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time ...' \n'Right,' said Harry again. 'Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room ...' \n'You think so?' Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. \n'I'm going to see him right now,' said Harry. 'I've got a meeting with him. We could go together.' \n'Oh, well, in that case,' said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche. \n'I miss having you in my classes, Harry,' she said soulfully, as they set off together. 'You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object...' \nHarry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney's continual predictions of doom. \n'I am afraid,' she went on, 'that the nag - I'm sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibra-tions of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!' \nHer voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind. \n'Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother's gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?' \nHarry mumbled something indistinct. \n'I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,' went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. 'He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog's Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me ... I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed towards Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...' \nAnd now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort. \n'... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!' \n'What?' \n'Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I'm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more dis-posed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?' \nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just real-ised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other. \n'Harry?' she repeated uncertainly. \nPerhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating every-thing except the information that had been kept from him for so long ... \nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunt-ing after Lily and James and their son ... \nNothing else mattered to Harry just now. \n'Harry?' said Professor Trelawney again. 'Harry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?' \n'You stay here,' said Harry through numb lips. \n'But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-' \n'You stay here!' Harry repeated angrily. \nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore's door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered 'Enter' after Harry had already flung himself into the room. \nFawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold", "PPL": 7.198209285736084, "PPL/lower": 0.9964445930658773, "PPL/zlib": 0.0021423241921833583, "Min-5%": 36.3717882679958, "Min-10%": 31.269877686220056, "Min-20%": 25.084217736073985, "Min-30%": 20.52913137833536, "Min-40%": 17.014606324851076, "Min-50%": 14.23084827916713, "Min-60%": 11.984637118062968}, {"text": "meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. 'He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.'\n    Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\n    'Any questions, Potter?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\n    'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '\n    'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.'\n    '- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another - '\n    'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.'\n    'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.\n    'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.\n    'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.\n    Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\n    'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\n    Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\n    'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\n    The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\n    There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\n    'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\n    'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\n    Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\n    Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\n    'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already . . .'\n    Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking . . .\n    He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him . . . there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve . . . nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach . . . and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\n    But the fact remained that if he was caught . . .\n    'Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from\n    Umbridge.

Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\n    He did not answer; he did not know what to do.\n    Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, 'Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.'\n    Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - '\n    Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.\n    'Harry - please!' Hermione pleaded weakly.\n    But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.\n    Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door.\n    He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.\n    Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.\n    Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\n    He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames.\n    'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!' Harry said loudly and clearly\n    It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around ir. the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretchec over the country.

Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\nHarry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\nThey weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\n128\nThey fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\n\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on.\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\n\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.\"\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\nI hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\n129\nback into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\nCHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\nIndeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\n\"Or both,\" said Harry.\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\nwas about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had\nhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n130\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.\nProfessor McGonagall\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\"\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they\nfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time,\nPotter, first years aren't allowed them.\"\nRon couldn't resist it.\n\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus.\"\n\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\n131\n\"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\n\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.

Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur!\" she called up the staircase. \"Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers - \"I've got a quill here somewhere!\" - and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to -Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\n\u3000\u3000Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d'you-call-'ems - please-men. Arthur, you've got to get over there --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here!\" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\" said Mr. Diggory's head. \"I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does Mad-Eye say happened?\" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head rolled its eyes. \"Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What did the dustbins do?\" asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,\" said Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Diggory. \"Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about the intruder?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,\" said Mr. Diggory's head, rolling its eyes again. \"Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there's a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye, he's had it -- think of his record -- we've got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department -- what are exploding dustbins worth?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Might be a caution,\" said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad-Eye didn't use his wand? He didn't actually attack anyone?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"but they'll have a job proving it, there aren't any casualties.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, I'm off,\" Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry about this, Molly,\" it said, more calmly, \"bothering you so early and everything...but Arthur's the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye's supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last night. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Never mind, Amos,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Sure you won't have a bit of toast or anything before you go?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh go on, then,\" said Mr. Diggory.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory's mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fanks,\" he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd better hurry - you have a good term, boys, said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate. \"Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King's Cross?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I will,\" she said. \"You just look after Mad-Eye, we'll be fine.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did someone say Mad-Eye?\" Bill asked. \"What's he been up to now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He says someone tried to break into his house last night,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad-Eye Moody?\" said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast. \"Isn't he that nutter -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,\" said Mrs. Weasley sternly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn't he?\" said Fred quietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. \"Birds of a feather. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody was a great wizard in his time,\" said Bill.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's an old friend of Dumbledore's, isn't he?\" said Charlie.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's not what you'd call normal, though, is he?\" said Fred. \"I mean, I know he's a genius and everything.. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who", "PPL": 0.2932024300098419, "PPL/lower": 0.31130121670292943, "PPL/zlib": 9.7344764279496e-05, "Min-5%": 5.655116337771509, "Min-10%": 2.9322618990040876, "Min-20%": 1.4667281039758793, "Min-30%": 0.9773464322562067, "Min-40%": 0.7336862085931722, "Min-50%": 0.5866821331504356, "Min-60%": 0.4887481907998104}, {"text": "sent me all these, you know,' he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. 'Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?'\n    Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, 'So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back?'\n    'Yes,' said Neville, 'everything's settled right back to normal.'\n    'I s'pose Filch is happy, is he?' asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.\n    'Not at all,' said Ginny. 'He's really, really miserable, actually . . .' She lowered her voice to a whisper. 'He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts . . .'\n    All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n    'Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione.\n    'Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.\n    'Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.\n    'Anything wrong, Professor?' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.\n    'No . . . no . . .' said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. 'No, I must have been dreaming . . .'\n    Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n    'Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, 'who's Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?'\n    'He's got to,' said Harry, 'the other centaurs won't take him back, will they?'\n    'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny.\n    'Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. 'Mind you, the whole subject's useless if you ask me, Firenze isn't a lot better . . .'\n    'How can you say that?' Hermione demanded. 'After we've just found out that there are real prophecies?'\n    Harry's heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way . . .\n    'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.\n    'Yeah, it is,' said Ron. 'Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going?' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.\n    'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry. 'You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are.'\n    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. 'Wish we could come.'\n    'Say hello to him for us!' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. 'And ask him what's happening about . . . about his little friend!'\n    Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.\n    The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.\n    He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned . . .\n    Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors.\n    Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, 'You're dead, Potter.'\n    Harry raised his eyebrows.\n    'Funny' he said, 'you'd think I'd have stopped walking around\n    Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.\n    'You're going to pay,' said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. 'I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to my father . . .'\n    'Well, I'm terrified now,' said Harry sarcastically. 'I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three - what's the matter?' he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. 'He's a mate of your dad, isn't he? Not scared of him, are you?'\n    'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. 'You wait. I'll have you. You can't land my father in prison - '\n    'I thought I just had,' said Harry.\n    The Dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly. 'Dad and the others'll be out in no time . . .'\n    'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry. 'Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now - '\n    Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.\n    'Potter!'\n    The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy . . . whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . .  . never . . .\n    'What are you doing, Potter?' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.\n    'I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely.\n    Snape stared at him.\n    'Put that wand away at once,' he said curtly. Ten points from Gryff - '\n    Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.\n    'Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to - '\n    'Add some more?'\n    Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone, steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.\n    'Professor McGonagall!' said Snape, striding forwards. 'Out of St Mungo's, I see!'\n    'Yes, Professor Snape,' said Professor McGonagall. shru", "PPL": 1.092955470085144, "PPL/lower": 0.6212004858824954, "PPL/zlib": 0.0003336249908684811, "Min-5%": 15.96249683230531, "Min-10%": 10.42089152102377, "Min-20%": 5.461201016196849, "Min-30%": 3.642495557785653, "Min-40%": 2.7347223107126077, "Min-50%": 2.186889741857894, "Min-60%": 1.821866310624847}, {"text": "ing that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning . . .\n    'It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. 'But it won't be long now\n    'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.\n    Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight.\n    'What's - er - going on with you and her, anyway?' Ron asked quietly.\n    'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully.\n    'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively.\n    Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days . . . the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.\n    'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully. 'I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.'\n    'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'Who's she with now, anyway?' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.\n    'Michael Corner,' she said.\n    'Michael - but - ' said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. 'But you were going out with him!'\n    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely. 'He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.\n    'Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle. 'Good for you. Just choose someone - better - next time.\n    He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.\n    'Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?' asked Ginny vaguely.\n    'WHAT?' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.\n    As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.\n    When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all.\n    There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.\n    'Ron, Ginny!' called Mrs Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly. 'Oh, and Harry dear - how are you?'\n    'Fine,' lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes.\n    'What are they supposed to be?' he asked, pointing at the jackets.\n    'Finest dragonskin, little bro',' said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. 'Business is booming and we thought we'd treat ourselves.'\n    'Hello, Harry,' said Lupin, as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.\n    'Hi,' said Harry. 'I didn't expect . . . what are you all doing here?'\n    'Well,' said Lupin with a slight smile, 'we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.'\n    'I dunno if that's a good idea,' said Harry at once.\n    'Oh, I think it is,' growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. That'll be them, will it, Potter?'\n    He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee.\n    'Ah, Harry!' said Mr Weasley, turning from Hermione's parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. 'Well - shall we do it, then?'\n    'Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,' said Moody.\n    He and Mr Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group.\n    'Good afternoon,' said Mr Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him. 'You might remember me, my name's Arthur Weasley.'\n    As Mr Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys' living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, &s though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.\n    'We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry,' said Mr Weasley, still smiling.\n    'Yeah,' growled Moody. 'About how he's treated when he's at your place.'\n    Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.\n    'I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house - '\n    'I expect what you're not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,' growled Moody.\n    'Anyway, that's not the point,' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. 'The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry - '\n    - And make no mistake, we'll hear about it,' added Lupin pleasantly.\n    'Yes,' said Mr Weasley, 'even if you won't let Harry use the felly-tone -\n    'Telephone,' whispered Hermione.\n    - Yeah, if we get", "PPL": 0.6607381701469421, "PPL/lower": 0.64513845628816, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001905242705152659, "Min-5%": 12.594734792615853, "Min-10%": 6.616692747190302, "Min-20%": 3.305570065171383, "Min-30%": 2.202514889557995, "Min-40%": 1.6533780856441405, "Min-50%": 1.3220997475507585, "Min-60%": 1.1014037867642117}, {"text": ". It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\n\"What did he do when he saw you?\"\n\"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand\ngesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well ?that is\" ?he did the hand gesture again ?\"but why isn't he out there bullying first years?\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\n\"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Harry. \"I think he's ?quot;\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.\n\"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\" she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\n\"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n\"An invitation,\" said Harry.?/p> \nHarry,\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\nSincerely, . , .\n\"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n\"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\"\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n\"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden\nbuttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\"\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\n\"Now, do you know everyone?\" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \"Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course -?\"\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\n\"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you've come across each other ?? No?\"\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n\"?and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether ??\"\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.\n\"?and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished.\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back.\n\"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said Slughorn cozily. \"A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on\nlicorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?\"\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\n\"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\" Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \"Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\"\nUnfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\n\"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\n\"Not. . . not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\n\"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy,\" said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \"I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\"\n\"I suppose . . .\" said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \"Er ... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about...\"\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\n\"Now, you, Cormac,\" said Slughorn, \"I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\"\n\"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\" said McLaggen. \"We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour ?this was before he became Minister, obviously ?quot;\n\"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \"Now tell me . . .\"\nIt was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential ?everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair.\n\"And now,\" said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. \"Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \"'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!\"\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\n\"Of course,\" said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \"there have been rumors for years. ...", "PPL": 7.035452842712402, "PPL/lower": 1.0293481570936276, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019936108933727406, "Min-5%": 38.6964116750979, "Min-10%": 32.18354489756565, "Min-20%": 24.920727303092228, "Min-30%": 20.36129201584608, "Min-40%": 16.83442316894718, "Min-50%": 13.977109762347455, "Min-60%": 11.722789717025156}, {"text": ", tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore. \n\"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous. \n\"But one of them jumped,\" he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. \"When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\" \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\" Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry's bewildered expression. \n\"Oh . . . right. . .\" said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn't seen Ginny at all. . . \n\"Nearly there,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. \"Careful not to touch the water,\" said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat. \nThe island was no larger than Dumbledore's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow. \n\"What is it?\" asked Harry quietly. \n\"I am not sure,\" said Dumbledore. \"Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\" Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. \n\"Sir, no, don't touch \u2014 !\" \n\"I cannot touch,\" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \"See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\" \nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air. \n\"Out of the way, please, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore with-drew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again. \n\"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\" \n\"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. \"But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-etrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.\" Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \"I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\" \n\"What?\" said Harry. \"No!\" \n\"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\" \n\"But what if\u2014 what if it kills you?\" \n\"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,\" said Dumbledore easily. \"Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.\" Harry couldn't believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore's insane determination to see good in everyone? \n\"Sir,\" said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \"sir, this is Voldemort we're \u2014\" \n\"I'm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to im-mediately kill the person who reached this island,\" Dumbledore corrected himself. \"He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-fenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.\" \nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. \"Undoubtedly,\" he said, finally, \"this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-tracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?\" \nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along \u2014 so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain? \n\"You remember,\" said Dumbledore, \"the condition on which I brought you with me?\" \nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin. \n\"But what if\u2014?\" \n\"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\" \n\"Yes, but\u2014\" \n\"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but \u2014\" \n\"Well, then,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \"you have my orders.\" \n\"Why can't I drink the potion instead?\" asked Harry desperately. \n\"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\" said Dumbledore. \"Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\" \n\"Couldn't \u2014 ?\" \n\"Do I have it?\" \n\"But\u2014\" \n\"Your word, Harry.\" \n\"I \u2014all right, but\u2014\" \nBefore Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore low-ered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the gob-let, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. \"Your good health, Harry.\" \nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb. \n\"Professor?\" he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \"How do you feel?\" \nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more. \nIn silence, Dumbled", "PPL": 7.53820276260376, "PPL/lower": 0.9992958866480538, "PPL/zlib": 0.0022919436797214227, "Min-5%": 39.6737673516367, "Min-10%": 33.62386092017679, "Min-20%": 26.816589315829475, "Min-30%": 21.84771110180535, "Min-40%": 18.055314516379955, "Min-50%": 14.971080245277166, "Min-60%": 12.56021225917781}, {"text": "gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\n\u3000\u3000\"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose.\n\u3000\u3000The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\n\u3000\u3000HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran.\n\u3000\u3000One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\"\n\u3000\u3000shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\n\u3000\u3000Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy - Mullet - Mo ran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.\n\u3000\u3000The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova - oh I say!\" roared Bagman.\n\u3000\u3000One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was - \"They're going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000She was half right - at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's time-out!\" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course... .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT -DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.\n\u3000\u3000Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his\n\u3000\u3000Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\n\u3000\u3000After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals.\n\u3000\u3000They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.\n\u3000\u3000As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing -- excessive use of elbows!\"\n\u3000\u3000Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And - yes, it's a penalty to Ireland!\"\n\u3000\u3000The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again.", "PPL": 0.45609915256500244, "PPL/lower": 0.4363294714100901, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014094534998918495, "Min-5%": 8.881315713419633, "Min-10%": 4.563198807375396, "Min-20%": 2.281586495776886, "Min-30%": 1.5203309711398776, "Min-40%": 1.1412995842622105, "Min-50%": 0.9126273034101663, "Min-60%": 0.7602848949476455}], "retain": [{"text": "from opening the Chamber of Secrets again during his remaining years at Hogwarts. He\nwas also able to convince the Headmaster to allow Hagrid to remain at the school as the groundskeeper-in-training.[47]  Albus duelling his former lover As Dumbledore was educating young wizards and witches, Gellert Grindelwald was still at large in Europe, building up his army, and had already found one of the Deathly Hallows, the Elder Wand, which he used to continue terrorising the continent. Initially prevented from opposing Grindelwald directly because of the blood pact they once made, even once that was destroyed, Dumbledore still felt conflicted about going after his old friend. In spite of himself, he still felt a lingering love for the man Grindelwald had been, or rather, the man he had once convinced himself Grindelwald was and/or could be. More than anything, however, Dumbledore feared facing Grindelwald. While secure in his ability to defeat him in battle if it came to it, more than anything, Dumbledore was afraid Grindelwald could reveal to him that it had in fact been he himself who had cast the curse that killed Ariana.  Having delayed pursuing him as long as he could, however, at the height of Grindelwald's power, in 1945, Albus could no longer in good conscience turn a blind eye to the many atrocities of Grindelwald and his followers, and so he finally tracked his old friend down. Upon finding Grindelwald, Dumbledore engaged him in what would later be widely considered the greatest duel ever fought between two wizards. Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald and then brought him before the authorities of the magical world, and Grindelwald was imprisoned in the uppermost cell at Nurmengard, while Dumbledore kept the Elder Wand for himself.[28] Celebrated worldwide as the hero who put to rest the global wizarding war and ended Grindelwald's For the Greater Good revolution of wizarding dominance over Muggles, Dumbledore was awarded the Order of Merlin (First Class), by Leonard Spencer-Moon's administration.[48]  Resuming his career following this legendary event, Albus was offered the position of Minister for Magic several times, but he turned down the offer every time, remembering how his quest for power had been his weakness in the past. It was around this time that he encountered a house-elf named Hokey. Before she died, he took a memory from her, in which Tom Riddle showed his interest towards the magical antiques of the recently deceased Hepzibah Smith, whose death by a little-known poison had been blamed on Hokey. This memory was not sufficient evidence to show Hokey's innocence, as it only proved that Riddle was aware of the artefacts' existence.[46]  As though the opening of the legendary Chamber of Secrets some thirty odd years back had not been bad enough, however, a young witch by the name of Patricia Rakepick arrived at Hogwarts and eventually caught Dumbledore's attention not only by virtue of the fact that she had been unusually gifted magically, but also due to her extensive research into the fabled Cursed Vaults.[49] Myth would have it that there were a number of concealed rooms hidden in and around Hogwarts Castle; each shielded by a different\ncurse to guard priceless treasures of gold, prophecies and powerful magical artefacts dating back to before the school was founded.[50] Convinced that the vaults were real, Rakepick had tried to warn the staff about them, but seen as how neither she, nor anyone else for that matter, had ever come close enough to finding them to offer up any solid proof for their existence, her professors, Albus included, did not act on it at the time.[51]  Headmaster Dumbledore welcoming students to the new school term By the mid-1960s, the amount of Dark magical activity across the country was growing steadily, and while few knew what was behind the mounting attacks and sightings, this was but the precursor to Lord Voldemort's first rise to power. Aware that it was only a matter of time before his former student made his presence and intent known to the wizarding community at large and already preparing to actively oppose him, by the time the Death Eaters began recruiting Dark creatures to help them overthrow the Ministry of Magic,[52] and the Ministry, in turn, started to call upon the services of authorities on such matters to help it understand and contain the threat, the old Transfiguration teacher already had spies in their midst reporting to him.  It was through these contacts that Dumbledore first learned of the attack on a young boy by the name of Remus Lupin, who had been infected with lycanthropy by a Fenrir Greyback.[53] Rather than trying to manage his condition, however, the attacker had instead made it his mission in life to infect as many people as possible and was harbouring grand plans of raising an army of werewolves big enough to take over the wizarding community; and even earned quite a bit of notoriety for targeting children with the intent of raising them away from other witches and wizards in order to teach them to despise regular humans. Knowing how this would have had to have impacted the Lupin family, the old Transfiguration teacher could not help but be sympathetic to their predicament. As fortune would have it, however, a blessing in disguise presented itself when the Board of Governors was faced with the decision of finding a suitable candidate to succeed Armando Dippet and concluded that Professor Dumbledore was the best man for the job.[54]  This, in turn, granted him the authority to properly accommodate the Lupins when the time came for Remus to attend school. Shortly after Dumbledore assumed the position, by which time he had already relocated to the Headmaster's Tower and filled his new study with a number of curious magical instruments that had formerly been housed in his old classroom, Tom Riddle, now known exclusively as Lord Voldemort, approached him with the same request he had made to Dippet before him, to be allowed to return to Hogwarts as a teacher. Dumbledore, who knew of Voldemort's illicit activities since he left Hogwarts and suspected that he might have meant to use the position as means of recruiting more followers, turned down his application.\nThis led Voldemort to angrily jinx the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, preventing anyone from holding the position for more than a single school year. What was more; while being entrusted the stewardship of the school was, in and of itself, an honour and a privilege, it also meant that he was henceforth expected to shoulder the responsibility of making all the difficult decisions that came with leadership.  On such occasions, Dumbledore would step out into the Clock Tower Courtyard, where he found the quiet, starry night and the crisp air helpful in regard to putting one's troubles in perspective,[55] and developed a habit of pacing around his new office a lot, especially in troubled and trying times such as when the security of the castle was breached.[56][57] On occasion, he would also see students in his office, be it because of a misdemeanour that had to be addressed, or because one of the pupils sought redress during conflicts with their peers, such as Bertha Jorkins.[58] At some point following his appointment, Professor Dumbledore began to offer to help students with their homework, whom he would meet every Friday in Classroom E-13.[59] Fond of festivities in general, he would also usually stand for the entertainment during the annual Hallowe'en Feast in the Great Hall.[60]  As the day neared when young Remus Lupin would be of an eligible age to begin his magical education, Dumbledore wasted little time in making the necessary preparations for the young man's arrival: To this end, Dumbledore arranged for a house to be built a little way above the rest of the nearby Hogsmeade; perched atop a hill overlooking the village. Once finished, the Headmaster applied the appropriate spells to provide Remus with a safe and secure place for his transformations that could contain even a fully grown werewolf, if necessary. Next, he arranged for an underground passage to be made on the school grounds to give Remus an easy and discreet way of accessing the building when necessary and had a Whomping Willow planted over the opening; both to hide it from view, and as a security measure to stop anyone from coming across the future pupil whilst he was dangerous. Shortly before 10 March 1971, Dumbledore showed up unannounced at the doorstep of Lyall and Hope Lupin to invite their son to attend school.

The Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it.  Harry only stopped visiting the mirror after Dumbledore found him one night. Dumbledore found Harry and  explained what the mirror was all about. Dumbledore told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it. 1992 was the last time Harry saw his parents faces in the mirror. Later, at the end of Harry's first year, Rubeus Hagrid gave Harry a special photo album containing pictures of his parents.[24]  In his third year, whenever Harry encountered a Dementor, he was forced to relive his parents' deaths. The death he was particularly forced to relive was Lily's.[25][26] This could be due to Harry being in the same room as Lily when she died, while James was murdered in the hallway. Therefore, Harry did not witness nor hear James' death.  The echoes of James and Lily Potter after being awakened by Priori Incantatem In Harry's fourth year, Wormtail had placed Voldemort's rudimentary body into a cauldron containing the nearly finished potion. He added the first two ingredients: his hand and Harry's blood, as Voldemort believed it would make him stronger and make his enemy touchable. This was because he indirectly received Lily's sacrificial protection. However, this action also bound Harry's life to Voldemort again but inversely: Harry couldn't die as long as Voldemort still lived, which ironically meant he couldn't kill the boy.[27]  During Harry's duel with Voldemort in the Little Hangleton graveyard, they experienced Priori Incantatem. Shades of his mother and father, and others whom Voldemort had murdered came out of Voldemort's wand, encouraging Harry and distracting Voldemort so the younger wizard could escape from the graveyard.[28]  In his fifth year, Harry entered Severus Snape's memory of being bullied by James and Sirius via the use of Pensieve, and saw his mother standing up for Snape. He also witnessed Snape calling Lily a Mudblood, which instigated the end of their friendship. This was considered Snape's worst memory.[10]  In 1998, Harry relived that same memory of Snape's, as well as many others containing his mother, in the Pensieve after Snape's death. The memories revealed that she and Snape had been best friends since their childhood and brought to light Snape's unrequited and continuing love for Lily, years after her death.[3]  Harry temporarily brings back his family and friends with the Resurrection Stone Finally, during the Battle of Hogwarts, when Harry believed himself to be walking to his own death, he used the Resurrection Stone to bring back the spirits of Lily, James Potter, Sirius, and Remus. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were \"so very proud of him\" for his outstanding courage and strength, and assured him that they would stay with him\nuntil the very end. Harry described their very presence as his courage, the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with Lily smiling at him and James nodding encouragingly.[4]  Many years after Lily died, her son married Ginevra Weasley and fathered three children. Harry's only daughter, Lily Luna Potter, was named in memory of her paternal grandmother.[29]  Lily was a beautiful woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and almond-shaped, bright green eyes.[21] Apparently, her eyes were extremely distinctive, because every person who knew Lily would always see them in her son, Harry. When the aged Harry travelled back to the past, he commented that even in the face of death, she was still beautiful.  Lily was known for being a vivacious, talented, and popular student.[19] She was a responsible student and leader to be Head Girl in her final year at Hogwarts. Horace Slughorn noted that Lily was witty and charming.[30] Remus Lupin once described her as an uncommonly kind person with a habit of seeing the best in others, even when they could not see it themselves.[31]  Lily was a woman of sound moral principles and would stand by them no matter what it cost her, though her actions sometimes were ineffective. On at least one occasion, she called out James Potter and Sirius Black for their bullying of her best friend, Severus Snape. When she realised Snape's devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause (of which she was a target at the time) and increasingly deep fascination with the Dark Arts, she ended her friendship with him permanently.  Lily comforting infant Harry moments before her murder Though she had a sharp tongue and had no problems in standing up to others when she was in a temper, Lily was still the type of person who would give others a second chance when they had proven themselves worthy of it. The most notable instance of this quality would be how she finally agreed to date James after he had matured out of his bullying ways despite the fact that she didn't have a good opinion of him during their early school years.  Lily's and her husband's most celebrated virtues were their courage and capacity for self-sacrifice, defying Voldemort three times as members of the Order of the Phoenix and even dying to protect their son Harry. It was noted by Dumbledore that Lily was very much like her son, especially in strength. Her strength is further commented on by her grandson Albus in that she would understand her fate and the fact that she would never see her son grow up.[21]  Lily's corporeal doe Patronus Lily was considered such a powerful and accomplished witch, that Lord Voldemort overlooked her Muggle-born status and actively tried to recruit her.[14][32] Lily was noted for her particular talent in Potion-making. She was also able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the form of a doe, a mark of superior magical ability.[33]  Lily had a happy home life\nand a close relationship with her parents. They were very proud to learn that Lily was a witch and apparently favoured her over her older sister Petunia.  Petunia Dursley, her older sister Lily initially had a close relationship with Petunia, whom she often played with. When Lily began demonstrating magical ability, Petunia was \"torn between curiosity and disapproval\". Her sister was disdainful of the friendship Lily struck up with Severus Snape, the poor wizard who had taken to spying on Lily and informed her that she was a witch. In turn, Snape was quite insulting to Petunia for being a Muggle. When Lily was invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Petunia wrote to the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, requesting that she be permitted to do the same. Although his refusal was kind, Petunia became very bitter and jealously deemed her sister a \"freak\", even saying that their separation would be better for her safety.[21]  Lily and Petunia in their youth Their relationship seems to have deteriorated greatly and become distant afterward, especially after they dated and eventually married very different men. Despite the bitterness on Petunia's end, the two sisters appeared to still be in contact when Harry was an infant, was said to have \"smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent [Lily] for Christmas\". Petunia also grudgingly took her sister's son, Harry in, at Dumbledore's request, after Lily's death. However, even as an adult, Petunia resented that her parents were proud of Lily's magical abilities and took out her enmity on Harry.[21]  James Potter, her husband and father of her son Lily's relationship with James Potter was initially a volatile one. They first met on the Hogwarts Express just before the start of their first year at Hogwarts, at which time Lily was angered by James' and Sirius Black's mockery of her best friend, Severus.[21] Although James was a talented Quidditch player and well-liked by most, Lily considered him an \"arrogant bullying toerag\" and treated him with contempt, mostly for his bad habit of hexing innocent students for fun and his hostile relationship with Snape. However, she didn't hate James, admiring how he stood up for his friends and other people who were cruelly treated by aspiring-Death Eaters.

He was knowledgeable about wizard-goblin relations for his work. Despite being the eldest of seven children, he had a lively sense of humour and knew how to have fun.  He was very brave, working as a Curse-Breaker and joining the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Lord Voldemort. He was also of great compassion and loyalty, as he was displeased with how Ron would abandon Harry and Hermione over a little argument, but did not pursue the issue seeing Ron's clear regret, and allowed him to stay for the time being. After his mauling at the hands of Fenrir Greyback, it was feared that his personality would change and that he would take on some wolfish characteristics. However, Bill's personality remained intact, although he did develop a liking for very rare steaks.  When Bill met Harry Potter for the first time in 1994, Harry was taken by surprise at Bill's cool, laid-back demeanour; from everything Harry had heard from Ron, he had always pictured Bill as an older version of Percy, who was more serious and stuffy than all his siblings.  Given how\nBill earned twelve O.W.L.s in his fifth year, and subsequently participated in and survived the Second Wizarding War, he was an accomplished and skilful wizard with many magical gifts and talents.  Bill's wand The Weasley family Bill had a good relationship with all his family members but seemed to be particularly close to Charlie, the sibling closest to him in age and the one he chose as best man at his wedding.  Bill's younger siblings tended to look up to him, especially his only sister, Ginny. She supported Bill whenever their mother criticised his choice of hair and clothing, and a large part of her initial disdain for Fleur Delacour was her belief that the witch was not good enough for her brother. It is unclear whether Ginny ever made her dislike for Fleur known to Bill, but she eventually accepted their relationship. Ginny also tended to take Bill's opinion very seriously; when she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were discussing their hatred of Snape, she mentioned \"Bill doesn't like him either,\" as if her older brother's opinion should settle it.   Ron also admired Bill, partly because he was the only one of his siblings who did not tease him. Towards the end of 1997, when Ron temporarily abandoned Harry and Hermione during their search for Voldemort's Horcruxes, he stayed with Bill and Fleur at Shell Cottage. Although Bill was not impressed by his brother's actions, he realised how sorry Ron was about it and never mentioned it.   Normally, Percy did look up to Bill, but when Percy had a falling out with his family due to conflict of belief over the return of Lord Voldemort, Percy cut all ties with his family, Bill included, and was the only sibling not to attend Bill's wedding despite being issued an invitation.  Bill also got along well with his parents, though his mother constantly tried to pressure him into cutting his hair and not dressing as flashily as he liked to. She also disapproved of his choice of wife initially, though she came to accept Fleur once she realised how in love the couple was and their liking of one another was not based on looks as she had first believed.  Bill fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 with the rest of his family. He was devastated by his younger brother Fred's death and was seen comforting his wife Fleur in the Great Hall.  Bill also became the uncle to many Weasleys, through his brothers. He also had two Potter nephews and one Potter niece, through Ginny's marriage to Harry Potter, Bill's brother-in-law.  Fleur Delacour, his wife and future mother of his children Bill met Fleur Delacour in June 1995, when he accompanied his mother to Hogwarts to support Harry Potter during the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, in which she was also a Champion. Fleur was attracted to him immediately, eyeing him from a distance.  Shortly after, Bill moved back to England to work for the Order of the Phoenix,\ntaking a desk job at Gringotts. Fleur had taken a part-time job at the bank to improve her English, and the two began dating shortly after. After a year together Bill proposed and Fleur accepted. His mother felt it was too soon for him to get married and worried that he was only doing it in response to the return of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Fleur's blunt attitude and tendency to speak her mind irritated both Molly and Ginny. Mrs Weasley became convinced that their feelings for each other were based on physical attraction and the adventurous side of each other \u2014 him as a Curse Breaker, and her as a Triwizard Champion.    Following Bill's scarring during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Fleur showed her feelings for Bill by declaring that she still loved him no matter what he looked like, and her insistence that she would take care of his injuries. Her declaration convinced Mrs Weasley that her son had made the right choice, and the two women finally put aside their differences. Bill and Fleur married on 1 August 1997 and set up a home of their own, Shell Cottage.    Due to Fleur's declaration that she didn't care about his looks due to his scarring by Greyback, it served to indicate that she was attracted to Bill's courage, intelligence, and adventurous personality, as well as his interest in other cultures, which likely served to bridge the cultural gap between them.   After the Second Wizarding War, Bill and Fleur had three children; Victoire, Dominique and Louis.[52] It is likely he had a good relationship with all of them. In 2017, Victoire was seen snogging Teddy Lupin. Bill did develop a rather protective streak in regards to his eldest daughter, as he tactically interrupted her and Teddy's conversation during the Quidditch World Cup of 2014, much to the dismay of the teenagers' budding romance.   Harry Potter, his friend and future brother-in-law Bill first met Harry Potter in 1994, around the time of the Quidditch World Cup. Harry found Bill cool, but he expected Bill to be like an older version of Percy Weasley and was surprised and grateful to learn that he was not. Harry was Ron's best friend and Bill was sometimes like an older brother for Harry, as well.  Bill and his mother visited Hogwarts in 1995, during the Triwizard Tournament, at the time Harry was taking part in his third task. Harry was very glad to see them because he did not expect anyone to come to watch him. Bill also stuck by Harry's side in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task and \"Harry saw Mrs Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him\", showing that he cared for Harry's well-being.  Bill and Harry fought together in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. After the battle, Harry was shocked when he learned about Bill's injuries from\nFenrir Greyback. He participated in Bill and Fleur's wedding and later stayed for a short time at their house, Shell Cottage. Bill also advised Harry not to attempt to deceive goblins. They also fought together in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the war.  After the Second Wizarding War, they became brothers-in-law. Harry married Bill's younger sister (Ginny Weasley). Bill also had two nephews (James Sirius and Albus Severus) and one niece (Lily Luna) through Harry's marriage to Ginny.  Hermione Granger, his future sister-in-law Bill met Hermione Granger in the summer of 1994, prior to Hermione's fourth year at Hogwarts. Although they were not very close, Hermione seemed to like Bill and the fact that he was a top student, which she heard from Ron and Percy. Hermione fought alongside Bill at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower; after the battle, Hermione visited Bill at Hogwarts' hospital wing, while she, members of the Order of the Phoenix and others discussed Dumbledore's death at the hands of Severus Snape. Hermione participated at the wedding of Bill and Fleur, and she later stayed for a short time at their house. Bill was upset when he heard that Hermione had been tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange.

At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied, to the point where she was nearly made a Ravenclaw by the Sorting Hat.  Hermione first met her future best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an \"insufferable know-it-all\", an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they\nhad saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends. She later played a crucial role in protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort.     In her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, before falling victim to the Basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. However, she recovered from the petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with Professor Sprout's Mandrake Restorative Draught. The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.  During her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W., and helped in Harry's preparation for the Triwizard Tournament. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's Army and fought alongside fellow D.A. members in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.  Hermione played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, as well. In 1997, she fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters, alongside the Order of the Phoenix. Hermione and Ron decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies, instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, a quest in which several of her actions were essential. She destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup, a Horcrux, with Ron using a Basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione then fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, helping in the defeat of the Death Eater who tortured her: Bellatrix Lestrange.  Following the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education. She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves. Afterward, she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of pure-bloods. Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo. She became the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest son James. By the year 2019, Hermione had become the thirty-sixth Minister for Magic.  A young Hermione with her parents Hermione Granger was born to Mr and Mrs Granger, both dentists, on 19 September 1979. She was their only child and daughter.[28] The couple choose \"a nice, unusual\" first name for her because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were, while also knowing that she would be unique and special.[29] Mr and Mrs Granger were \"a bit bemused\" by the oddities displayed by their daughter, but they were proud and accepting of her nonetheless.\nThe couple gave Hermione a bedroom on the first-floor of their house,[30] and they lived happily for many years.  A young Hermione before starting Hogwarts Upon turning eleven, Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend Hogwarts. She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the September of 19", "PPL": 0.09142351895570755, "PPL/lower": 0.13185861258209827, "PPL/zlib": 2.9721560128643546e-05, "Min-5%": 1.7775264598575293, "Min-10%": 0.9091989395446053, "Min-20%": 0.45636804509238504, "Min-30%": 0.30449786462625017, "Min-40%": 0.2287011051536703, "Min-50%": 0.18291314563228392, "Min-60%": 0.152390973735862}, {"text": "by stating that she had decided that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with Professor Umbridge, and thus changed it to Jean, which is a female variant of the name John, meaning \"God is gracious\".[77]  Granger is another word for farmer; specifically, it was the title of a farm bailiff, who oversaw the collection of rent and taxes from the barns of a feudal lord. It is a surname of English and French origin, derived from the Anglo-Norman grainger and the French grangier, both of which come from Latin granica, meaning \"granary\". It recalls Hermione's Muggle roots. Her original last name was \"Puckle\", but Rowling later decided this didn't suit her character.  The reason of choosing such an uncommon name as Hermione for the character is because, according to Rowling, she did not bear getting any child mocked because of sharing a name with an \"insufferable know-it-all\" such as Hermione.

Vinyl Hermione Granger as seen in Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells Hermione as depicted in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened J. K. Rowling has said that she loosely based Hermione at the age of eleven on herself at the same age, though an exaggerated version:  Rowling has gone on to say that Hermione, Harry, and Ron are all \"a bit like different parts of my personality\" as well as her favourite characters, along with Rubeus Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore, Fred and George Weasley, and Luna Lovegood,[79] and that Hermione and Dumbledore were the most useful characters for exposition.[80] She also identified Hermione as \"the most brilliant\" of her group of friends and confirmed that \"Harry needs her badly.\"[88] Rowling has also said that she considers Hermione to be \"a very strong female character,\" as well as \"the brightest character.\"[89]  Rowling has also stated that, from a feminist point of view, she is very proud of Hermione. In her words, Hermione does not \"play\nthe game\" in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman. Hermione never makes Ron \"feel better\" by pretending to be less than she is; she always preserves who she is and waits for Ron to catch up. In general, Rowling regards her as a heroine, but isn't sexy nor entirely sexless, but a \"real girl.\"  Rowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine Wonderland in February of 2014 that, with hindsight, she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of Ron as a partner for Hermione and believes that in some ways, Harry might have made a better romantic partner for her:  She went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible, but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility. However, according to Rowling, they could \"probably be alright\" with a bit of marriage counselling, as Ron needed to work on his self-esteem issues while Hermione needed to learn to be less critical. She concluded with the statement that just like herself, the uptight Hermione had a real weakness for a funny man. Ultimately, Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another.[90]    Armando Dippet \u00b7 Albus Dumbledore \u00b7 Barberus Bragge \u00b7 Bertie Bott \u00b7 Carlotta Pinkstone \u00b7 Dzou Yen \u00b7 Falco Aesalon \u00b7 Godric Gryffindor \u00b7 Harry Potter \u00b7 Herpo the Foul \u00b7 Helga Hufflepuff \u00b7 Montague Knightley \u00b7 Phillipus von Hohenheim \u00b7 Rowena Ravenclaw \u00b7 Salazar Slytherin  Alberic Grunnion \u00b7 Alberta Toothill \u00b7 Andros the Invincible \u00b7 Artemisia Lufkin \u00b7 Blenheim Stalk \u00b7 Bowman Wright \u00b7 Chauncey Oldridge \u00b7 Circe \u00b7 Cliodna \u00b7 Crispin Cronk \u00b7 Cyprian Youdle \u00b7 Daisy Dodderidge \u00b7 Derwent Shimpling \u00b7 Donaghan Tremlett \u00b7 Dunbar Oglethorpe \u00b7 Dymphna Furmage \u00b7 Elfrida Clagg \u00b7 Felix Summerbee \u00b7 Fulbert the Fearful \u00b7 Gaspard Shingleton \u00b7 Gideon Crumb \u00b7 Glenda Chittock \u00b7 Gondoline Oliphant \u00b7 Gregory the Smarmy \u00b7 Gwenog Jones \u00b7 Honoria Nutcombe \u00b7 Ignatia Wildsmith \u00b7 Joscelind Wadcock \u00b7 Kirley Duke \u00b7 Laverne de Montmorency \u00b7 Leopoldina Smethwyck \u00b7 Maeve \u00b7 Mirabella Plunkett \u00b7 Mopsus \u00b7 Morgan le Fay \u00b7 Oswald Beamish \u00b7 Roderick Plumpton \u00b7 Sacharissa Tugwood \u00b7 Thaddeus Thurkell \u00b7 Wendelin the Weird \u00b7 Xavier Rastrick  Adalbert Waffling \u00b7 Almeric Sawbridge \u00b7 Archibald Alderton \u00b7 Balfour Blane \u00b7 Beatrix Bloxam \u00b7 Beaumont Marjoribanks \u00b7 Bridget Wenlock \u00b7 Burdock Muldoon \u00b7 Cassandra Vablatsky \u00b7 Celestina Warbeck \u00b7 Cornelius Agrippa \u00b7 Devlin Whitehorn \u00b7 Dorcas Wellbeloved \u00b7 Edgar Stroulger \u00b7 Elladora Ketteridge \u00b7 Ethelred the Ever-Ready \u00b7 Flavius Belby \u00b7 Gifford Ollerton \u00b7 Glanmore Peakes \u00b7 Glover Hipworth \u00b7 Greta Catchlove \u00b7 Grogan Stump \u00b7 Gulliver Pokeby \u00b7 Gunhilda de Gorsemoor \u00b7 Havelock Sweeting \u00b7 Hengist of Woodcroft \u00b7 Heathcote Barbary \u00b7 Herman Wintringham \u00b7 Hesper Starkey \u00b7 Jocunda Sykes \u00b7 Justus Pilliwickle \u00b7 Merlin \u00b7 Merton Graves \u00b7 Merwyn the Malicious \u00b7 Miranda Goshawk \u00b7 Mungo Bonham \u00b7\nMusidora Barkwith \u00b7 Myron Wagtail \u00b7 Newton Scamander \u00b7 Norvel Twonk \u00b7 Orsino Thruston \u00b7 Perpetua Fancourt \u00b7 Quong Po \u00b7 Roland Kegg \u00b7 Stoddard Withers \u00b7 Tilly Toke \u00b7 Uric the Oddball \u00b7 Yardley Platt  Blodwyn Bludd \u00b7 Vlad Drakul \u00b7 Amarillo Lestoat \u00b7 Carmilla Sanguina \u00b7 Herbert Varney  Babayaga \u00b7 Malodora Grymm \u00b7 Old Mother Hubbard \u00b7 Cordelia Misericordia \u00b7 Leticia Somnolens  Bran the Bloodthirsty \u00b7 Cyclops \u00b7 Goliath \u00b7 Morholt \u00b7 Hengist of Upper Barnton  Alguff the Awful \u00b7 Eargit the Ugly \u00b7 Gringott \u00b7 Ug the Unreliable \u00b7 Urg the Unclean  Common Welsh Green \u00b7 Hebridean Black \u00b7 Hungarian Horntail \u00b7 Norwegian Ridgeback \u00b7 Romanian Longhorn  Billywig \u00b7 Bowtruckle \u00b7 Doxy \u00b7 Double-ended Newt \u00b7 Giant Purple Toad \u00b7 Giant Squid \u00b7 Gnome \u00b7 Gytrash \u00b7 Imp \u00b7 Kelpie \u00b7 Manticore \u00b7 Mountain troll \u00b7 Streeler \u00b7 Phoenix \u00b7 Unicorn\n\n\nAt least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\u00a0& Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells\u00a0& Harry Potter: Magic Awakened.As such, spoilers will be present within the article.

This is evidenced by her blackmailing Rita Skeeter into writing a good article about Harry,[4] as well as slapping Draco Malfoy when he insulted Hagrid and drawing her wand on him, using a Confundus Charm on Cormac McLaggen for insulting her friends and placing a jinx on the list of DA members that would cause them to sprout boils all over their face in the word \"SNEAK\" if they betrayed the organisation. Malfoy, Rita Skeeter and Marietta Edgecombe all served as examples of Hermione's ferocity.   Hermione urging Harry and Ron to take studying seriously Because of her opinionated, interfering nature, Hermione had the reputation for being a bossy know-it-all. Her sometimes abrasive attitude masked deep insecurities and fear of failure, as personified by her Boggart.[54] She felt the need to prove herself, perhaps partly because of how many people in wizarding society looked down on Muggle-borns. However, she didn't let anyone bully her about this and ignored bigots like Draco Malfoy. Despite her growing confidence in her abilities, Hermione wasn't arrogant or conceited, and helped her classmates with their schoolwork whenever she could. In her fifth year, she also became one of the few people to call Voldemort by name.[31]  Though she initially showed a tendency toward mild panic in sudden situations,[3] in time she was able to overcome this trait of hers, and demonstrated her bravery and extreme loyalty to her friends many times when facing danger, risking her life frequently to help them and standing by Harry even when no one else did. Although she wasn't as short-tempered as her friends, Hermione displayed a formidable fury on several occasions, such as slapping Draco Malfoy in defence of\nHagrid,[33] sabotaging Cormac McLaggen's tryout as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team after he insulted Ron and Ginny, conjuring a flock of canaries to attack Ron in their sixth year[35] and physically attacking him when he briefly abandoned her and Harry during their hunt for Horcruxes.[10] She also tended to be rather argumentative, a trait most evident in her interactions with Ron.  Hermione's corporeal Patronus (form of an otter) Hermione proved to be an extremely powerful and talented young witch. Even before she began her education at Hogwarts, she practised some simple spells which all worked.[3] Remus Lupin claimed that Hermione was the cleverest witch of her age he had ever met.[33] Her magical capability easily surpassed almost every single student in her year, challenged only by a select few.  Hermione being the first in her class to master the Levitation Charm Hermione erasing Antonin Dolohov's memories Hermione conjuring a wreath of flowers in Godric's Hollow, Christmas 1997 Hermione and Ron duelling Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries Hermione freezing Neville Longbottom with the Full Body-Bind Curse in her first year Hermione being one of only twelve students attending a N.E.W.T.-level Potions class Hermione Granger handling a Mandrake in a second year Herbology class Hermione healing a Splinched Ron with Essence of Dittany in 1997 Hermione demonstrating her duelling reflexes by blasting Fenrir Greyback during the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione's first wand Crookshanks The Tales of Beedle the Bard Hogwarts: A History (Hermione's favourite book) Hermione in her dress robes Hermione's Yule Ball earrings The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand Mrs Granger, her mother Mr and Mrs Granger were Muggle dentists who seemed proud of their witch daughter. They appeared to be accepting of the wizarding world, as they went shopping with Hermione in Diagon Alley and allowed her to spend several holidays with the Weasley family,[4] but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick-fix, as indicated by their not allowing Hermione to magically fix her teeth.[34] They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year,[31] but other than one holiday in France with her parents, Hermione spent almost all of her time in the wizarding world. In 1995, she planned to go skiing with them during the Christmas holidays, but ended up going to 12 Grimmauld Place to try to cheer Harry up instead. Hermione told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams, indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter's involvement in activities relating to the Second Wizarding War.[31]  Mr Granger, her father To protect them during the height of the war, Hermione modified her parents' memories in 1997 to make them believe they were entirely different people, and they left the country.[10] After the war, she found them in Australia and restored their memories.  Hermione hugging Rose before Rose departs for school After the Second Wizarding War, Hermione\nhad two children with Ron Weasley: a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.  Rose started her first year at Hogwarts in 2017, along with her cousin, Albus. Ron stated that Rose had inherited her mother's brains. Hermione was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart, yet not a complete know-it-all.  Hugo was born in 2006 or 2007. He most likely inherited his father's Quidditch skills, as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins Albus Potter and James Potter. He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour.  The Potter children, some of Hermione's nieces and nephews As four of Ron Weasley's five surviving siblings were married by 2017, Hermione had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband: Harry and Ginny had three children (James, Albus and Lily), as did Bill and Fleur (Victoire, Dominique and Louis), while George and Angelina Johnson had a son and a daughter (Fred and Roxanne), and Percy Weasley had two daughters (Molly and Lucy) with his wife, Audrey. Victoire Weasley, one of Fleur and Bill's daughters, was seen kissing Teddy Lupin at King's Cross Station, by James Potter, Hermione's nephew and godson. Hermione visited them all on many occasions. It can be assumed that she was closest with Harry's children.  The Weasley family, her future in-laws Because of her friendships with Ron and Ginny Weasley, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of the Burrow, and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and attending the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with them. Arthur Weasley was fascinated by the Muggle world and thus Hermione's background, and even invited Hermione's parents for a drink upon first meeting them. Molly Weasley was fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry Potter and Viktor Krum, much to Hermione's bewilderment. After Harry explained that the stories were false, Mrs Weasley once again warmed up to Hermione. Also, she and Percy Weasley were considered to be on good terms until their fight over elf rights.  Fred and George Weasley, her friends and future brothers-in-law Fred and George Weasley seemed to regard Hermione and Harry almost like other younger siblings, teasing them as well as being protective of them. When Draco Malfoy called Hermione a \"Mudblood\" in 1992, the twins were outraged, and attempted to attack him.[4] Although Hermione disapproved of some of their antics, trying to use her status as a prefect to keep them in line, she still got on well", "PPL": 0.0966155007481575, "PPL/lower": 0.17478107874706267, "PPL/zlib": 2.6845096067840374e-05, "Min-5%": 1.9218580493995665, "Min-10%": 0.965054108313851, "Min-20%": 0.4826435795256499, "Min-30%": 0.3218465119143167, "Min-40%": 0.24168809740125283, "Min-50%": 0.19329763681998563, "Min-60%": 0.16104395143807446}, {"text": "Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in Australia, no longer aware of their original identities, the existence of their daughter, or anything she had told them about Harry. She also withdrew all of her savings at her building society account, in event of a need for Muggle money.[10].   The seven Potters and their protectors right before the sky battle Hermione then joined the Order of the Phoenix in the operation to remove Harry from 4 Privet Drive before his 17th birthday, taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the \"seven Potters\". Hermione flew on a Thestral with Kingsley Shacklebolt. The two fought off at least five Death Eaters, possibly killing one, injuring two, and were pursued by Lord Voldemort himself at one point. In time, they arrived safely at the Burrow, where Hermione was immensely relieved to see Harry alive and ran to him and hugged him tight, but she was greatly worried when Ron did not show up on time. When he landed, she ran and nuzzled him in relief. She was saddened by the news of Alastor Moody and Hedwig's murders and disturbed by Harry's vision of Garrick Ollivander being tortured.  Scrimgeour giving the trio the items left for them in Albus Dumbledore's will Later on, the Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, interrupted Harry's birthday celebrations to execute Albus Dumbledore's will and bequeath some of his belongings to the three friends. Hermione received The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a book of children's stories written in runes. Even before Hermione understood the priceless quality of the gift, she was moved to tears by Dumbledore's great act of friendship. During the reading of Dumbledore's will, she also displayed her incredible store of general knowledge when she mentioned that \"Snitches have flesh memories\", surprising both Ron and Harry, who had both believed her to know little to nothing of Quidditch.  At Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding on 1 August, 1997, Hermione wore a \"floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels\" and made her hair \"sleek and shiny\". She was amused by Fred and George's stories about their late uncle Bilius and shared a friendly exchange with Viktor Krum, to the frustration of Ron. She was happily surprised when Ron quickly asked her to dance, and when Krum asked a disguised Harry whether the two were together, Harry replied \"Er... sort of.\"[10]  Kingsley's Patronus warning the wedding attendees of the Ministry's fall The wedding was interrupted by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus who told the guests of the fall of the Ministry of Magic. Hermione was prepared to make a quick escape, immediately Disapparating herself, Harry, and Ron away from the danger. Hermione\nalso showed great foresight and magical talent when she revealed a small beaded purse on which she had placed an Undetectable Extension Charm. Within it she had packed, amongst other things, clothing, a tent, healing supplies, Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and several useful books. They arrived on the Muggle street, Tottenham Court Road, where Hermione suggested they enter a caf\u00e9, as a means to get out of the open.  Hermione casting Petrificus Totalus on Antonin Dolohov However, minutes later Hermione unknowingly triggered the Taboo jinx that was placed on Voldemort's name, and the trio were thus tracked down by Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle. After a brief but violent skirmish, the Death Eaters were subdued, and Hermione modified their memories to throw them off the scent and to maintain Ron's cover story that he was sick with spattergroit and bedridden at home. At Harry's suggestion the three then made their way safely to 12 Grimmauld Place, as they could not hide anywhere within the wizarding world.[10]  After learning from Mundungus Fletcher that Dolores Umbridge had Tom Riddle's mother's locket - one of the seven Horcruxes - in her possession, the trio formed a plan to infiltrate the Ministry and reclaim the locket. Hermione imbibed Polyjuice Potion and transformed to look like Mafalda Hopkirk, a prominent Ministry official. She was forced to sit through the trials of Alderton and Mary Cattermole, innocent Muggle-borns, right alongside Umbridge and Death Eater Yaxley. Hermione tricked Umbridge into telling her about the locket, which she claimed was a Selwyn family heirloom.  Harry casting his Patronus at Dementors while in the trial courtroom, before capturing the locket When Harry attacked Umbridge in a rage, their cover was blown, but she and Harry managed to free the Muggle-born prisoners and encouraged them to flee the country while Voldemort was in power. Hermione took the locket from Umbridge, replacing it with a copy using the Geminio spell. They met up with Ron again and fled the Ministry, but Yaxley grabbed onto Hermione's arm while they were Disapparating. This meant that he was unwittingly brought inside the enchantment making Grimmauld Place undetectable, and forced Hermione to use a Revulsion Jinx to free herself from him, and then to take the trio away from Grimmauld Place.[10]  Harry and Ron rowing before Ron abandoned the hunt The locket caused great pain among the three friends due to the negative energy within. They began arguing over petty issues such as cooking, and growing moodier. The negative energy from the locket caused Ron to accuse Harry of poor leadership. They fought physically, resulting in Hermione having to stop them before they could start casting spells by casting a Shield Charm between them. Ron also accused Hermione of choosing Harry over him, causing him to be jealous and feel left out by his two friends' growing friendship. He declared he was leaving and stormed out of the tent.  By the time she got rid of the shield charm, all Hermione could do was scream for him to come back, without success. Hermione\nthen cried over Ron for more than a week after his departure, although she tried to hide it from Harry. Both were deeply saddened and hurt by their friend's departure, Hermione more than Harry, as she cried over Ron's departure for weeks. With Ron gone, Hermione and Harry's evenings were spent in mostly silence, while they contemplated Ron's abandonment and the places Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes might be hidden.  Hermione in Bathilda Bagshot's cottage, holding the The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore Hermione and Harry soon decided to go to Godric's Hollow, to see the graves of Harry's parents and to speak to historian Bathilda Bagshot. They believed Bathilda might be holding onto Godric Gryffindor's Sword for Harry, as they thought Dumbledore might have left it with her as an old family friend, knowing it was the only method the trio knew for destroying a Horcrux. Hermione comforted Harry in the graveyard when they found the Potters' graves; she nuzzled her head in to the crook between his head and shoulders and conjured roses for the graves. On their way out of the graveyard they came into contact with what appeared to be Bathilda.   The pair then went to Bathilda's house; whilst in the house they were separated. Harry witnessed a giant snake pouring from the neck of Bathilda's body and was attacked by Nagini upstairs. Nagini had been waiting for them in the guise of the old woman, whose corpse had been animated like an Inferius by Voldemort. Hermione rushed to Harry's aid and proceeded to save his life by casting a Blasting Cure, which ricocheted around the room. The two of them barely escaped before Lord Voldemort himself arrived at the cabin in an attempt to capture Harry.  Harry and Hermione talking about Albus Dumbledore in the forest of Dean Hermione Apparated to the Forest of Dean, while Harry was overcome with pain and visions of Voldemort's attack on his parents and him in 1981. She used a Severing Charm to remove the locket from Harry and healed the bite Nagini had given him with dittany. Harry's wand had also been broken in the foray, most likely by the Blasting Curse Hermione cast at Nagini. Hermione was very upset a the thought that it was her curse that broke Harry's wand. Harry was heartbroken, but not angry with her, knowing that it was an accident and that Hermione had saved his life", "PPL": 0.10865305364131927, "PPL/lower": 0.17416858170702998, "PPL/zlib": 2.966231330639347e-05, "Min-5%": 2.1432361439893057, "Min-10%": 1.0808570576265601, "Min-20%": 0.5419958043783165, "Min-30%": 0.36177862520463894, "Min-40%": 0.27176978285454295, "Min-50%": 0.21737391617171475, "Min-60%": 0.1811077155750505}, {"text": "amounts of work Draco managed to repair the Vanishing Cabinet and used it to let at least six Death Eaters into the castle: Corban Yaxley, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Gibbon, Thorfinn Rowle, and the vicious werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Proceeding to the top of the Astronomy Tower, Draco was able to corner a significantly weaker Dumbledore, disarming the latter the same instant he had, unknown to Draco, bound Harry Potter with a Full Body-Bind Curse.[19] It was also at the moment when he disarmed Dumbledore that he unknowingly gained the allegiance of the Elder Wand, one of the three Deathly Hallows.[21]  However, when Draco was finally given the opportunity to kill Dumbledore, who had just expressed his willingness to protect Draco and his family were they to 'come over to the right side', he could not bring himself to commit murder; considering that they spent the few minutes of alone time to discuss how Draco smuggled his accomplices into the castle, Dumbledore concluded that Draco would find committing murder impossible. As predicted, Draco ultimately was unable to do it, instead lowering his wand. Snape, who had made an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to step in if Draco failed in his task, used the Killing Curse on the Headmaster. Snape then promptly led Draco out of the school grounds, presumably to safety, but really to get to a safe distance to disapparate to Lord Voldemort.[19]  Draco disarming Albus Dumbledore on top of the Astronomy Tower After the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Draco could no longer return to Hogwarts, as he was an accomplice, however reluctantly, in the revered Albus Dumbledore's murder, mainly by being the one who let Death Eaters penetrate the castle's walls. The official criminal status placed on him, alongside his fear of the Dark Lord's wrath, led him to seek refuge, along with his family, with Voldemort, in the hopes of satisfying his orders to prevent any more negative highlights.[19]  His abrupt departure from\nthe school left Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle surprisingly lonely, despite the two being hulking boys, as Harry described during Dumbledore's funeral.[19]  Draco ambiguously recognising Harry when he was brought to Lord Voldemort's headquarters by Snatchers Draco reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities before the beginning of the 1997\u20131998 school year. Due to Draco's helpful role in Dumbledore's death, Voldemort liberated Lucius from Azkaban. He witnessed the murder of Charity Burbage and tortured Thorfinn Rowle on Lord Voldemort's orders. Judging by later remarks made by Vincent Crabbe, it seems that the Malfoys had lost much of their influence in the Death Eater circles. This is due to Voldemort no longer holding Lucius in high esteem and shifting his favour to Draco's maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange and Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape.   When Thorfinn Rowle and Antonin Dolohov failed to capture Harry, Voldemort forced Draco to torture them via the Cruciatus Curse as punishment, with the threat of Voldemort's wrath if Draco failed to comply. Harry, who saw this scene via his mental link with Voldemort, was disgusted at what the Dark Lord was forcing the young Death Eater to commit.[21]  The trio escape Malfoy Manor with Dobby's help Draco attended his seventh year of Hogwarts that year. During the Easter holidays, Draco was seen at home in Malfoy Manor. He was called upon by his parents and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange to confirm the identities of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback, but Draco showed great hesitation in doing so. When Hermione lied to Bellatrix under torture about Godric Gryffindor's Sword, Draco was sent to fetch the goblin, Griphook, from the dungeons to get confirmation of the story, which he did by lying saying it was a fake, but the truth was it was the true sword. Later in the evening, the prisoners managed to escape, and Draco's wand was taken by Harry. Afterwards, Draco and his family were detained to the Manor by Lord Voldemort. Narcissa would lend Draco her wand; it was powerful, yet it didn't 'understand' him, as he had not won its loyalty.[21]  Draco with his parents during the second-half of the Battle of Hogwarts Later that same year, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, chose to remain in the school as their fellow Slytherins evacuated in order to bring Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. Given Lucius' previous remarks alluding to 'forgiveness', it is likely that Draco was doing this in an attempt to redeem his family in Voldemort's eyes. He along with Crabbe and Goyle followed the Trio into the Room of Requirement where he would attempt to capture Harry and retrieve the item Harry was trying to locate. However, he no longer exercised the same degree of control over his friends, particularly Crabbe, that he once had.[21]  Harry saving Draco from Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement Despite Draco telling his friends that Harry was to be brought back alive, Crabbe attempted to kill him by conjuring\nFiendfyre. Since Crabbe was unable to control the curse, the Room of Requirement quickly filled with fire. Draco went out of his way to try to save both of his friends, but he only managed to get Goyle, who had been stunned by Hermione during the fight, onto Ron and Hermione's broom before he let Harry fly them out. Crabbe was killed in the fire, leaving Draco very upset.[21]  Harry, Hermione, and Ron later spotted Draco pleading with a Death Eater that he was on his side. Harry stunned the Death Eater and Ron punched Draco and called him a 'two-faced bastard', as this was the second time they saved his life that night.[21]  Although Draco was unaware of this, his act in disarming Dumbledore before his death and mastering the Elder Wand ultimately resulted in the Dark Lord's final defeat at the hands of Harry. This is due to the fact that Voldemort was unable to fully understand the Elder Wand's power and Harry disarming Draco of his wand resulted in him mastering the Elder Wand himself.[21]  After Voldemort's defeat, Draco and his parents sat in the Great Hall, looking uncertain of their place during the victory celebrations.[21]  Draco with his wife and son in 2017 The events of Draco's teenage years forever changed his life. He had the beliefs in which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way, had experienced terror and despair, witnessed his parents suffering for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in.  Draco and his family avoided imprisonment in Azkaban due to their last-minute switch in allegiance. Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but refusing to follow the old pure-blood line.[1]  Draco eventually married Astoria Greengrass, the younger sister of fellow Slytherin classmate Daphne Greengrass,[22] who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more accepting and tolerant way of life. This was something of a disappointment for Lucius and Narcissa, who had higher hopes of someone whose family featured on the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight'.[1]  Draco with his son Scorpius The two had a son together, named Scorpius Malfoy, who was raised by his mother not to believe that Muggles and Muggle-borns were scum; as such, family gatherings were fraught with tension.[1] Draco raised Scorpius to be a much kinder and more accepting Malfoy than he was in his youth.[1]  On 1 September 2017 while sending his son off for his first year at Hogwarts, Draco greeted Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny at King's Cross Station with a curt nod.

She also became jealous of Harry's friendship with Hermione Granger, convinced they had feelings for each-other, and in a moment of weakness and insecurity, ditched the date. Harry, who was inexperienced with girls, found Cho's behaviour very confusing, especially when she tried to make him jealous and to gauge his feelings for her by mentioning that Roger Davies had asked her out, and ultimately leaving him in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop for the other customers to stare at him astonishingly.  Cho and Harry kissing under some mistletoe Unimpressed with her attitude and for souring his experience of a first date, Harry grew angry at her. Though they eased up a bit after Cho read Harry's interview in The Quibbler, the strike that broke the relationship was when Marietta Edgecombe betrayed the D.A. and Cho stood up for her, angering Harry, who in turn again became angry with Harry and paranoid that he and Hermione were in a relationship.[6] After that, their relationship simply 'fell apart'.[9]  When Cho saw Harry on the Hogwarts Express at the end of the 1995\u20131996 school year, and again at the start of the 1996-1997 school year, she avoided him both times, as she was too embarrassed (and possibly still angry), for them to look at each other, let alone talk to each other.[6][9] On the other hand, Harry found himself not caring about Cho anymore due to his godfather Sirius Black's death being far more devastating to him than their break-up,[6] seemingly disregarding Cho with indifference as opposed to embarrassment. As for Marietta, he sneered at her limited success of hiding her disfigurement.[9]  However, by 1998, any negative feelings on Cho's part seemed to have vanished, as she offered to escort Harry to Ravenclaw Tower just before the Battle of Hogwarts. She was disappointed when Ginny Weasley fiercely suggested that Luna Lovegood escort him instead, suggesting that Cho may have appreciated some alone time with Harry, whether because of any lingering feelings or just because she would've liked to talk with him since after their fallout. Harry, on the other hand, did not so much as hesitate in accepting Ginny's suggestion and Luna's escort, indicating that he was still angry and/or indifferent towards her and had no interest in mending their relationship (though it is also possible that the then tense and desperate situation with Voldemort and his forces left Harry with little time or emotional energy to devote to Cho).[10]  One of the reasons for Harry's attraction to Ginny was\ndue to her being rarely weepy when she was upset.[10] This contrasts with Cho, whose depression after her boyfriend's death led to her crying frequently, which Harry did not know how to handle. Harry had always envisioned that any time they spent together would involve Cho enjoying herself, not crying on his shoulder, showing that he had little desire in spending time comforting her to begin with. Eventually, Harry implied that Cho's depression and crying were things that he had to 'cope' with, leading her to storming away due to this insensitivity.[6]  Michael Corner, her ex-boyfriend At the end of her sixth year, after the end of her relationship with Harry, Cho began dating Michael Corner, a Ravenclaw student a year below her. Michael's ex-girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, said that this happened shortly after she chucked Michael when he became sulky over a Ravenclaw-Gryffindor Quidditch match. Michael seems to have offered Cho comfort.[6] They may have continued to date even after Cho graduated from Hogwarts, as she went to sit by his side in the Room of Requirement upon returning to the school for the final battle.[10] However, they must have broken up at some point because she eventually married a Muggle.  Marietta Edgecombe, her best friend Marietta Edgecombe was Cho's friend and a fellow Ravenclaw. Marietta joined Dumbledore's Army mainly because Cho wanted her to; she was uncomfortable with opposing Dolores Umbridge because her mother worked at the Ministry of Magic. Cho thought no less of her for either Marietta's cynicism about the club nor Marietta's ultimate betrayal, seeing it as a forgivable mistake and being emphatically more upset that Hermione's jinx would cause an acne scar on Marietta's face for the rest of her life. She is more upset and defensive of this when she and Harry eventually talked about it, which became the straw that broke the camel's back in their relationship.[6]  Cho was, until the beginning of her sixth year, very popular. She had an entire group of Ravenclaw girl friends, who were constantly giggling, Marietta being one of them. However, as because of Cho's depression and grief-induced mood swings, all the others fell by the wayside. Being a Quidditch star and very pretty, she was the centre of the group, having a handful of friends accompany her even to the bathroom, and up until her sixth year she was never seen without them. At the welcoming feast in her sixth year, Cho chatted animatedly with her friends but later on she was mostly by herself or with Marietta.[8][6]  Dumbledore's Army, her friends and allies Cho became a member of Dumbledore's Army in 1995. It was an organisation led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge. Cho's relationship with the other members of the army is unknown, but it is possible that they were all friends. Some members of Ravenclaw, such as Michael Corner, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Padma Patil, and Luna Lovegood were members of the army, as well.  Other members were Zacharias Smith, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott and\nErnie Macmillan from Hufflepuff, and Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan, Fred and George Weasley, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil (Padma's twin), Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Colin and Dennis Creevey from Gryffindor. She may also have been friends with Katie Bell as the two girls were in the same year and were seen chatting to one another after the Battle of Hogwarts.  Cho was not fond of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger however; she did not trust Harry's closeness and friendship with Hermione, generally suspicious that Harry had feelings for her as well. This was one of the reasons that Cho and Harry fell apart. Ironically, Hermione was trying to give advice to Harry on building a successful relationship with Cho. As for Ron, he was tactless when Cho came to Harry, accusing her of being biased in supporting the Tutshill Tornados while being ignorant of her desire to talk to Harry alone. Naturally this did little to endear her to Ron. Furthermore, as Harry would discuss Cedric's death with both Ron and Hermione, while refusing to do the same with Cho, this only increased Cho's dislike of Harry's best friends.  Ginny Weasley seemed relatively neutral about Cho, (though for obvious reasons she was not supportive of her and Harry's relationship), mentioning to Harry out of suggestion that maybe he should talk to her about Marietta instead of the long periods of avoidance from his end.  When the entire DA ostracised Marietta for betraying them, Cho alone stood up for her, putting her at odds with the rest of the group. This did not, however, appear to prevent her from retaining membership with the DA, and she fought with Dumbledore's Army during the Battle of Hogwarts, most of them surviving the war.

However, this was almost certainly untrue as Percival's own wife was a Muggle-born witch. However, the Dumbledore family kept its secrets well, and Percival's reputation would remain tarnished even after the death of his 115-year-old son, Albus.[6]  Posthumanously after his death sometime in the 1890s, Percival become a grandfather to his youngest son, Aberforth's son, Aurelius Dumbledore, born after the young man's relationship with a girl from Godric's Hollow the summer of 1899.[3]  When Albus Dumbledore put on the Peverell Ring, with hopes that using the Resurrection Stone would allow him to see his loved ones once more, one of the people he hoped to see \u2014 and apologise to \u2014 was his father.[7]  As a relatively young wizard, Percival was described as \"a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle\",[8] like his son, Albus, who, in his own time at Hogwarts, exhibited many of\nthe same traits as his father.  Percival's wife, Kendra Percival's relationship with his wife during their marriage is unknown, but they shared a devotion to their children, particularly their youngest, Ariana. Percival attacked the three boys who assaulted their daughter, and Kendra devoted the remainder of her life to taking care of Ariana.[6]  Albus and Aberforth, his sons Percival's relationship with his sons is not very clear. Percival did not seem to be held in high regard by Albus, especially for being imprisoned in Azkaban for an attack on three Muggles, but years later, Dumbledore wished to use the Resurrection Stone to bring back his deceased family and apologise to them \u2014 even his father, showing that Albus nevertheless truly loved Percival despite all that happened. Like Albus, Aberforth may not have held his father in high regard either for his attack on the Muggles who attacked his sister, Ariana and being imprisoned in Azkaban.[6]  Percival's daughter, Ariana Percival loved his only daughter dearly and was greatly distraught by her assault. He attacked the Muggle boys who did it and was sent to Azkaban for it. He never explained to the Ministry his reasons, knowing that if they discovered Ariana Dumbledore's condition, she would be confined to St Mungo's as a threat to the Statute of Secrecy.[6]  Percival was a knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend.

She learned of her magical nature as a child, after Severus Snape recognised her as a witch and told her of the existence of magic. Lily attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971 to 1978. She was Sorted into Gryffindor House and was a member of the Slug Club. In her seventh year she was made Head Girl and began dating James Potter.  After Hogwarts, Lily married James. Along with their friends Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, the couple joined the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. She and her husband defied Lord Voldemort himself three times. Shortly afterwards, Lily and James had a son, Harry James Potter, of whom they made Sirius the godfather.   However, the family was forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Lord Voldemort and their infant son. It referred to a boy who would be born at the end of July in 1980, who had the power to defeat Lord Voldemort. She and James were betrayed by Pettigrew and were murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en night in 1981, while trying to protect their son.  Lily briefly appeared again through the Resurrection Stone to encourage Harry in his own sacrifice during the Battle of Hogwarts in May 1998. She appeared along with James, Sirius, and Remus. After the end of the Second Wizarding War, Lily had three grandchildren through her son: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter, the last of whom was named in memory of her.  Lily\nJ. Evans was born to Mr and Mrs Evans, two Muggles of the Evans family, on 30 January 1960. Her family lived in Cokeworth, England.[9] She had an older sister Petunia, whom she was quite close to. At the age of nine, Lily became friends with Severus Snape, who lived down in Spinner's End, which was within walking distance of the Evans' house. However, her family was apparently better off, since Petunia sneered at Snape for coming from that poverty-stricken neighbourhood.[3]  Snape telling Lily that she was a witch Severus was the first person to tell Lily that she was a witch, and he went on to teach Lily a great deal about the wizarding world while the two eagerly awaited the time when they could attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry together. Lily's magical abilities and friendship with Severus caused problems between the two sisters. Envying her sister's abilities, Petunia wrote to Albus Dumbledore, asking if she could attend Hogwarts with Lily. However, the headmaster kindly refused her petition. The letter was later found by Lily and Severus.[3]  At the age of eleven, Lily bought her wand from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. The wand was 10\u00bc inches, willow, \"swishy\", and according to Garrick Ollivander, good for charm work. Shortly before her depart to Hogwarts, Lily and Petunia argued about magic again. Her sister called her a \"freak\" for possess that power and said it was better that she went to that school so \"normal people\" would be safe", "PPL": 0.13172553479671478, "PPL/lower": 0.217657235818543, "PPL/zlib": 4.063094842588365e-05, "Min-5%": 2.565322870936464, "Min-10%": 1.3101818624463881, "Min-20%": 0.6581012405635002, "Min-30%": 0.4390253637513868, "Min-40%": 0.32930194109685235, "Min-50%": 0.2634254903120876, "Min-60%": 0.21967866799449431}, {"text": "duel. However, Dumbledore also understood that he had his weaknesses and blind spots just as any other man and worked hard to keep them in check.  Albus Dumbledore proving to a young Tom Riddle that the Headmaster was a wizard More than anything else, Dumbledore was motivated by his belief in the power of the human spirit. He also had a deep capacity for love, frequently reminding Harry that love was the greatest magic of all. Dumbledore believed in the good in everyone and insisted on giving second chances. He notably argued strongly against the expulsions of Newton Scamander, and later Rubeus Hagrid, as well as refraining from expelling Jacob's sibling, despite the latter repeatedly breaking school rules. Dumbledore also allowed Remus Lupin to be a pupil at his school and later a professor, despite the fact that Remus was a werewolf. He had a great friendship with Hagrid, despite many not trusting the half-Giant. The greatest example of this,\nhowever, is Dumbledore's relationship with Severus Snape, in whom Dumbledore was willing to hold a considerable amount of faith after Severus had shown remorse. Dumbledore even saw a possibility for good in Tom Riddle as a child, and was open to giving him a second chance, despite the fact that Tom had already revealed himself to be a cruel sociopath and bully even at a young age, though he kept a careful eye on Tom Riddle during his Hogwarts career rather than simply hoping for the best.   Although he was devoted to Riddle's defeat after he became Voldemort, Dumbledore was genuinely regretful on how the days he could have easily intimidated Riddle into admitting his wrongdoings and taking responsibility for them were long gone, proving he felt a level of remorse for never managing to do anything significant to change Riddle. In addition, Dumbledore also believed the rumours of Grindelwald showing remorse for his crimes during his time in prison and showed a level of respect and gratitude for Grindelwald's concealment of the true location of the Elder Wand for a shred of redemption even if it was in vain.  Albus Dumbledore in thought Dumbledore was highly perceptive and psychologically canny; his knowledge of people's true personality went beyond being simply a good judge of character. This was never more apparent than in his complex insights into Voldemort's psyche, which he pieced together with Harry to deduce where the Horcruxes were hidden. However, this insight also made him extraordinarily good at manipulating people, which he was perfectly willing to do if he thought it necessary. Perhaps the most blatant example of this was with regard to Severus Snape, as he used Snape's love for the late Lily Evans to manipulate him into helping him protect Harry Potter, her son, despite all the risks it entailed and despite Snape's bitterness and hatred towards Harry's father. Another note worth mentioning in this area, is Dumbledore conjured a bottle of gin to help ease Mrs Cole during their conversation. He did not offer her a glass, but simply produced it, knowing she would drink it. A lesser note of his emotional insight was with Gilderoy Lockhart: despite Lockhart having fooled every inhabitant in the wizarding world with his books, Dumbledore, having knew what he truly was, was completely unable to be tricked by Lockhart and he was able to effortlessly manipulate Lockhart into taking the job of DADA Professor by slyly hinting Harry Potter was in Hogwarts attending his second year so he can expose him. He was also the only person ever encountered by the young Tom Riddle who the latter was not able to charm.  In spite of Dumbledore's many extraordinary qualities, he was also a somewhat Machiavellian figure.[106] He could be stoically pragmatic and was extremely prone to secrecy. He spent a short portion of his youth concocting plans with Gellert Grindelwald for global domination over Muggles, in the process treating his ill sister with neglect. Whilst Dumbledore was never a deliberately cruel man, at times, he was\ntoo far-sighted, making choices that he believed to be for the greater good and overall benefit of humanity even if it deeply hurt some of the people around him in the immediate short-term. For example, he placed Harry Potter with the Dursley family despite knowing that they would be unlikely to treat him well, as pointed out by Professor McGonagall, all for the sake of keeping him alive.  Dumbledore's greatest personality flaw, which he explained to Harry in 1998,[28] was his desire for power. Particularly in his younger days, he acknowledged that he had been quite selfish and that because of his extraordinary abilities, he had wanted fame, power, and glory for himself. When he and Gellert Grindelwald were in school, they made plans to enslave Muggles and re-establish wizards as the natural rulers of the world. However, when his sister Ariana Dumbledore was killed during a duel between himself, Aberforth Dumbledore, and Grindelwald, any desire to accomplish this goal left him. The incident led to him declining any attempts by others to offer him positions of great political authority, and he refused to take the post of Minister for Magic at least three times. Though he did accept the positions of Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, both of these were tempered by checks and balances from contemporaries and colleagues rather than positions of absolute power which could seduce him back into his old ways.   Dumbledore, while often kind and calm, did have a very serious side of himself and was capable of a terrifying wrath. This was rarely seen but appears to be well known and combined with his exceptional magical abilities, made very few of his allies willing to cross him and almost all of his enemies feared him, to the point that even Lord Voldemort and Gellert Grindelwald were known for fearing him, despite their own incredible magical powers, wrath and status as the two most dangerous Dark wizards in history. Even a slight exertion of Dumbledore's serious side and anger could intimidate the likes of Harry Potter, and even the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, evidenced when they both were shocked when Dumbledore made it clear quite firmly that Hagrid did not open the Chamber of Secrets, despite Dumbledore not openly showing anger. Additionally, rather than shouting when Harry entered Hogwarts with the Ford Anglia, and when Harry failed to get Slughorn's memory, just an expression of calm disappointment on both occasions was enough to make Harry feel ashamed to the point that he found it preferable if Dumbledore shouted at him. Additionally he was able to reduce Snape to ashamed and pitiful grovelling with a single sentence proclaiming his disgust at the former's willingness to let Lily Potter's husband and son die so he could have a chance at rekindling his relationship with her, speaking with a tone of contempt the likes of which Harry (when witnessing the memory of this encounter) had never heard nor thought him capable of.   At the apex of Dumbledore's wrath, which happened extremely\nrarely, such as when he apprehended Barty Crouch Jnr, who impersonated Moody and almost killed Harry, Dumbledore was described as \"being struck with cold, ancient fury\". In fact, during this rare moment of intense anger (caused by Dumbledore's realisation that, not only had Voldemort been resurrected, but also that he had been expertly deceived by the guise of a close and trusted friend for an entire year), Dumbledore was so terrifying that even Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape, both extremely powerful and stern wizards who rarely displayed emotions, were clearly uneasy. Harry himself (who was also rather terrified of his reaction) fully understood then why Dumbledore was the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. In addition to being completely unintimidated but rather saddened by Harry's profound bursts of rage regarding Sirius (though Dumbledore knew full well he completely deserved Harry's anger), in all the other times Harry unleashed his anger, Dumbledore proved himself capable of quelling even Harry's anger with just a slight exertion of his dark side, as he silenced Harry's questions regarding his judgement of Draco and Snape and even silenced Harry's anger with just indicating he had crossed the line, showing even Harry's rage could not match the seriousness and fury the old but extraordinarily powerful wizard was capable of. As a somewhat interesting side note, his displays of rage were virtually opposite in character to those", "PPL": 0.08989674597978592, "PPL/lower": 0.24239502676367822, "PPL/zlib": 2.4133354625445885e-05, "Min-5%": 1.7764294034637071, "Min-10%": 0.8959632778503731, "Min-20%": 0.4488038351994992, "Min-30%": 0.2993991119939347, "Min-40%": 0.2248711511853147, "Min-50%": 0.1798533524963768, "Min-60%": 0.14984429941482083}, {"text": "\" to Harry). From the hall, Dudley yelled that Harry had received another letter. Vernon wrestled Dudley to the ground and took the letter away, which was made difficult by Harry clinging on to Vernon's neck.[8]  The Dursleys and Harry reacting in surprise, as Hogwarts letters pelted from the chimney Within a week, 24 or more letters arrived for Harry; Dudley wondered who on Earth would want to talk to\nHarry so badly. When so many letters for Harry arrived, Vernon, having had enough, told the family to get ready to leave. Dudley angered his father when he dawdled, trying to pack his television, VCR and computer into his bag. By nightfall, Dudley was in an unpleasant mood; he was hungry, had missed five TV shows he wanted to watch and had not gone so long without shooting an alien on his computer. At the Railview Hotel, Dudley shared a room with Harry; while Harry remained awake, Dudley fell asleep almost immediately.[8]  Hagrid giving Dudley a pig's tail The following day, Vernon brought Dudley and the family to the Hut-on-the-Rock well out in the sea. Using some mouldy blankets, Petunia made Dudley a bed on the couch, which he was very unhappy with, while she and Vernon took the second bedroom and Harry was left on his own to find comfort.[8] At midnight, when Harry's birthday came, Dudley was jerked out of his sleep by a loud crashing outside the hut, and asked sleepily where the cannon was; a few moments later, the hut's door was knocked off by Rubeus Hagrid. Dudley remained on the couch, frozen in fear. When Hagrid nudged him out of the way, Dudley ran and hid behind his mother.[9]  When Vernon insulted Albus Dumbledore and after Hagrid informed him that Harry was going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid used magic to sprout a pig's tail from Dudley's bottom, which caused immense pain \u2014 something that Harry found enjoyment in.[9]  After dropping Harry off at King's Cross Station on 1 September, the Dursleys took Dudley to a private hospital in London to have the tail surgically removed before he went to Smeltings.[10] Over the course of the school year, he grew even more massive: so much so that his bottom drooped over each side of his chair.[11]  In June, Dudley accompanied his parents to King's Cross Station to pick Harry up for the summer holidays. In spite of his morbid weight, his clothes were curiously depicted as loose, as he had to hitch up his trousers \"which were slipping down his fat bottom\" during a conversation with Harry. One morning during breakfast, Dudley wanted more bacon. He asked Harry to pass the frying pan: when Harry said he forgot the magic word (meaning \"please\"), Dudley fell out of his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen.[11] Obviously, Dudley had been trained by his parents by that time to hate and fear anything that had anything at all to do with Harry and his world.  Dudley and his parents getting ready for the Masons in July 1992 On 31 July, Dudley taunted Harry about not receiving any birthday presents from his friends. When Harry pretended that he was going to set a bush on fire by saying pretend magic words, Dudley ran to his mother, frightened. That night, the Dursleys (sans Harry) hosted a dinner party for clients of Vernon's \u2014 the Masons. At eight o'clock, Dudley was by\nthe front door, waiting for Mr and Mrs Mason to arrive. He offered to take their coats and offered his arm to accompany Mrs Mason to the dining room a while later.[11]  In the early hours of the next morning, Dudley was dumbfounded when he and his parents witnessed Harry's escape with Fred, George, and Ron Weasley in their father's flying Ford Anglia.[12]  By the next summer, Dudley was even fatter. At some point, he complained about the walk between the living room and the kitchen, so his father installed a new TV in the kitchen as a welcome-home-for-the-summer present. Dudley sat at the TV all day, eating constantly. His face also gained a fat appearance and made him look like he had an unsightly double chin.[6]  Along with his parents and Harry, Dudley learned one day of an escaped convict named Sirius Black, who the newscasters warned was armed and dangerous. Vernon was constantly complaining about lack of security and punishment, stating that hanging was the only way to handle people like Black.[6]  Dudley witnessing Harry inflate Aunt Marge On 31 July, Dudley's Aunt Marge came to visit their house. When Marge arrived, Dudley waddled into the hall to greet her. Marge seized him in a one-armed hug and kissed him on the cheek. Harry, sure that Dudley only put up with this treatment because he was well paid for it, noticed a twenty-pound note clenched in his fat hand behind his back. When Marge was blown up by Harry because of her voracious veracity, Dudley showed almost no emotion and continued watching TV. It can be assumed that he was used to the odd things that happened whenever his cousin was around.[6]  Dudley and his gang By the summer of 1994, Dudley had grown so large that the school outfitters at Smeltings Academy did not stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore; he had reached roughly the size and weight of a baby killer whale. To rectify the situation, the school nurse forced a diet regime upon Dudley, which emptied his eating habits of all the things he enjoyed: fizzy drinks, cakes, chocolate bars, burgers, doughnuts, chips, etc. and replaced them with fruits and vegetables \u2014 things that Vernon called \"rabbit food.\"   Dudley was not pleased and threw numerous tantrums about it. To make Dudley feel better, Petunia insisted that the whole family follow the diet, as well: to raise Dudley's morale, she also tended to give him more to eat than Harry (who, unbeknownst to Dudley, kept a secret stash of food in his bedroom). When Vernon left the kitchen to collect the post, Dudley stole his grapefruit quarter.[13]  The Weasley family arriving in order to retrieve Harry for the World Cup The next day when the Weasleys arrived to take Harry to the Quidditch World Cup, Dudley nervously ran his hands over his backside: remembering the incident with Hagrid in 1991, he was unwilling to present the same target to wizards again.[13]  As the Weasleys returned to the Burrow\nthrough the Floo Network, Fred \"accidentally\" dropped numerous sweets in brightly coloured wrappers on the floor, knowing Dudley would eat one of them. The sweet revealed to be a Ton-Tongue Toffee, caused Dudley's tongue to expand greatly and cause him pain. Before allowing Mr Weasley to fix it, Petunia tried to rip the tongue out of Dudley's mouth, which nearly suffocated him. His tongue was more than four feet long before the Dursleys allowed Mr Weasley to shrink it.[13]  Dudley taking up boxing In 1995, Dudley took up boxing, which gave him even more prominence over other children. As a result, he lost weight and became less spoiled. However, he was still described as \"vast as ever\", but it was implied that his bulk was more muscle than fat because of the boxing. He would roam the streets with his gang, vandalising public property, taking up smoking and terrorising younger children. After taking up his workout regime, Dudley became boxing champion at his school.

After Lord Voldemort asked for a borrowed wand, Narcissa touched her husband's hand, when he showed fear at the sign of giving away his only weapon and means of defence, resulting in her husband into agreeing to give his wand to Voldemort; it was soon broken in the Battle of the Seven Potters.[15]  Voldemort was still displeased with the Malfoys for Lucius's earlier failures and delighted in humiliating them by taunting their relation to werewolf Remus Lupin through Narcissa's niece, Nymphadora Tonks.[15]  Narcissa with her son, Draco fighting off Harry Potter and Ron Weasley When Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Greyback, they were brought to Malfoy Manor. Narcissa acted coldly and disdainfully towards Scabior but let them in, where she called on her son to identify the prisoners and recognised Hermione from their encounter a year earlier in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.[10]  Narcissa clashed with her sister over who had authority in her home, and therefore over the prisoners held in her cellar: Harry, Ron, Dean Thomas, Griphook, Garrick Ollivander, and Luna Lovegood, the latter two of which had been held there for some time. All the prisoners escaped: Dean, Luna and Ollivander Disapparating with Dobby, while Harry and Ron went to save Hermione from Narcissa's sister, Bellatrix, who had used the Cruciatus Curse to brutally torture her with. Later, in the brief duel that followed, Narcissa was shocked to see her family's former house-elf, Dobby, openly defying them. He was eventually murdered by Bellatrix as the group escaped the manor.[10]  Narcissa is present and horrified when Voldemort murders goblins After Harry and his friends escaped to Shell Cottage, Lord Voldemort severely punished the Malfoy family, but did not act as harsh on Bellatrix.[32] By the time of the Battle of Hogwarts, Narcissa had given her son, Draco, her wand to use in lieu of his own stolen wand, leaving both herself and her husband without their original wands, although the two later obtained second wands by the time of the battle.[33] She was also present when Lord Voldemort interrogated and murdered goblins in a fit of anger after learning of Harry Potter's Gringotts break-in and theft of one of his Horcruxes.[34][11]  Towards the beginning of the battle, Draco lost his mother's wand in the Room of Requirement, leaving it to be incinerated by Vincent Crabbe's Fiendfyre.[33]  Narcissa checking if Harry is dead on Voldemort's orders During the final phase of the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort attempted to kill Harry Potter in the Forbidden Forest using the Killing Curse. Voldemort demanded that someone check to see if Harry was, in fact, dead, a deed no one wanted to perform. Perhaps seeing an opportunity to discover her son's current condition, Narcissa volunteered. Seeing that Harry was still alive, she used the opportunity to covertly ask\nHarry if he knew of Draco's well-being. In a whisper, she asked if Draco was alive. When Harry replied quietly that he was, Narcissa betrayed the Dark Lord and asserted that Harry was dead, which she most likely would not have done had Harry responded \"no\". However, at that moment she was willing to risk it all for her family. She knew the only way her family would be reunited was as part of Voldemort's conquering army, thus proving she loved her family more than she supported Voldemort, who by that point, witnessing the horrors he had brought upon her and her family, most likely wished death.[35]  Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War When the battle recommenced, Narcissa and Lucius abandoned the Death Eaters and searched frantically for Draco. The family was present for Bellatrix's death at the hands of Molly Weasley and for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, the family was reunited in the Great Hall, where they seemed uncomfortable with their predicament, but did not leave.[35]  However, as Narcissa betrayed Voldemort and left him, the entire Malfoy family was granted a reprieve and avoided incarceration in Azkaban.[16] Narcissa would eventually become a grandmother to Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco and his wife Astoria Greengrass.  A middle aged Narcissa Narcissa Malfoy was described to be the height of Harry Potter, slim, \"nice looking\", and very pale, with blue eyes, long blonde hair, and a clear, cold voice. She had thin white fingers.[30][6][7][8][3] Her hair colouring thus differed from most of the House of Black, who generally had dark hair, though Narcissa did possess the arrogant good looks that were a common characteristic of her family. Despite her physical differences to her sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda, Harry Potter did describe her as resembling Bellatrix somewhat, though Narcissa was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.  Narcissa's beauty was somewhat marred by her donning an expression that suggested that she was sniffing dung whenever she was in the company of those she considered her inferiors.[3] Harry Potter once insulted her son Draco by asking if she only had this expression when Draco was with her.[25]  Narcissa was a very proud woman who frequently displayed a haughty and disdainful attitude, looking down upon others as she believed strongly in the importance of blood purity and valued her family's wealth.[3][30] She was prejudiced towards Muggle-borns, other non-pure-bloods such as Fenrir Greyback,[10] and so-called \"blood traitors\".[30] For example, she once rudely exclaimed to the owner of Madam Malkin's that she would rather shop at Twilfitt and Tatting's instead since Madam Malkin's served \"scum\" such as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley.[30] Despite her beliefs and her family's close ties to Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, Narcissa never joined the organisation herself, nor received the Dark Mark.   While she treated most people coldly,[30] Narcissa was very loving towards her family as well as devoted to them.[4] She was\nwilling to do whatever it took to keep her son safe when he was put in danger during the Second Wizarding War, from begging Severus Snape to take an Unbreakable Vow to help him[4] to lying to Voldemort himself.[35] She cared deeply about her husband and son and displayed a fierce and protective temper on their behalf, as well as a ruthless determination to keep them safe.[4][35] She went as far as to risk her life for Draco's sake, by saying to Voldemort that Harry was dead, when had Harry responded with a negative response, she most likely would've told the truth, to keep herself safe. Her devotion to her son was such that she insisted on his attending Hogwarts instead of Durmstrang, despite the latter's reputation for blood purity amongst its students, solely for the sake of keeping him closer to home.[23]  Narcissa had a close relationship with her oldest sister Bellatrix despite their differing temperaments and personality traits.[4] Narcissa always despised the Blacks, but had great respect for those who did. The ones who dared to defy their family's beliefs, such as her older sister Andromeda and cousin Sirius Black, leading her to ignore and disown them.[15]  Narcissa and Draco duelling Harry and Ron at Malfoy Manor Narcissa's first wand Lucius Malfoy, her husband and father of her son Narcissa and her husband, Lucius Malfoy, were shown to have an affectionate and loving relationship.[4][15] He gave in to her wishes when she wanted their son to attend Hogwarts, rather than Durmstrang.[23] Lucius also allowed his wife to continue the Black Family naming custom of stars and constellations through their son, showing obvious respect for her family and deference to herself.

Griphook subdued it using the Clankers. Hearing pursuit approaching, Harry forced Bogrod to open the vault, which was filled with precious objects. Hermione screamed in pain, and they discovered that the vault's protective charms included the Flagrante and Gemino curses: the contents would multiply and become searing hot every time something was touched. Harry spotted Hufflepuff's Cup, the Horcrux, but it was out of reach. Hermione levitated Harry by the ankle and he snagged the cup by using Gryffindor's sword, as to not be burned by the metal. Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron, Griphook and Bogrod all struggled to stay above the searing-hot rapidly multiplying objects below.  The trio escaping Gringotts on the back of a half-blind Ukrainian Ironbelly As Harry was setting himself down, he dropped both the sword and the cup. Griphook grabbed the sword, and flipped Hufflepuff's cup up into the air. Harry caught it, ignoring the searing heat. Borne by a treasure avalanche spilling from the now-opened vault, Griphook ran off with Gryffindor's sword, yelling that thieves were in the vault. Harry, Hermione, and Ron hurled curses at the goblin throng. Harry released the half-blind dragon and the three jumped on its back. The freed dragon took flight, and the three blasting holes into the ceiling for it to fly through as they made their escape.  The trio Apparating into Hogsmeade before the start of the final battle A vision from Voldemort helped Harry realise that the third Horcrux, whilst unbeknownst to him at the time, Ravenclaw's Diadem, remained at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on their final mission to return to the school and obtain the diadem, inadvertently tripping the Caterwauling Charm upon Apparating to Hogsmeade and thereby alerting the waiting Death Eaters to their presence. Due to the trio being under the Invisibility Cloak, however, the Death Eaters resorted to unleashing Dementors into the streets to try to force the intruders out of hiding.  Having no choice, Harry conjured his Patronus to protect himself and his friends, automatically giving away their position and confirming their identities (the Death Eaters having been pre-warned that Harry Potter's Patronus took the form of a stag). As Death Eaters began to close in on the still invisible trio, Aberforth Dumbledore emerged from the Hog's Head, hurriedly telling the three to enter his pub. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione did so, Aberforth remained outside, proclaiming to the Death Eaters that it was he who tripped the alarm (by letting his cat out) and conjured the Patronus to ward off the Dementor threat; mockingly contradicting a Death Eater, saying that what he had seen was a goat Patronus rather than a stag. The incensed Death Eaters believed this and retreated.  D.A. members in the\nRoom of Requirement welcoming Harry back on 1 May After Aberforth re-entered his pub and home, he scolded them for coming to Hogsmeade advising them to leave the country. After Harry engaged in a brief and fierce argument with him, he led the grateful trio directly into Hogwarts through a secret entrance behind the portrait of his deceased sister, Ariana Dumbledore. Neville Longbottom (acting as their escort) then guided them into the Room of Requirement, where they were enthusiastically greeted by the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army; most of which were beaten and bruised, yet ready to fight the Death Eaters controlling the school. Harry tried to tell them that he, Ron, and Hermione only returned to find something, but Neville contacted other allies with a call to arms. Harry was initially reluctant to allow the others to help, as he had developed trust issues. But in an attempt to be a better man than Dumbledore (whom he feared he was turning into) and after some discussion with Ron and Hermione, he allowed it.  Harry and Luna entering Ravenclaw Tower Harry hesitantly asked the room at large if they had ever heard of any sort of legendary artefact belonging to one of the Founders of Hogwarts. Luna Lovegood then elaborated on the fabled Diadem of Ravenclaw, pronouncing that a statue in Ravenclaw Tower depicted Rowena Ravenclaw wearing a diadem. Harry, having no idea of what the diadem looked like, was led by Luna to the Ravenclaw Common Room to observe the statue. Here the pair were ambushed by Alecto Carrow who pressed her Dark Mark immediately upon noticing Harry, summoning Voldemort, before Luna stunned her from under the Invisibility Cloak. Amycus Carrow attempted to force his way through the common room door, designed only to open after the door-knocker's question was correctly answered, by seeking the help of Minerva McGonagall, who easily allowed him entry by solving the door's riddle herself; by that time, Harry had managed to rejoin Luna under the Invisibility Cloak.  Amycus (in fear of his master's wrath) suggested framing Alecto's apparently mistaken summoning of the former on the Ravenclaw students; as he did, he spontaneously devised a lie that made it seem as though the students had forced Alecto to touch her Dark Mark at wand-point. In her outrage, McGonagall strongly insinuated that Amycus was a coward for proposing such an idea and that she would not allow it. Carrow spat in McGonagall's face in retaliation, utterly enraging Harry who suddenly revealed himself while momentarily casting the Cruciatus Curse on the surprised Carrow. The curse sent Amycus flying backwards into the wall where he crumpled and fell unconscious. Harry then told McGonagall about the mission Dumbledore had left him, and she offered to hold Voldemort and his invading forces off, buying him the time he needed to search for the Horcrux. All students of age, the D.A., and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight prepared themselves for the impending siege. The Battle of Hogwarts began as Voldemort and his army approached\nthe outer boundaries of the school.  McGonagall, Mrs Weasley, and the suits of armour preparing for battle On 2 May, Lord Voldemort upon arrival at Hogwarts, demanded that the school turn over Harry, and the Battle of Hogwarts began. Harry realised that the positioning of Alecto Carrow in Ravenclaw Tower confirmed the Horcrux's identity. It was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. After thinking on it for some seconds, he went to ask the Grey Lady about the diadem. From her information, Harry surmised that the Horcrux had been hidden in the Room of Requirement. Harry, in the meantime, was worried about Hermione and Ron, who seemed to have disappeared. They had gone into the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup with basilisk fangs, which were one of the few weapons able to destroy Horcruxes.  The trio escaping from Fiendfyre that was cast by Vincent Crabbe The trio quickly headed for the Room of Requirement where Harry remembered seeing the Diadem the previous year. However, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle ambushed them. After a skirmish, the entire room was destroyed by the cursed fire Crabbe unleashed but could not control. Harry managed to fly himself and Malfoy out, while Ron and Hermione grabbed Goyle, but Crabbe perished in the flames that also destroyed the diadem. With one Horcrux remaining, Harry, Ron, and Hermione continued their pursuit of Nagini, but before they could go search for it, they witnessed the death of Fred Weasley. This incensed Ron and Harry, but Hermione reminded them that only they could finish Voldemort and that to obtain the final Horcrux they would have to do their share of fighting.   They fought their way to the Shrieking Shack. Along the way, Harry witnessed many scenes of horror. On the grounds, Voldemort's Dementors were waiting. After having seen so much pain and death, Harry could not summon the happiness required to conjure a Patronus. In fact, Harry almost welcomed the oblivion that would come with the Dementor's Kiss.

Lucius was present in for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort. Following Voldemort's defeat, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco sat in the Great Hall during the celebrations, looking unsure that they belonged there.[55]  Lucius and Draco's crimes were forgiven due to their abandonment of Voldemort and his cause, and Narcissa's lie to the Dark Lord that saved Harry Potter's life in the Forbidden Forest in\nthe Battle of Hogwarts. None of them served time in Azkaban due to the evidence he provided against fellow Death Eaters and his help to ensure the capture of many of Voldemort's followers who had fled into hiding.[15] However, the revelation of their previous loyalty to Voldemort had invariably destroyed Lucius's prized and precious reputation and few people would forget the Malfoy family's previous loyalties.   Lucius would eventually gain a grandson, Scorpius Malfoy, after Draco married Astoria Greengrass.[58] Because of Astoria's change of view regarding blood purity after the war, Lucius and Narcissa found her to be a somewhat disappointing daughter-in-law despite her pure-blood heritage.[30] According to Draco, Lucius was frequently telling Astoria that he wanted grandchildren to continue on the family line, despite Draco telling her otherwise.  Lucius still enjoyed collecting Dark artefacts, particularly ones that no one else had. Theodore Nott worked for him and they created a prototype for a new Time-Turner, having decided the ones created by the Ministry were unsuitable and, having been destroyed, unavailable. The prototype was hindered by the five minute rule, but they then found a way to create another Time-Turner which would enable Lucius to travel back in time years, as he had hoped. However, he never used it which led Draco to believe that he actually preferred a world without Voldemort. The Time-Turner he created was kept by Draco, and it was used to save Scorpius and his friend, Albus, who were trapped in the past.[59]  Lucius Malfoy in 1996 Lucius had a pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold pale grey eyes. He often carried a walking stick with a snake head that contained his wand.  As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm; this had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.  After spending a year in the wizarding prison of Azkaban, possibly suffering the horrors of the Dementors' presence, his looks suffered greatly because of it, his skin taking on a yellowish and waxy look, and his eyes sunken and shadowed. His voice was also quite hoarse. Later that year, after having been a victim of the Dark Lord's wrath upon Harry Potter's escape from the Manor, Lucius's looks took a turn for the worse, as he seemed ragged, and he carried traces of his punishment, meaning he might have looked beaten and bruised. It is likely that his looks might have improved upon the fall of his former Master once he returned to everyday life.  His son Draco resembled him strongly.[4] It was stated that his grandson, Scorpius Malfoy, resembled Draco, meaning that Lucius and his grandson also had a resemblance.  As pretty much the embodiment of wealth and influence in the wizarding community, Lucius Malfoy took great pride in his aristocratic stature, and viewed himself as superior to Muggles and Muggle-borns, although his views on half-bloods were likely more tempered as many half-bloods appear on the Malfoy family tree.[60] He was also a very shrewd, opportunistic social climber who was\ngood at controlling others, but behind his veneer of respectability, he treated people cruelly. He callously utilised eleven-year old Ginevra Weasley in an attempt to both discredit her father in the Ministry, and remove Albus Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. This attempt would have resulted in her death if Harry Potter had not intervened.[61]  Lucius's dangerous temper as he attempted to curse Harry Potter Lucius could be intelligent and manipulative when he needed to be, allowing him to gain respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals through his fortune and family name. He even had influence over Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. Lucius's constant donations to important establishments were actually nothing more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.  While putting much effort into maintaining an appearance of respectability, Lucius's slick demeanour did little to hide his self-serving nature. He had no qualms about appealing to whichever side would be more beneficial to his social advancement. He was never unconditionally loyal because he didn't want to be put in a negative light with people on either end. During the Quidditch World Cup, he anonymously participated in the lowly torturing of Muggles but fled when the Dark Mark was cast in the sky.   In fact, rather than going to find Lord Voldemort when he lost all his powers in the first place, he instead pretended to have seen the error of his ways and tried to ingratiate himself to the Ministry of Magic. He claimed that he was always alert for Voldemort's return but when Voldemort pointed out that he had fled from the Dark Mark, Lucius was instantly silenced. Despite this, he did attempt to go through with Voldemort's plan of using his old school diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, not realising that the diary contained a piece of his master's soul (although Lucius was more focused on ridding himself of an incriminating piece of Dark magic when the Ministry was conducting searches).  However, in spite of his ruthless and prejudiced nature, one of Lucius's more redeeming traits was that he was very loving and devoted towards his family, especially caring greatly for his wife and son. He and Narcissa were indulgent and protective of their only child, though Lucius also demonstrated that he had expectations for his son, in one instance berating him for being beaten academically by Hermione Granger. In the end, along with Narcissa, he demonstrated that his family was more important to him than serving Voldemort, especially after Voldemort lost both the respect and trust he once had from the Malfoys. Lucius's love for Draco and Narcissa also allowed him to overcome his more self-serving side as he charged straight into the thick of battle during the siege on Hogwarts in an attempt to find Draco, eventually locating him after Voldemort was finally defeated and the battle came to an end.  Despite his love for his son, Lucius became disappointed in Draco for losing his value in pure-blood supremacy\nafter the Second Wizarding War, and for marrying Astoria Greengrass, who underwent similar changes to Draco's. Father and son had an argument for Draco's willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him to preserve Astoria's frail body, showing that Lucius still maintained his belief in pure-blood supremacy over the well-being of a human being, and that the mistreatment he received from the Second Wizarding War did little to change his opportunistic and bigoted personality.   He even employed Theodore Nott to create a \"true\" Time-Turner, a dangerous device that would give him the potential to go back in time to avert Voldemort's demise. Yet due to the fact that he never used it, it shows Lucius remained inclined to the Dark side, as was seen by his creating and keeping such a dangerous and illegal device, and passing it on to his son. However, it can be also inferred that Lucius didn't have any intention at all to bring back his former master, as Draco later reflected that Lucius seemed to like a world without Voldemort.  Lucius, along with Dolohov, duelling Sirius Black and Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries Being one of Voldemort's inner circle and, up until the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, one of his most trusted and valued allies, Lucius was obviously a very powerful and experienced wizard.

Draco realised from this that if the broken one was repaired, the cabinets could act as a passageway into the school.[19]  Draco preparing to enter Borgin and Burkes, wanting to question Borgin During the summer break between his fifth and sixth year, Draco questioned Borgin, the owner of Borgin and Burkes, on repairing the cabinet and ordered him to keep the other one safe. As a proof of his allegiance to Lord Voldemort, Draco showed Borgin the Dark Mark now branded on his arm whilst threatening to set Fenrir Greyback to attack the shop-owner, should he disobey his commands. This meeting was also overheard by Harry, Hermione, and Ron, but while Harry started to suspect Draco of Death Eater activities, Ron and Hermione dismissed such possibilities, and believed Draco was merely bluffing, a choice that they would much later regret.[19]  In preparation for such a dangerous mission, Draco trained and improved his own skills, and became capable of blocking jinxes nonverbally. He also became accomplished at Occlumency through the training of his maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, and was able to perform the very difficult Protean Charm,[19] though he could not yet produce a corporeal Patronus.[20]  Draco standing in front of the broken Vanishing Cabinet In focus for his mission of fixing the Vanishing Cabinet, Draco experienced many visible changes in his life. He seemed to have lost interest in Quidditch, and allowed (and possibly paid) Harper to take over instead. He was also becoming more neglectful in his school-work, as he missed two Transfiguration homework assignments and received detention, as well as not attending to his prefect duties, which he would usually happily abuse as he did in the previous year. Another change was that he no longer trusted Snape and was willing to speak ill towards him point-blank, no respect.  Socially, Draco forced Crabbe and Goyle to assume the forms of other people with Polyjuice Potion, to help him keep watch outside the Room of Requirement, while refusing to tell them anything, and seemingly to distance himself from them. Draco also spent less time mocking Harry and his friends, despite the many opportunities. Even his physical appearance showed the stress, with greying skin, weight loss\nand bags under his eyes. Most of this frustrated Harry, who was unable to discover exactly what Draco was up to despite his persistence and effort.[19]  Draco beginning to feel the strain of life as a Death Eater Twice during the school year he feared he would be unable to repair the cabinet, and resorted to desperate assassination attempts, such as trying to smuggle in a cursed necklace and trying to send Dumbledore poisoned mead. Both these attempts failed and resulted in innocent people getting injured, though since they both survived Dumbledore was not forced to apprehend Draco. The stress began to affect Draco adversely, and he confessed his fears to Myrtle Warren, one of the school's ghosts. On one such occasion, Harry stumbled on him. Draco reacted by starting to cast the Cruciatus Curse, but Harry sliced his skin open with his wand right before he could complete the incantation. Draco was hospitalised and Harry was given detention by Snape for every Saturday until the end of term.[19]  Harry nearly killing Draco with one of Snape's spells Eventually, through copious amounts of work Draco managed to repair the Vanishing Cabinet and used it to let at least six Death Eaters into the castle: Corban Yaxley, Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Gibbon, Thorfinn Rowle, and the vicious werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Proceeding to the top of the Astronomy Tower, Draco was able to corner a significantly weaker Dumbledore, disarming the latter the same instant he had, unknown to Draco, bound Harry Potter with a Full Body-Bind Curse.[19] It was also at the moment when he disarmed Dumbledore that he unknowingly gained the allegiance of the Elder Wand, one of the three Deathly Hallows.[21]  However, when Draco was finally given the opportunity to kill Dumbledore, who had just expressed his willingness to protect Draco and his family were they to 'come over to the right side', he could not bring himself to commit murder; considering that they spent the few minutes of alone time to discuss how Draco smuggled his accomplices into the castle, Dumbledore concluded that Draco would find committing murder impossible. As predicted, Draco ultimately was unable to do it, instead lowering his wand. Snape, who had made an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to step in if Draco failed in his task, used the Killing Curse on the Headmaster. Snape then promptly led Draco out of the school grounds, presumably to safety, but really to get to a safe distance to disapparate to Lord Voldemort.[19]  Draco disarming Albus Dumbledore on top of the Astronomy Tower After the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Draco could no longer return to Hogwarts, as he was an accomplice, however reluctantly, in the revered Albus Dumbledore's murder, mainly by being the one who let Death Eaters penetrate the castle's walls. The official criminal status placed on him, alongside his fear of the Dark Lord's wrath, led him to seek refuge, along with his family, with Voldemort, in the hopes of satisfying his orders to prevent any more negative highlights.[19]  His abrupt departure from\nthe school left Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle surprisingly lonely, despite the two being hulking boys, as Harry described during Dumbledore's funeral.[19]  Draco ambiguously recognising Harry when he was brought to Lord Voldemort's headquarters by Snatchers Draco reluctantly participated in Death Eater activities before the beginning of the 1997\u20131998 school year. Due to Draco's helpful role in Dumbledore's death, Voldemort liberated Lucius from Azkaban. He witnessed the murder of Charity Burbage and tortured Thorfinn Rowle on Lord Voldemort's orders. Judging by later remarks made by Vincent Crabbe, it seems that the Malfoys had lost much of their influence in the Death Eater circles. This is due to Voldemort no longer holding Lucius in high esteem and shifting his favour to Draco's maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange and Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape.   When Thorfinn Rowle and Antonin Dolohov failed to capture Harry, Voldemort forced Draco to torture them via the Cruciatus Curse as punishment, with the threat of Voldemort's wrath if Draco failed to comply. Harry, who saw this scene via his mental link with Voldemort, was disgusted at what the Dark Lord was forcing the young Death Eater to commit.[21]  The trio escape Malfoy Manor with Dobby's help Draco attended his seventh year of Hogwarts that year. During the Easter holidays, Draco was seen at home in Malfoy Manor. He was called upon by his parents and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange to confirm the identities of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback, but Draco showed great hesitation in doing so. When Hermione lied to Bellatrix under torture about Godric Gryffindor's Sword, Draco was sent to fetch the goblin, Griphook, from the dungeons to get confirmation of the story, which he did by lying saying it was a fake, but the truth was it was the true sword. Later in the evening, the prisoners managed to escape, and Draco's wand was taken by Harry. Afterwards, Draco and his family were detained to the Manor by Lord Voldemort. Narcissa would lend Draco her wand; it was powerful, yet it didn't 'understand' him, as he had not won its loyalty.[21]  Draco with his parents during the second-half of the Battle of Hogwarts Later that same year, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco, along with Crabbe and Goyle, chose to remain in the school as their fellow Slytherins evacuated in order to bring Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort.

Bill and his five brothers \u2014 Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and Ron \u2014 as well as his younger sister, Ginny,[17] grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing, and simple maths by his mother.   The Weasley family was not wealthy compared to other wizarding families. Many other pure-blood families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"blood traitor\", pro-muggle beliefs and their lack of wealth.[18] They tried their best to make up for this with their love towards each other and for other people. It can be assumed that Bill had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did.  Bill arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September, 1982. Among his fellow first years were, presumably, the future Weird Sisters members Kirley Duke and Myron Wagtail. Sorted into Gryffindor House, Bill quickly proved himself an academically strong and popular student. His best subject was Defence Against the Dark Arts.  At some point, either shortly before or just after he began attending school, an older student by the name of Jacob was expelled for endangering the school in his search of the fabled Cursed Vaults, which was announced in the Daily Prophet and swiftly became the talk of the Weasley household, which made Bill sympathise with the hardships of their younger sibling, who began attending school in his third year and were met with much whispering of Jacob's plight.[19]  In the 1984\u20131985 school year, his third year, Bill somehow took all five elective subjects: Muggle Studies, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Arithmancy, and Study of Ancient Runes.[20] It is unknown how Bill managed to cope with such a work heavy school schedule.   During the same school year, Bill learned that Jacob's sibling had been involved in their own search for the Cursed Vaults, leading to them entering a locked room on the fifth floor along with some fellow first-years containing cursed ice, which, as word spread quickly at Hogwarts, soon became common knowledge among the students.  Bill practising duelling in the castle's courtyard By his fourth year, Bill had become very popular among the other students and was regarded by many, including Rowan Khanna, as one of the bravest and most gifted students of his year. Usually found practising\ndefensive spells in the Training Grounds, he was approached by Jacob's sibling, who asked him for help investigating the Cursed Vaults.[6]  To this, Bill heartily agreed, voicing the opinion that the cursed ice that had begun to spread throughout the school because someone had been meddling with one or more of said vaults, after all, were posing a threat to the entire school and he would gladly do whatever he could to help resolve the dire situation, expressing excitement at the prospect of his first \"curse-breaking adventure\".  In preparation for entering the vault, Bill taught Jacob's sibling the Fire-Making Spell, practised duelling and studied all known information about the vaults, including reviewing the old articles concerning Jacob and his expulsion. After these things were taken care of, Bill met up with the younger student to enter the vault, insisted that he was excited to finally have an opportunity to act as a Curse-Breaker as opposed to merely talking about becoming one.[19]  Once they entered the ice-covered outer hall leading into the vault itself, Bill marvelled at the complexity of magic required to build such a place. Finding their path blocked by massive blocks of cursed ice reaching all the way up to the high, arching ceiling. The pair had to get past these obstacles, which Jacob's sibling speculated might be additional defences put in place to prevent people from reaching the vault, by working together to melt them down with flames from their wands. Once they reached the door, however, Bill, mindful of the details he had received of what happened to Rowan, insisted they would have to \"attack the door before it had a chance to attack them\".[21]  Trying to force their way through the door the same way they had done to break through the cursed ice, Bill was caught off guard when it countered the flames and shot a jet of icy light at him without warning, encasing him in a block of cursed ice and restraining his arms and feet. Jacob's sibling was concerned that they might accidentally hurt Bill if they tried to melt the ice surrounding him. First meaning to run for help, the aforementioned individual finally made their best effort to carefully cast the Fire-Making Spell on the ice, freeing him. Bill informed them of how, while he had suffered no physical injury, it felt as if the cursed ice had somehow drained him of energy, and Jacob's sibling agreed it would be best to simply leave.  Although he spent some time recovering from his injuries at the Hospital Wing, Bill was quick to dismiss the concerns of Jacob's sibling, telling them how he had never felt as alive before as when the two had tried to break into the vault, eager to give it another try, though wisely suggesting they brought some more people into their second attempt, to which Jacob's sibling voiced their intention of enlisting the aid of Rowan, Ben Copper and Penny Haywood, all of whom Bill urged his fellow pupil to arm with the knowledge\nand skills necessary to use the Fire-Making Spell as well, and Jacob's sibling also got the idea of helping Ben make some Burn-Healing Paste, prompting Jacob's sibling to take the nervously inclined Gryffindor in the Potions Classroom.[22]  Professor McGonagall got furious at Bill for teaching the Charm to Ben and Penny, causing Bill to worry that he might not be appointed Prefect later.[23]  Bill at a Prefect convention In the 1986\u20131987 school year, Bill became a Prefect,[24] and helped Jacob's sibling, who was helping Rubeus Hagrid, find Fang in the Hogwarts Library.[25] He had a crush on Emily Tyler and sought advice on romance from Jacob's sibling but after learning of Emily Tyler's true personality, his crush quickly dissolved.[26] He obtained twelve O.W.Ls.[15]  In the 1987-1988 school year, Emily Tyler asked out Bill before the Celestial Ball, but as he was no longer interested in her, he rejected her offer, instead opting to attend the Celestial Ball on his own.  In the 1988\u20131989 school year, Bill was made Head Boy.[17] At some point, Bill had a pen-friend at Castelobruxo, the wizarding school in Brazil. When his pen-friend wanted him to go on an exchange trip, Bill had to decline because his parents could not afford it. His pen-friend was offended and sent him a cursed hat that made his ears shrivel up.[27]  At some time prior to his graduation, Bill was given a \"Medal for Magical Merit\".[28]  Bill in front of Gringotts, shortly after being accepted for a job there After graduating from Hogwarts, Bill ultimately managed to live up to his life-long aspirations of joining the Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Having successfully found an opening for Curse-Breakers, applied and been accepted, Bill threw himself into his work, pouring all of his energies into his curse-breaking missions not to think too much about the betrayal of Patricia Rakepick at the end of his final term at school.   Frequently concerned about the well-being of his friends back at school, not to mention that of his younger brothers Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, who were all attending Hogwarts at the time, he eventually contacted Albus Dumbledore expressing his concern of the news he had received telling him about the apparent ineffectiveness of Rakepick's successor as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.[29]  Bill teaching supplementary evening classes He asked if he might be granted permission to visit the school whenever he had down time in between his missions in order to offer supplementary evening classes on the subject in order to help pupils learn how to defend themselves should Rakepick or other members of R to breach the security of the castle once more. Wholeheartedly agreeing, not only did the Hogwarts Headmaster permit him to visit the school on a regular basis throughout the 1989\u20131990 school year and 1990\u20131991 school year, he even gave him free access to", "PPL": 0.14913389086723328, "PPL/lower": 0.29330462164482596, "PPL/zlib": 4.013290927535879e-05, "Min-5%": 2.8613827582083498, "Min-10%": 1.4797688832360447, "Min-20%": 0.7439794358603821, "Min-30%": 0.4965445792297939, "Min-40%": 0.3730034184575816, "Min-50%": 0.29835717217025565, "Min-60%": 0.24858204027454422}, {"text": "of Muggle Artefacts Office.  In 1996, he was promoted to head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects by the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. When the Second Wizarding War began, Arthur joined the Order. While guarding the Department of Mysteries, he was attacked by Lord Voldemort's pet snake Nagini, but he made a full recovery. Arthur participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters (1997) and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), in which he suffered the devastating loss of his son Fred; however, he survived the war.  After the war, he saw his family expand even further with the addition of twelve grandchildren, through the marriage of many of his surviving children and eventually named Head of Department.[12]  Arthur Weasley was born on 6 February[1] 1950[2] to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (n\u00e9e Black).[14] His mother was disowned for marrying a \"blood traitor,\" as her family believed strongly in the notion of pure-blood supremacy. Arthur had two brothers.[15]  He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. In his third year in 1963, he may have chosen to take Muggle Studies, due to his interest in Muggles. While at school, he met and began dating fellow Gryffindor Molly Prewett. Arthur got caught out of bed by the school caretaker Apollyon Pringle after he and Molly went for a night-time stroll one evening and was severely punished.[16]  The Burrow, located on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur and Molly married. Their marriage was rather rushed, as Lord Voldemort was gaining power during that time and the First Wizarding War began.[17] Arthur was not a member of the first Order of the Phoenix. It is unknown if he was otherwise involved in the war, although he was familiar with the Death Eaters' use of the Imperius Curse and the trouble it caused the Ministry of Magic at the time.[18] During the course of the war, he and Molly had seven children: Bill in late 1970, Charlie in 1972, Percy in 1976, twins Fred and George in 1978, Ron in 1980, and the first daughter to be born into the Weasley family in generations, Ginny, in 1981.  The war ended soon after Ginny's birth, but not before Arthur's brothers-in-law Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both Order members, were killed by Death Eaters.[19] Arthur was upset when some Death Eaters, such as Lucius Malfoy, were able to escape punishment by claiming that they had been under the Imperius Curse. Arthur believed they were lying, and he and Lucius were hostile towards one another whenever they crossed paths.  At some point between his graduation from Hogwarts and 1992, Arthur gained employment in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic. He also purchased a Muggle car, a Ford Anglia, and bewitched it to\nmake it fly; in order to do so, he made sure to include a loophole in a law he wrote for the Ministry: as long as he was not intending to fly the car, it would be legal. The car was part of Arthur's substantial personal collection of Muggle artefacts, which he kept in a shed and included plugs and batteries.[20]  At one point in either 1985 or 1986, Arthur walked in on his twin sons attempting to make an Unbreakable Vow with five-year old Ronald and, in Ron's own words, \"went mental\". Precisely what happened was never elaborated on, but it was the only time Arthur was ever seen to have been as angry as his wife and it left Fred feeling \"his left buttock has never been the same\" for years afterwards.   Arthur and Molly visited Hogwarts on at least two Christmases in the 1980s, when Charlie was attending Hogwarts. During these visits, Arthur met Jacob's sibling.[21][22]  Arthur greeting his family after returning from work In 1992, Ron, Fred, and George borrowed their father's car to rescue Harry Potter from Privet Drive, after not receiving letters from him all summer.  When Arthur returned to the Burrow after a night of Ministry raids, he was pleased to find out the car could indeed fly. That was until he caught his wife's eye; he then poorly reprimanded the boys for doing so. When asked if he had found anything during the raids, he responded that they had only found a bunch of shrinking door-keys and a biting kettle. He was also introduced to Harry Potter and asked him about rubber ducks, due to his fascination with muggles.[20]  Arthur's confrontation with Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts A few days later, the family, as well as Harry, went to Diagon Alley to purchase school supplies for the upcoming year. While there, they visited Flourish and Blotts, where Gilderoy Lockhart was having a book signing event, during which Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy over Arthur's support for Muggles. He was very excited to meet Hermione Granger's parents, both Muggle dentists, insisting on taking them out for a drink.[20]  When Harry and Ron were prevented from getting on Platform 9\u00be, the pair borrowed the Ford Anglia to fly to Hogwarts. As this was a serious potential breach of the Statute of Secrecy, Mr Weasley faced an inquiry at work over the incident.[20]  In the spring of 1993, Arthur and Molly were called to Hogwarts when it was learned the Monster of Slytherin had taken their daughter, Ginny, into the Chamber of Secrets. It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had planted an old school diary of Tom Riddle's on Ginny, which subsequently possessed her and forced her to open the Chamber. Ginny was nearly killed, but was saved by Harry Potter and her brother Ron.[20]  The Weasley family in Egypt Arthur won some money in a Daily Prophet drawing and he and his family travelled to Egypt to visit his son Bill. In\nautumn of the same year, when Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban and was believed to be seeking Harry's death, Arthur wanted to tell Harry the truth. He discussed the matter with his wife in secret, not wanting Harry to panic. Harry, however, overheard their conversation. On Platform 9\u00be, Arthur and Harry briefly discussed what Harry had heard; while pleased that Harry was not scared, Arthur urged Harry not to go seeking Black.[23]  Weasleys, Diggorys, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger in Dartmoor In the summer of 1994, Arthur managed to get himself and his family (as well as Harry and Hermione) tickets for the Quidditch World Cup from Ludo Bagman because Arthur had helped Otto, Ludo's brother, out of a minor scrape. Arthur was among the Weasleys who fetched Harry from the Dursleys via the Floo Network. While there, he expressed his fascination at various Muggle artefacts in the Dursley's house. The group sat in the Top Box, where they were confronted by the Malfoys, who were there by a personal invitation from the Minister himself, though both Arthur and Lucius were able to restrain themselves out of respect for Fudge.[16]  A little while after the Weasleys, along with Harry and Hermione, had returned to their tents, a group of masked Death Eaters began storming the camp-site, jinxing the camp-site manager's family and anything or anyone that got in their way. Arthur, along with Percy, Charlie, and Bill, went out to combat them. Before he left, he told Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione to seek refuge in the woods, and that he would find them when it was safe.[16]  Reappearance of the Dark Mark over the campsite of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Upon seeing the Dark Mark in the sky, Arthur, along with other Ministry officials, Apparated at once to the location from where the mark had been cast.

Bill also had several nieces and nephews through his siblings; Molly and Lucy, Percy's children; Fred and Roxanne, George's children; Rose and Hugo, Ron's children; James, Albus and Lily, Ginny's children. He possibly had a good relationship with them, too.  The original Order of the Phoenix Bill became a member of the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, after Voldemort's return. He had a good relationship with the most fellow members. He seemed to like Albus Dumbledore, who was his headmaster at the time Bill attended Hogwarts. Bill was loyal to Dumbledore, and fought for him at the Second Wizarding War, after Dumbledore's death.  He seemed to be a friend of Remus Lupin, as they fought together in several battles of the Second War. After the Battle of the Seven Potters, they both left the Burrow in order to search for Mad-Eye Moody's dead body. When Lupin was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts, his body was put near Fred's. It is possible that Bill cried for Lupin, too.  He was also friendly with Alastor Moody. In 1997, Moody was the leader of a group that escorted Harry Potter to a safe place. However, Moody was killed. Bill, along with Fleur, was the one to witness his friend's death by Lord Voldemort and tell about it to the others, as well.  Bill also appeared to be on good terms with Nymphadora Tonks. Bill and Tonks fought together in many battles and were close in age; Bill was also one of the first to learn about her childbirth.  He was also friendly with Kingsley Shacklebolt. They fought\ntogether at many battles, such as the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. They both survived the war; Kingsley became Minister for Magic.  Minerva McGonagall appeared to be on good terms with Bill's family. She was Bill's head of house and Transfiguration professor. They both participated at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and, after the battle, she visited Bill at the hospital, and they discussed Dumbledore and Snape.  It was stated by Ginny Weasley that Bill did not like Severus Snape. After Snape killed Albus Dumbledore, Bill was angry with Snape; however, he learned that Snape was on their side and that Dumbledore had asked Snape to kill him. It is unknown how he reacted.  Though most members of the Order of the Phoenix were killed by Death Eaters. Bill and most of his family were among the few others who managed to survive.

He was a staunch believer in the equality of all magical and Muggle folk and was the head of the Weasley family.  Arthur was born to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (n\u00e9e Black) and had two brothers. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. Soon after graduating, Arthur married Molly Prewett. During the First Wizarding War, he and Molly had seven children: sons Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and Ron, as well as their daughter Ginny. He was not a member of the Order of the Phoenix during this period, and it is unknown if he participated in\nany way in the First Wizarding War.

He was also a friend of Horace Slughorn. It is unknown if Lucius's mother died, but it is possible that she was not alive during the Second Wizarding War.  Narcissa Malfoy, his wife Lucius and his wife, Narcissa, appeared to have a close and affectionate relationship. They both enjoyed being members of the social elite of the wizarding world and spoiling their only child, Draco. Lucius acquiesced to his wife's wishes when she wanted their son to attend Hogwarts, rather than Durmstrang. Narcissa was very upset when her husband was briefly imprisoned in Azkaban and became highly defensive when others mentioned it.[54] In 1997, when Lord Voldemort took over Malfoy Manor and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, he looked to Narcissa, and only when she touched his wrist, which gestured him to be calm, then he turned it over.[55]  Draco Malfoy, his son and only child While both Lucius and Narcissa spoiled their son, Lucius was the more demanding parent. Regardless, he spoiled Draco with everything from unlimited freedom to money, and personally purchased broomsticks for the entire Slytherin Quidditch team when Draco was made Seeker. He was also openly critical of Draco's school marks being lower than those of Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born witch, reproving Draco for his lack of effort to show her up. Draco looked up to his father, often boasting about his influence and emulating him.[61] He was furious with Harry Potter after the\nBattle of the Department of Mysteries, blaming him for getting Lucius incarcerated.[1]  Draco was terrified that his parents would be punished for his failure to assassinate Albus Dumbledore on Lord Voldemort's orders, and appeared to be close to accepting Dumbledore's offer to keep them safe before Severus Snape interceded and killed the Headmaster.[54] Lucius also cared far more about Draco than about his life as a Death Eater, as he was begging Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts to allow him to go search for Draco. Once it resumed, neither Lucius nor Narcissa fought at all, but instead went desperately searching for their son.[55]  In 2006, Lucius had a grandson, Scorpius through Draco and his wife, Astoria Greengrass. Lucius didn't think highly of Astoria, as she raised their grandson Scorpius with a more tolerant view on Muggles.[30] It is unknown what kind of relationship Lucius and Scorpius had, given Astoria's nurturing. Scorpius also resembled Lucius physically, as he resembled Draco, too. However, Lucius's relationship with Draco seemed to have been slightly more strained since Astoria's marriage into the family, as Draco made it clear he was willing to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him in order to preserve the health of his wife's frail body, to which Lucius protested.[59]  Arthur Weasley, his arch-rival Lucius and Arthur Weasley despised each other, often exchanging insults when they met, and even getting into a fistfight on at least one occasion. Lucius disdained the Weasley family for its poverty and so-called blood traitor status; while the Malfoys prized their pure-blood heritage, the Weasleys accepted Muggles and Muggle-borns. He and Arthur apparently clashed multiple times over this at the Ministry of Magic.   When Arthur proposed the Muggle Protection Act in 1992, Lucius was furious to the point of trying to sabotage Arthur by placing an old diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle's on Arthur's eleven-year-old daughter, Ginny, endangering her life as well as those of Muggle-born Hogwarts students, as this led to the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.[61]  Also, Arthur never believed Lucius's claim that he had been under the Imperius Curse during the First Wizarding War, thereby indicating that their enmity likely dates back to their younger years.  Severus Snape, his friend Lucius was the first person in Hogwarts who offered kindness to Severus Snape and later took him on as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 during their Hogwarts days. Lucius welcomed him into Slytherin House when Severus was sorted there and Lucius was a prefect, and as part of a group of future Death Eaters.[3] It is also possible that Lucius protected him from bullies, such as James Potter and Sirius Black, as the latter seemed to despise him. Lucius continued to think and speak highly of Severus later in life, and Severus seemed to favour Draco as a student in his Potions class, leading Sirius Black to once acidly comment that Severus was Lucius's lapdog.[66]  The fact that Narcissa Malfoy went to Severus for help when Lucius was in Azkaban and Draco had been given a dangerous mission\nby Voldemort[54] demonstrated the trust and respect the Malfoys had for Severus. Severus, on his part, was the only Death Eater who continued to treat Lucius kindly after his fall from favour and was the one who convinced Voldemort to free him from Azkaban. It is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learnt of Snape's death and his true loyalties to Dumbledore, though it is possible that he was saddened by the death of his old friend and may have been sympathetic towards Snape due to his own disillusionment from the Death Eaters.  Bellatrix Lestrange, his sister-in-law Lucius did not seem to have very much respect for Bellatrix Lestrange, his sister-in-law, as the rest of the Death Eaters did. Bellatrix was a fanatically loyal Death Eater, who also fought for Lord Voldemort in the First and the Second Wizarding War. Lucius was antagonistic with Bellatrix due to usurping his place within the Death Eater ranks despite the fact she had been imprisoned in Azkaban for fourteen years, unlike Lucius. Their differences in loyalty in the Dark Lord also fuelled their antagonism for each other.  When Bellatrix wanted to kill Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lucius restrained her. After the battle, Bellatrix told Narcissa that it was Lucius's fault that she couldn't give Voldemort the Prophecy. When Draco was made a Death Eater, she trained Draco herself In 1997, Bellatrix stayed with Lucius at his house, as she wanted to come closer to Voldemort, who was also staying there. Bellatrix and Lucius also fought together during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, where they argued about who would call Voldemort when they caught Harry Potter. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix was eventually killed by Molly Weasley, although Lucius's reaction to her death is unknown.   Dobby, his former House-elf who he treated abusively Dobby was Lucius's house-elf. Lucius treated Dobby with cruelty and abuse and was very sadistic with him. Dobby feared Lucius, but did everything Lucius ordered him. In 1993, Harry Potter freed Dobby by making Lucius give him a sock. Lucius became very angry and attempted to kill Harry. The last time Lucius saw Dobby was in 1998, when Dobby came to Malfoy Manor to rescue Harry Potter and his friends. Dobby was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, and it is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learned about his death.   Lord Voldemort, his former master Lucius was one of Lord Voldemort's most trusted and high-ranking Death Eaters, serving him in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Voldemort gave his diary Horcrux to Lucius to retain. Upon his rebirth in 1995, Voldemort questioned Lucius's loyalty, since he had never tried to find the Dark Lord after his fall in 1981.[53] Voldemort accepted Lucius's explanations and exultations of devotion, and entrusted Lucius with the task of obtaining a prophecy concerning him and Harry Potter.   Later however, Lucius selfishly throwing away the diary Horcrux, his failure in retrieving the Prophecy, and subsequent imprisonment in Azkaban made him and his family\nlose any favour in Vol", "PPL": 0.11067258566617966, "PPL/lower": 0.27851777443226466, "PPL/zlib": 3.449893568147745e-05, "Min-5%": 2.1818804358150445, "Min-10%": 1.1048977439583956, "Min-20%": 0.5530372465013419, "Min-30%": 0.36874366616813165, "Min-40%": 0.27688285268315604, "Min-50%": 0.22143175381872962, "Min-60%": 0.18447846502161241}, {"text": ", after him and Dudley Dursley were attacked by a Dementor in Little Whinging.  Before returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed prefects for Gryffindor house, to the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position very seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though she was not as intense about S.P.E.W. as she had been the previous year.   The trio and Neville meet Luna Lovegood for the first time She learned how to knit socks and hats for the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick the house-elves into\naccidentally freeing themselves. The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped cleaning the Tower at all. Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made, and cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know.   Hermione was challenged in more ways than one that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione. However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.[31]  Hermione practising with Dumbledore's Army in the Room of Requirement Meanwhile, it was not long before Hermione realised that the Ministry of Magic had decided to interfere at Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a cruel, falsely sweet Ministry employee with a personality like \"poisoned honey\", was appointed as the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts and Hermione, like Harry and Ron, disliked Umbridge for many reasons, one of which being that she refused to teach students practical defence, focusing only on theory, despite their OWLs being later that year.   With this being the case, Hermione decided that Hogwarts needed a competent teacher and, together with Harry and Ron, founded Dumbledore's Army, a secret organisation in which students would gather after classes and be taught practical defensive spells. She suggested that Harry be the teacher; though he originally thought the idea ridiculous, he consented to teach the class. The name was suggested by Ginny, who recalled the conversation they'd had about Fudge's greatest fear being that Dumbledore would form an army of students if the Ministry did not intervene at Hogwarts.  Hermione conjuring her otter Patronus One of the many advanced spells Hermione learned was the Patronus Charm; hers took the corporeal form of an otter.[23] Hermione became one of the few people brave enough to call Voldemort by his actual name. However, Hermione made the mistake of arranging the first meeting to take place in the Hog's Head, as opposed to the Three Broomsticks, which Sirius, appearing in the Gryffindor Common Room fire, said would have made it a lot harder for anyone to overhear. Willy Widdershins, who was in the Hog's Head, went to Umbridge, who instituted Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four to forbid any type of students groups from being formed under her watchful eye.  The trio and Ginny in St Mungo's after visiting Arthur Weasley Halfway through the year at Hogwarts, Harry had a vision of Voldemort's snake, Nagini, biting Mr Weasley during his task for the Order of the Phoenix. Mr Weasley was carried into St Mungo's Hospital, where Mrs Weasley screamed at him for trying to stitch his wound instead of healing it with magic.   Hermione was one of the few who visited him and stayed at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place for a couple of weeks until Mr Weasley was nursed back to health. Hermione had managed to convince her parents by telling them that skiing wasn't really her thing and that people who were serious about their exams stayed at Hogwarts and studied.  The trio in the Gryffindor common\nroom having a discussion about recent events The D.A. brought Harry into greater contact with Cho Chang. After a meeting, Harry kissed Cho, and when he returned to the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione immediately guessed, asking if Cho had cornered him after the meeting. When Harry told them that Cho has been crying, she explained to Harry and Ron that Cho was having a hard time since Cedric Diggory, who she used to go out with, was killed by Lord Voldemort. Hermione later gave Harry advice on Cho and girls in general.   In an effort to combat the lies being told about Harry, Hermione arranged for an interview during a Hogsmeade visit with Rita Skeeter to be printed in The Quibbler telling his side of the story, blackmailing Skeeter into penning it in a sympathetic tone. Despite being banned \u2014 or maybe because it was banned \u2014 it became the magazine's best-selling issue of all time.[31]  It was Hermione's brilliant spell-work that ensured the security of Dumbledore's Army. She created coins enchanted with the Protean Charm, an advanced spell, as a method of communication, and jinxed the club's attendance sheet to give any tattler a horrendous rash on the face, which would spell out \"SNEAK\" in painful boils. This is exactly what happened to Marietta Edgecombe, a reluctant member of the D.A., having been brought to the meetings by Cho. Shortly before Easter, Marietta finally caved under the pressure from her ministry mother who worked in the the Floo Network Office and betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge. When Harry learned that they could not find a counter-curse to heal her face, he swelled with pride at Hermione's jinxing ability.  Hermione and Neville Longbottom being held against their will by the Inquisitorial Squad Dobby the house-elf learned of this turn of events and rushed to the Room of Requirement to warn Harry and the D.A. They immediately scattered, and most members escaped, but Harry was caught by Umbridge and several Slytherin students who were members of the Inquisitorial Squad. A search of the room uncovered the parchment that each member of the D.A. had signed, headed Dumbledore's Army. Finally having \"proof\" that Dumbledore was building an army to challenge the Ministry, Umbridge immediately contacted Cornelius Fudge. Dumbledore fled the school and Umbridge became Headmistress. Hermione was not exposed at that time, but later she was brought to Umbridge's office by the some members of the Inquisitorial Squad.  Late in the fall of that year, Hagrid, who had been missing for the entirety of the school year, returned to Hogwarts. Hermione, Harry, and Ron ventured down to see him immediately even though it was after curfew. Hermione was aghast at the injuries Hagrid had sustained and greatly curious as to his story. Hagrid told the trio about his mission with Madame Maxime to try and recruit the giants in the fight against Voldemort. They were almost caught when Umbridge called on Hagrid that night, but hid under the Invisibilty Cloak.   Hermione forcefully telling Grawp to put her\ndown Months later, Hermione and Harry learned why Hagrid was perpetually bruised and cut; he had brought his giant half-brother Grawp back to Hogwarts, as he was getting severely bullied, and was trying to teach him human ways. After Grawp, who had the mental age of a human toddler, picked her up, Hermione forcefully told him to put him down. He subsequently became enamoured with Hermione, calling her \"Hermy\". It was one of the few words he could pronounce.   Just after their class took their O.W.L.s, Harry had a vision of his godfather being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Hermione was worried that it was a trap and convinced Harry to try to contact Sirius before doing anything rash. To that end, she accompanied Harry in an act of solidarity as he sneaked into Umbridge's office to use the Floo Network, with the assistance of Ron, Ginny, and Luna Lovegood, but they were ultimately caught. When Umbridge threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry during questioning, Hermione interceded. She came up with a lie that she and her fellow D.A. members had been building a weapon for Dumbledore, thus stopping Umbridge's sadistic interrogation and attempted torture of Harry.

Hermione dodged a Killing Curse and managed to stun Goyle, and then she and Ron dragged him out of the room on a broomstick as it went up in flames due to Crabbe's cursed Fiendfyre, which also destroyed the Horcrux. Harry rescued Draco, but Crabbe was killed by his creation.   Harry, Hermione and Ron then witnessed the death of Fred Weasley, which devastated them all. Despite their grief, the trio continued with the effort to track down Nagini, the last Horcrux (that they knew of). On their way, Hermione incapacitated two Death Eaters who were pursuing her, Harry and Ron, and blasted Fenrir Greyback away from an injured Lavender Brown. Lavender unfortunately still tragically died afterwards from her injuries.  The trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences, but Luna, Ernie Macmillan, and Seamus Finnigan came to their assistance. Under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, the three made their way to the Shrieking Shack, where they witnessed Voldemort have Nagini kill Severus Snape, as he had (ultimately incorrectly) assumed that the Elder Wand's loyalty lay with Snape.  During the brief pause in fighting, when Voldemort issued an ultimatum to Harry, Hermione comforted Ginny Weasley over Fred's death. When Voldemort and his army approached with a supposedly dead Harry, Hermione screamed in horror and denial.  Hermione witnessing Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort The Battle of Hogwarts soon resumed, and Hermione fought Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Ginny and Luna, despite being hindered by using Bellatrix's own wand against her. When Bellatrix nearly killed Ginny, Molly Weasley took over the fight and killed Bellatrix. Hermione witnessed Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, and she and Ron reached him first, overjoyed. Hermione survived the battle relatively unscathed, only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from\nentering the Lestranges' Vault shortly before the battle.[10]  At some point, Hermione found her parents in Australia and restored their memories. In 1998, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to attain her N.E.W.T.s.[36] She was the only one of the trio to do this, as Harry and Ron opted to join the Auror department and help round up remaining Death Eaters. By returning to Hogwarts she demonstrated how important schooling was to her.  At some point between 2010 and 2011, Hermione travelled to Diagon Alley, where she accidentally bumped into a Hogwarts student, causing both of them to drop their belongings. After the two apologised to each other, Hermione noticed that the spine on one of the student's books was broken, watching as they used the Mending Charm to fix it. Hermione asked if the student was enjoying their time at Hogwarts, which the student confirmed, although they admitted feeling somewhat overwhelmed on account of being Muggle-born. Hermione, herself a Muggle-born witch, reassured the student that they didn't have to learn everything in their first year, before asking them what their favourite class was.   Upon hearing their answer, she explained that Study of Ancient Runes was one of her favourite classes, to which the student, who hadn't previously recognised Hermione, revealed that they had just purchased a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard newly translated from Ancient Runes by Hermione Granger, noting that the picture of the author looked just like her. Hermione explained that she was indeed the author of the book and thanked them for buying a copy, asking them to send her an owl when they had finished in order to hear their thoughts on it. Hermione then wished the student luck in their studies, asking them to say hello to Neville Longbottom and Rubeus Hagrid for her as well.[32]  Hermione encountering the student at Hogwarts On 19 September, her birthday of a certain year, Hermione went back to Hogwarts in reminiscence. While at Hogwarts she visited the Library, as it was one of her favorite locations within the school. During her school days she spent extensive amounts of time within its walls. While in the library she encountered the same student. She noticed the book they were holding and told her story that involved it.[37]  Hermione with others at the end of the battle Hermione also came to Hogwarts's aid when the school fell under attack by Dementors and other Dark creatures, and joined the big battle at the end. When it was over, she discussed the possible cause of the attacks with Harry, Ron and the Hogwarts staff, noting that the other creatures couldn't have been swayed by the Dementors to join the attacks, since they were not easily affected by them as humans would be.[38]  Hermione and Harry meeting the student at Zonko's When Ron Weasley asked Hermione to help him sell joke products and compete against his brother George, who had already invited Harry, she couldn't say no, and so she came to Zonko's Joke Shop when\nthey were having a sale there, though she didn't really care for pranks and found that she was not good at promoting the products with passion. She was having a conversation with Harry in the shop when they met the Muggle-born student, who was surprised to see Hermione was the important guest that Ron claimed to have invited, seeing as she didn't seem to be the kind of person that was interested in joke products. Hermione agreed and talked about her feelings with them, and gave them some tokens to buy products with to save herself from doing her promotion speech.[39]  Hermione with her husband and two children By 2017, Hermione and Ron were married with two children: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. She had several nieces and nephews through her marriage to Ron. Hermione was also the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest child, James Sirius.[40]  Newspaper report on the trio joining the Ministry Hermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic, first through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. There, she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of underprivileged non-humans such as house-elves. She then went on to become Deputy Head[12] of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and assisted the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of pure-bloods. Along with Harry and Ron, she helped to revolutionise the Ministry and reform the wizarding world. At some point, Hermione, Harry, and Ron were all featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments.[41]  Hermione also eventually translated The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the original, which had been written in runes and which Albus Dumbledore bequeathed to her in his will in 1997. Her new translation was published in 2008 and included notes on each tale written by Dumbledore before his death; these notes were lent to Hermione by her former professor, Hogwarts Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.[42]  Both Hermione and Ron attended the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and sat in VIP Box Two. Rita Skeeter noted that Ron had become catatonic at the appearance of the Bulgarian Veela and Hermione had to elbow him in the ribs.  On 1 September 2017, Hermione and Ron brought their children to King's Cross Station to see Rose off for her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and met Harry, Ginny, and their three children there.  At some point between 2019 and 2020, Hermione was elected as Minister for Magic.[43] In the summer of 2020, Hermione had to visit Harry to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do. She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when Voldemort was alive. Harry reminded her that he did just find a Time-Turner and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own time. They agreed that the Time-Turner should be destroyed and Hermione hid it away.  A few months later, Hermione was returning to\nher office when she was stopped by Ron, who was really Albus Pot", "PPL": 0.2428550124168396, "PPL/lower": 0.32781397197462886, "PPL/zlib": 6.76287976655081e-05, "Min-5%": 4.6532996022233775, "Min-10%": 2.420251217378559, "Min-20%": 1.213515600799822, "Min-30%": 0.8091725794359942, "Min-40%": 0.6075857679775465, "Min-50%": 0.4859026552596515, "Min-60%": 0.40481157070977836}, {"text": "the second task was going into the Black Lake to rescue \"the thing they would miss most\" from the merpeople. Harry's new problem was how he was going to survive underwater for an hour. He got his answer in the form of gillyweed from Dobby, who had come to work at Hogwarts. The second task took place on 24 February. Harry was able to save Ron, but when he reached him he was shocked to find Hermione, Cho, and Gabrielle Delacour (Fleur's sister), there as well. After the other hostages were rescued, Harry hung around and saved Gabrielle, as well as Ron. The judges were then informed that Harry reached to hostages first. He was outside the hour that had been allotted, although doing so earned him extra points for \"moral fibre\". After the second task had finished, Harry and Cedric were tied for first, Viktor was in second, and Fleur was in last place.  The trio visiting Sirius in the cave in which he was hiding After Harry was mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament, Sirius hid in a cave near Hogsmeade, where Harry, Ron, and Hermione occasionally visited him, and provided mostly moral support to Harry during this time. Sirius warned him about Igor Karkaroff, the Durmstrang headmaster, telling Harry that Karkaroff used to be a Death Eater and that he gave up a considerable number of names in exchange for his freedom. Harry told Sirius about seeing the name \"Bartemius Crouch\" appear on the Marauder's Map when he was working on the second clue. Sirius admitted that it was fishy, but told Harry to focus on the task at hand and leave the mystery surrounding Crouch to others.  A month before the final task, the Champions were shown the beginnings of the challenge. Harry and Cedric both expressed horror at the sight of the Quidditch pitch being turned into the hedge maze, put were quickly reassured by Bagman that it would be put right after the Tournament. They were told the third and final task was going into a maze filled with obstacles to find the Triwizard Cup. On the way back to the castle, Krum took Harry aside to ask him something. Thinking that this was something important, Harry went with him.  Hermione receiving hate mail from in response to Skeeter's article about her and Harry Krum then asked Harry\nabout his relationship with Hermione, in whom Krum was deeply interested. Harry told him that there was nothing between him and Hermione and that she was just a friend. He also told Krum not to believe anything Rita Skeeter, who had recently written in Witch Weekly that there was a Harry-Hermione-Krum love triangle, wrote about him. This supposed love triangle also led to Hermione receiving numerous amounts of hate mail. At that moment, Barty Crouch Snr appeared in the forest disoriented and asking for Dumbledore. He disappeared when Harry went to fetch Dumbledore.  Harry preparing to enter Dumbledore's Pensieve without permission During a Divination lesson, Harry passed out and had a vision of Voldemort being informed of someone's death and him torturing Wormtail for failing to prevent someone from escaping. Harry awoke with his scar badly hurting and pretended he needed to go to the hospital wing, he actually went to see Dumbledore. Once in the headmaster's office, Harry overheard an argument between Dumbledore, Moody, and Cornelius Fudge, regarding the Barty Crouch situation: Fudge refused to believe the words that Crouch said about Bertha Jorkins being dead and, while debating what had happened to Crouch, Fudge suggested that Madame Maxime was the likely culprit given her half-giant physiology. Dumbledore then accused the Minister of acting on personal prejudice, which he ignored due to Dumbledore's friendship with Hagrid. Moody interrupted the debate to explain that Harry had arrived.  Harry witnessing the trial of the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jnr through the pensieve Harry was left alone in the office after Dumbledore, Fudge, and Moody left to examine the school grounds. While looking around, Harry noticed Dumbledore's Pensieve. Through curiosity, Harry peered in and ended up looking into three of Dumbledore's memories, from the days immediately after the end of the First Wizarding War. The first was the trial of Igor Karkaroff, in which he renounced his support of the Death Eaters and gave the names of existing Death Eaters, including Snape. Dumbledore (in the memory) stated that Snape had defected the Death Eaters and was a spy against Voldemort and no longer a threat.   The second memory showed the trial of Ludo Bagman, who was accused of passing information to Voldemort, but his popularity quickly cleared him. The third was the trial of the Lestranges (Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan) and Crouch's son, for the use of the Cruciatus Curse on Alice and Frank Longbottom. Crouch sentenced them all to a lifetime in Azkaban.  To prepare for the final task, Harry, Ron, and Hermione used vacant classrooms to practise spells and jinxes. In Divination class between two of these study periods, Harry dozed off dreaming about Voldemort and left the classroom in a disturbing fashion. Rita Skeeter had witnessed this event and she wrote, on 24 June, 1995, the day of the final task, that Harry was \"disturbed and dangerous\". This did nothing to boost Harry's morale, but when he spent the day with Bill and Molly Weasley, they cheered him up. They also came to watch the final\ntask as his substitute family.[47]  Harry in the hedge maze with an Imperiused Viktor Krum Harry successfully navigated the maze with the aid of the Four-Point Spell. He got past both a Blast-Ended-Skrewt and a Boggart disguised as a Dementor. Along the way, he heard Fleur scream. Harry rescued Cedric, who had been attacked by an bewitched Krum; Harry managed to stun Krum and send out a signal for Krum to be rescued before he and Cedric moved on. Harry managed to pass a sphinx.[47]  During this final event, Harry saved Cedric from an Acromantula and Cedric being grateful offered Harry the cup. Both Hogwarts champions then showed supreme sportsmanship and cooperation despite the tension brought on by the maze. They agreed to touch the Triwizard Cup simultaneously, as it would be a Hogwarts victory either way, which would result in tie for first place. Harry and Cedric were unaware that the cup was actually a portkey and were transported to the graveyard in Little Hangleton.[47]  Cedric's murder at the hands of Peter Pettigrew and Lord Voldemort This graveyard was the Riddle family's final resting place, where Lord Voldemort was waiting. Just as Harry and Cedric are trying to figure out what happened, someone appears and Harry's scar begins hurting again. Acting on Voldemort's orders, his servant Wormtail murdered Cedric with the Killing Curse. Harry saw a flash of green light and heard Cedric's body hit the graveyard's ground with a thud. Harry is then dragged to a large marble tombstone, with the name Tom Riddle engraved upon were he is bound. From there he was forced to witness a ritual in which Pettigrew used some of Harry's blood to restore Voldemort's body. The Death Eaters were summoned to the cemetery.  After his Death Eaters arrived, Voldemort spends time criticising them for failing to seek him out during these last thirteen years, even though they knew that he had found a way to escape mortal death. He then rewards Wormtail for aiding with his rebirth by creating a new silver hand for him. The Dark Lord identifies more Death Eaters and reveals that this servant who is at Hogwarts has ensured that Harry would win the tournament and be brought to the graveyard. Voldemort then frees the injured and weakened Harry and orders him to face him in a duel, wishing to prove who among the two is stronger in front of his minions now that there is no one around to protect Harry.  Harry duelling Voldemort in a battle of wills, triggering the effect of Priori Incantatem When Harry refused to observe the formalities of a wizard's duel, Voldemort used the Imperius Curse to force Harry to bow to him. Voldemort then tortured him by subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse and attempted to use the Imperius Curse again, but Harry was able to resist it the second time.

Draco himself has lost his bigotry for less-than-pure wizards, and his willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end at himself in order to preserve Astoria's health due to her blood-bourne curse earned Lucius' dislike. Regardless, he did not lose favour of his parents, as he inherited the Malfoy Manor and Lucius' collection of artefacts (which included the 'true' Time-Turner that proved instrumental later).  Draco with his wife and son Sometime after the end of the war, Draco married Astoria Greengrass, whose older sister was in the same year as him at Hogwarts. They eventually had a son named Scorpius.  Draco and his wife evidently loved and cared for their son, raising him to be a better person than himself, proven when Scorpius has a crush on Rose Granger-Weasley (daughter of Draco's former rivals) and is best friend of Albus Potter (youngest son of Draco's former arch-rival) he and his wife considered the day their son was born the best day of their lives. Astoria's death has caused Draco to be heartbroken, and he even considered using the illegal 'true' Time-Turner he received from his father as a means to see her again, though he barely resisted the urge. Draco would have gladly let the Malfoy family line end with him if it were to preserve Astoria's health, disregarding Lucius' wishes, but Astoria did want to leave behind someone for her husband, not for the sake of family beliefs. Draco certainly raised Scorpius more strictly than how Lucius and Narcissa raised him, as when Scorpius was to be punished by Minerva McGonagall for utilising the Time-Turner to corrupt reality to the point of reviving Voldemort, Draco stated he was prepared to listen to how his son is to be punished.[30]  Bellatrix Lestrange, his maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange was Draco's maternal aunt, being the sister of Narcissa. When Draco was younger he didn't have much contact with his aunt because she was imprisoned in Azkaban for torturing the Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom (who were the parents of Neville Longbottom, a Gryffindor in the\nsame year at Hogwarts as Draco), into insanity. However, Draco did not feel any shame in his aunt's crimes against the wizarding world law that many would label as disgraceful. After Bellatrix escaped in Draco's fifth year at Hogwarts, she fought in a battle against Harry Potter and his friends and was the only Death Eater who wasn't captured; Draco's father, who had also fought, was imprisoned. After Draco was given a mission as a Death Eater, Bellatrix helped him and taught him Occlumency, nonverbal spells, and the Dark Arts. She also thought that Narcissa should be proud that her son became a Death Eater.  In 1997, Bellatrix lived for some months at Malfoy Manor, to be closer to Voldemort, who was also staying there. Bellatrix and Draco both participated in the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor; Draco reluctantly watched Bellatrix's torturing of Hermione Granger. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix was killed by Molly Weasley.  It is unknown how Draco reacted to her death, but it is likely he may have felt sadness as Bellatrix seemed to have some affection with Draco. However, given that Draco and his family regretted their allegiance with Voldemort, and that Draco abandoned his prejudice against non-pure bloods after the war, it is possible his opinion on Bellatrix changed considerably as she was fanatically loyal to, and obsessively in love with, Voldemort. Also, despite Delphini being Bellatrix's daughter, Draco did not hesitate to assist in her arrest after she had threatened his son's life.  Nymphadora Tonks, his maternal first cousin Draco was not close to his aunt Andromeda Tonks, who had been disowned for marrying Muggle-born Ted Tonks, or their daughter, his cousin Nymphadora. Like much of the rest of his family, Draco likely held these relatives in contempt; Andromeda was considered a blood traitor and Tonks was a half-blood. In addition, Tonks had married Remus Lupin, a werewolf, which the Death Eaters scorned to humiliate Draco. Since Draco was too scared of Voldemort to respond, his feelings on the subject are unknown. Tonks referred to him as 'The Malfoy boy', indicating she either did not know his name or despised him too much to care. Neither so much as mentioned their relation to one another. Similarly, Draco was indifferent to his first cousin once removed, Sirius Black.[18]  Sirius Black, his maternal first cousin, once removed Both cousins were killed by Bellatrix, Sirius in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and Tonks in the Battle of Hogwarts respectively. His cousin, the illegitimate child of Bellatrix Lestrange, his aunt, and Tom Riddle, his former leader, was Delphini, whom he helped Harry Potter fight in the year 2020, after discovering she was Voldemort's daughter, and after she tried to kill his son Scorpius. He did not have any love for Delphi, as he assisted arresting her for the murder of Craig Bowker Jnr.  Draco Malfoy and his cohorts Draco's two constant companions throughout his Hogwarts years were Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Crabbe and Goyle were often involved in Draco's confrontations with Harry\nPotter and his friends. Though Draco often made it clear that he considered both of them rather stupid \u2014 a legitimate claim \u2014 and treated them more like lackeys than friends[17], he showed genuine concern for them and the rest of his gang on a few occasions; when Goyle was bitten by Scabbers the Rat, Draco waited for Goyle before leaving, and he also showed concern for Goyle when he was hit by Harry's Curse, when Dumbledore expressed his disgust with Draco for allowing Fenrir Greyback 'into the school where his friends live,' Draco denied knowing he would be there, clearly disturbed by the sadistic werewolf's unexpected presence. Draco's abrupt departure from his criminal activities left Crabbe and Goyle looking oddly lonely to Harry, as Harry was used to seeing Draco in between the two hulking boys, bossing them around.  By the final confrontation between Draco and Harry in the Room of Requirement, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco no longer exerted much control over his friends; Crabbe, in particular, responded harshly to Draco's attempts to prevent them from killing Harry. Draco tried desperately to save both of his friends from the cursed fire Crabbe unleashed, helping pull Goyle onto Ron and Hermione's broom before letting Harry fly the two of them out, and was very upset by Crabbe's death. Although it was Ron and Hermione who saved Goyle from falling into the fire, if it wasn't for Draco who dragged Goyle to safety, Ron and Hermione would never had saved Goyle, so it can be considered that Draco saved Goyle's life.[21]  In 2020, an adult Draco admitted to Harry and his wife that his relationship with Crabbe and Goyle could never really have been called friendship, as they had little in common except the prejudices they had inherited from their families, and Crabbe and Goyle were far too stupid to be reliable cohorts in much.  Draco also admitted that he had always envied Harry's close friendship with Ron and Hermione, in stark contrast to the emptiness of his relationship with his two 'best friends' at Hogwarts.

It was a terribly painful moment for him, and led to him changing his ways.[16]  Albus Dumbledore visiting the Dursleys When Albus Dumbledore paid a personal visit to the Dursleys in 1996, he showed pity for Dudley, blaming the Dursleys for the \"appalling damage\" their parenting inflicted on their son. Dudley was very confused by this statement, and did not show any signs of planning to rectify his parents' \"mistakes\".  As Harry and Dumbledore leave, Dumbledore told the Dursleys that in summer 1997 that they have to evacuate their house to protect themselves from becoming the victims of Lord Voldemort and Death Eaters.[17]  After Harry arrived at Number Four, in 1997, Dudley made at least one known attempt to reconcile with Harry. Dudley placed a cup of tea outside Harry's room. However, Harry initially misinterpreted the gesture as another prank, as Dudley had placed the cup on the floor and Harry stepped on it by accident. When Harry parted ways with the Dursleys, Dudley was the only member to bid Harry farewell.[18]  Dudley shaking Harry's hand as they parted ways at Number 4 Privet Drive When Dudley was attacked by the Dementors he saw himself, for the first time, as he really was. This was an\nextremely painful but ultimately salutary lesson and began the transformation in him. He shook Harry's hand and thanked him for saving his life. The members of the Order of the Phoenix escorting the Dursleys into hiding were not satisfied by this and thought a more adequate apology was in order, but the Dursleys left with nothing more to say, Harry himself noting that Dudley's awkward thanks was the Dursley equivalent of a heartfelt expression of gratitude.[18]  In Dudley's adult life, he became a father of two. He and Harry remained on \"Christmas card terms,\" and Harry sometimes took his children to Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood, occasions dreaded by James, Albus, and Lily.[19] During these visits, Dudley and Harry would sit silently together rarely talking while their children interacted and played together. It is unknown if Dudley ever returned to Little Whinging or if their family had stayed in the place they were relocated to,[20] or if they had moved elsewhere. By 2020, Dudley's mother had passed away.  Dudley, age 15 Dudley had watery blue eyes and thick blond hair. Growing up, Dudley was extremely fat, at least four times Harry's size.[7] Harry often thought Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. In 1994, he had \"reached the size and weight of a young killer whale\"[13] \u2014 somewhere between 265 and 353 pounds.[2] Dudley was too large to fit in a school uniform, so was forced to go on a diet by his school, which was largely comprised of food which Vernon called \"rabbit food\" (fruits and vegetables) which Dudley rarely ate otherwise. Vernon and Petunia usually made excuses on why he was large, such as that his poundage was really \"puppy fat\" or that he was a \"growing boy\".  Dudley mostly ate junk food, hated exercise, and often played video games. When Harry and the Dursleys ate breakfast Dudley's flab would often hang off the chair because he was too big and eventually a TV was bought for the kitchen after Dudley had complained about the distance from the living room to the fridge, which was an example of his great laziness. This may have had something to do with his weight problem.  However, by 1995 after he was attacked by Umbridge's dementors, Dudley had taken up boxing and weight lifting, and lost a great deal of weight.[14] Before the Dursleys left Privet Drive, he appeared \"large, blond, and muscular,\" wearing a leather jacket.[18]  A photograph of a very spoiled Dudley Dudley was an unpleasant and spoiled child. His parents spoiled him to the point of becoming grossly obese, demanding, selfish, and manipulative, but most of all, extremely ungrateful. During his eleventh birthday, he screamed when he received one gift fewer than the previous year, making his parents promise to buy him two more, and pretended to cry when he realised Harry would have to come with him for his birthday trip to the zoo.[7]  Dudley had an awful habit of bullying children who were weaker and as much as five years\nyounger than he was, and when he forgot his fear of Harry's powers, callously insulted him in any way possible, even jeering at Harry about his obviously disturbing nightmares.[14]  Despite being fairly manipulative, Dudley appeared to have a low level of intelligence. In 1991, whilst Rubeus Hagrid was attempting to enter the Hut-on-the-Rock, he foolishly quoted \"Where's the cannon?\" showing poor common sense.[9] In the school holiday of 1994, he received a dismal school report from Smeltings Academy, which included very poor academic results as well as reports of bullying others.[13]  However, in 1995, Dudley faced dementors for the first time. Though a Dementor attack typically forced a person to re-live the worst moments of their life, Dudley's life-so-far of luxury and greed contained no \"worst moments,\" and therefore, during the attack, Dudley saw himself as the spoiled, rotten and cruel bully he truly was. He was thus forced, rather harshly, to realise he needed to change his ways. This led to him regretting his treatment of Harry and his later attempts at reconciliation.[20] The cousins would have a relatively good relationship by 2017: Dudley and Harry visited each other, while their children played together.[21]  Dudley with his parents, Vernon and Petunia Dursley Vernon and Petunia Dursley spoiled and coddled their son as much as they neglected and abused their nephew Harry. They appeared to buy Dudley anything he wanted, often apparently to waylay a tantrum (Vernon going so far as bribing him to accept a kiss from Aunt Marge). They indulged their son with treats and activities both out of blind adoration for the boy and as a means of emphasising to Harry what he was missing.   They were generally in denial of the obesity brought on by Dudley's gluttony, which they wrote off as being either the healthy appetite of a growing boy or that his poundage was really \"puppy fat\" and were completely oblivious to the fact that Dudley did not have friends, so much as a schoolyard gang and victims.  While Vernon consistently praised his son as if he was extremely masculine and robust, Petunia infantilised Dudley, calling him \"Diddykins\" well in to his teen years, appearing heartbroken to have to put Dudley on a much-needed diet and even bursting into tears when Dudley showed marginal affection for Harry.[18]  Harry Potter, his maternal cousin  Dudley and his cousin Harry did not get along very well for most of their early lives. Like his parents, Dudley only thought of Harry as a huge burden to the family. Whilst Vernon and Petunia treated Harry poorly, they spoiled Dudley to the extreme. Dudley constantly bullied Harry throughout their childhood, but did his best not to provoke him after he found out that Harry was a wizard, though the two still often argued and traded insults. This changed after Harry saved Dudley from a pair of dementors that attacked them during the summer of 1995.   When the Order of the Phoenix placed the Dursleys into hiding to keep them safe during the\nheight of the Second Wizarding War, Dudley was the only member of the family to express concern for Harry's safety, asking his parents why Harry was not accompanying them and where he would go, if not with them. He also expressed remorse for his earlier treatment of Harry", "PPL": 0.22906383872032166, "PPL/lower": 0.3917297251345297, "PPL/zlib": 6.658832520939582e-05, "Min-5%": 4.1883142193158465, "Min-10%": 2.260237378999591, "Min-20%": 1.1426308663120188, "Min-30%": 0.7627964154263528, "Min-40%": 0.5729765404269958, "Min-50%": 0.4582884463466584, "Min-60%": 0.38181935819704643}, {"text": "aired decades of pent-up emotion left over from the horrors of his childhood and Dumbledore reassuring him he did what he though was best for Harry's well being at the time, the portrait advised him to see Albus as he is. Harry demanded that Albus break off his association with Scorpius. He even went so far as to bully Headmistress Minerva McGonagall into using the Marauder's Map to keep them apart. This was something that he would not normally do. Harry's worry for his son had intensified so much that it blinded him to the bigger picture.  When Albus and Scorpius went time travelling again, Harry and Ginny received a visit from Draco. He and Harry argued about their children, which resulted in a premature wizards'\nduel. When Ginny intervened and reminded them their children were missing, Draco surprised them by explaining how lonely he was at Hogwarts and how lucky Harry was to have such great friendships.  Harry apologising to Professor McGonagall and attempting to locate the boys Harry and Draco finally gained a mutual respect for one another, and looked upon each other as friends. When Draco speaks of the great bond and sacrifices he has made for Scorpius and his late wife, Harry finally realised he was dangerously isolating Albus. They returned to Hogwarts, where Harry apologised to Professor McGonagall and they attempted to locate the boys, ultimately discovering that they had the Time-Turner.  However, in the other timeline, Albus and Scorpius had created a world where Harry had died at the Battle of Hogwarts. Fortunately, with the help of the alternate Hermione, Ron and Severus Snape, Scorpius managed to salvage the original timeline and returned both Harry, and Albus to life. Harry visited Albus in his dormitory where despite his anger, he manages to plant the seed for a reconciliation with Albus.  Harry visiting Albus in the Hospital Wing and the two beginning to reconcile Later, Harry and his friends learn that Albus and Scorpius were missing again and were last seen with Delphi. They went to see Amos to find out what he knows, and found out he had been Confunded by Delphi into believing she was his niece and carer.  Searching the room for clues to find out Delphi's true identity, they stumbled upon a prophecy that, if fulfilled, would enable the return of Voldemort, and realised Delphi's true identity as Voldemort's secret daughter with Bellatrix Lestrange. However, since they did not know where in time Delphi, Albus, and Scorpius were, they could only bide their time and wait.  At home, Harry looked at the blanket he had tried to give Albus. He noticed writing on it, and found out it was a message sent by Albus from the past. He and Ginny noticed the date, being 30 October, 1981 \u2014 one day before the night that Voldemort murdered Harry's parents. They alerted Ron and Hermione. Draco, who joined in, secretly revealed to them that his family had a Time-Turner that would be more potent and valuable than the one seized by the Ministry, which was merely a prototype and thus not as desirable to a true Death Eater.  Harry, Ron, Draco, and others travelling back in time to assist Albus and Scorpius They travelled back in time to join Albus and Scorpius. However, under Ginny's prodding, they realised that Delphi did not to want to kill baby Harry, but rather to stop Voldemort from doing so in the hope he would live and his reign would continue. Delphi thought she could make her father stronger as he would know love when he met her, which its lacking was what had originally led to his downfall.  Everyone agreed they had to transfigure Harry to look like Voldemort in the hope that they could fool Delphi\nand hinder her in saving the real Voldemort. They picked Harry because he not only knew Voldemort well through the connection they shared when he was a Horcrux, but he now also understood Parseltongue again.  Delphi pleaded with her \"father\" to recognise her, which Harry managed before the transfiguration spell came undone. However, when Delphi sees she had been set up, she engaged in a fierce duel with Harry, who is later joined by his friends and Albus. They managed to subdue her and she pleaded that she only wants to know her father. A surprised Harry explained that this would not be possible; they cannot change the past.  Upon hearing the real Voldemort arrive to kill Harry's parents, Delphi tried calling out to him, but Hermione and Malfoy silenced her and sent her back to present day. Harry decided to watch the scene of his parents' murder once more, with Albus by his side, to provide a sense of closure for them. They later returned to the present when a devastated Hagrid arrived at the scene to bring Harry to the Dursleys.  Back at Hogwarts, Albus was asked by Harry to join him one afternoon for a hike up a steep hill. Harry revealed that he had brought Albus to Cedric Diggory's grave, which he regularly visited so he could apologise for his role in his death.  At some point during Kingsley's tenure as Minister, Harry helped advance werewolf rights by setting up an outreach programme.[112] He also proposed providing free Wolfsbane Potions to any werewolf who wanted the potion. However, his Wolfsbane proposal never came to fruition, as politics and protocols prevented it from happening.[112]  Shortly after, Harry was made the leader of the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force. This task force was an emergency response team established by the International Confederation of Wizards with the help of the British Ministry of Magic to deal with a series of large-scale breaches of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy known as the Calamity. He congratulated those who choose the career of an Auror, but warned them that it could either be the best or worst job depending on their abilities.  Harry introduced the Weakening Hex to the new Aurors, which lowered the damage their enemies caused. He would also teach and supervise practising duelling sessions, during which he outmatched them. However, their valiance allowed them to come out with increased power in their spells. For those pursuing a profession as Magizoologists, Harry gave them a lesson on maintaining confidence that eventually resulted in him teaching them the Bravery Charm, while he ran a class on detecting dark magic for those pursuing a Professor position.[112]  Harry was inspired by his experience with the late Remus Lupin to arrange a training course which was attended by all Statute of Secrecy Task Force members. The training course needed to be completed without a wand as spells flew towards the task force members, helping to teach them better tactical awareness and mobility. Along with his\nwife, Ginny, and Professor Minerva McGonagall, his former teacher at Hogwarts, Harry held a panel at the Ministry where the three spoke about having parts of their lives turned into Foundables by the Calamity, with the emotional evening being attended by a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[112]  Harry later ran into the same Calamity Investigator at the Leaky Cauldron and engaged in a lively discussion about potions with them. He taught them Severus Snape's method of preparing Sopophorous beans by pressing them with the flat side of a knife to release more of their juice, which they used to reduce the brew time of their Dawdle Draught. Harry later met the same Calamity Investigator for tea, with the investigator convincing him that he needed to be more of an active public voice in order to best help the fight against the Calamity.[112]  After an article about his work with the Task Force was published in the Daily Prophet, several of Harry's belongings became Foundables. Hermione suspected that this had to do with the article.[113]  In the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Harry and Hermione after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders. When Minerva McGonagall was uncharacteristically late in reporting to the SOS Task Force, Constance Pickering, Harry, and Hermione feared she had been attacked.

At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied, to the point where she was nearly made a Ravenclaw by the Sorting Hat.  Hermione first met her future best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an \"insufferable know-it-all\", an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they\nhad saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends. She later played a crucial role in protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort.     In her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, before falling victim to the Basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. However, she recovered from the petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with Professor Sprout's Mandrake Restorative Draught. The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.  During her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W., and helped in Harry's preparation for the Triwizard Tournament. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's Army and fought alongside fellow D.A. members in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.  Hermione played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, as well. In 1997, she fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters, alongside the Order of the Phoenix. Hermione and Ron decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies, instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, a quest in which several of her actions were essential. She destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup, a Horcrux, with Ron using a Basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione then fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, helping in the defeat of the Death Eater who tortured her: Bellatrix Lestrange.  Following the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education. She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves. Afterward, she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of pure-bloods. Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo. She became the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest son James.

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. He was both a Prefect and Quidditch Captain during his time at school, after which he went to study dragons in Romania.  During the Second Wizarding War, Charlie was a member of the second Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, arriving with reinforcements during the final portion of the battle. He was also present when Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort once and for all.  Charlie survived the Second Wizarding War and continued his work with dragons. He never married and had no children,[12] but through his siblings and their respective marriages, he had many nieces and nephews.  Charles Weasley was the second of seven children born to Arthur and Molly Weasley.[13] He was a child during the height of the First Wizarding War. In the fighting, his maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both members of the Order of the Phoenix, were murdered fighting Antonin Dolohov and four other Death Eaters.[14] While he was still\na child, the wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after Lord Voldemort's first defeat on 31 October 1981.  Charlie and his five brothers \u2014 Bill, Percy, Fred, George, and Ron \u2014 as well as his younger sister, Ginny,[15] grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing, and simple maths by his mother.   The Weasley family was not wealthy compared to other wizarding families. Many other pure-blood families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"blood traitor\", pro-Muggle beliefs and their lack of wealth.[16] They tried their best to make up for this with their love. It can be assumed that Charlie had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did.  Charlie showed a keen interest in dragons from a young age. During a game of truth-or-dare with friends sometime during in 1989\u20131990, Bill Weasley revealed that, in his youth, Charlie used to try and turn the family pets into dragons. Since this was before he started at Hogwarts and knew any spells, he would settle on sticking paper wings on Scabbers using Spellotape and on making Errol fly around with a dragon mask, and then following them around while jotting down his \"observations of dragon behaviour\".[17]  1984 Sorting Ceremony, with Charlie standing next to Nymphadora Tonks On 1 September 1984, Charlie started his first term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Gryffindor House like the rest of his family, and was in the same year as Hufflepuff Nymphadora Tonks.  By the end of his second year, Charlie became the Seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[18] He greatly excelled in the position.  In his third year, Charlie elected to take Care of Magical Creatures[19] class, since he liked working outdoors, and Muggle Studies.[20] It was around this time that he sneaked into the Forbidden Forest, having become convinced that he could catch a dragon in there. Well aware of the dangerous creatures within, Bill reluctantly accompanied him so his little brother would not have to face such dangers on his own.[21]  He would later admit to Jacob's sibling how he had been sneaking into the Forbidden Forest more often than Bill or the teachers knew about. In the forest he had met and befriended a centaur by the name of Torvus, though he seldom talked about it because he did not want to brag or know where he sometimes went off to.  In his fourth year, Charlie was involved in Jacob's sibling's search for the Forest Vault, and joined them many times in searches in the Forbidden Forest.[22] He entered the Forest Vault along with Jacob's sibling, Rubeus Hagrid, Torvus and another student (either Rowan Khanna, Penny Haywood or Bill Weasley). In the vault, he was excited to see a dragon portrait.[23]  Charlie during his Hogwarts years. By his fifth year, Charlie was appointed as a prefect.[14] Near the beginning of his fifth year, he joined\na study session with his brothers Bill and Percy, as well as Jacob's sibling.[24] That year, he and Jacob's sibling also sold items and worked to get money to buy a dragon egg from the suspicious Alistair Fidgen, although this egg later turned out to be an Acromantula egg. However, as Charlie got a piece of a dragon, he was nonetheless satisfied.[25]  Later that year, Charlie, Bill, Percy and Jacob's sibling asked Nearly Headless Nick questions about the Marauder's Map. Charlie got excited when Sir Nicholas mentioned that Jacob had believed there had been a dragon in the castle. Later, Charlie and Bill went to the Prefects' Bathroom to look for Duncan Ashe. Charlie was disappointed when Duncan left before he had a chance to ask about the dragon.[26]  In the Buried Vault, when the Hungarian Horntail was out of its portrait, the students there were all terrified, although Charles Weasley was happy and amazed because of seeing this dangerous breed of dragon.[27]  Charlie wearing his Quidditch captain badge Charlie eventually became Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team[28] at some point in his fifth year or later.[29] After he left Hogwarts, the Seeker position for the Gryffindor Quidditch team was taken by Harry Potter and the Quidditch Captain position was taken by Keeper Oliver Wood.  Early in his sixth year, Charlie considered dropping out of Hogwarts due to what had happened in the Buried Vault in the previous school year. However, Jacob's sibling convinced him to finish his education.[30]  Charlie as a member of the Circle of Khanna Sometime during the year, Charlie became a founding member of the Circle of Khanna, a group devoted to avenging Rowan Khanna and locating the final Cursed Vault. It was at the groups first meeting in the Hog's Head Inn that he learned of the malevolent organisation \"R\" and it's motives to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.[31]  Charlie that year also met with Jacob's sibling in the Three Broomsticks Inn and agreed to help them talk with the ghost of Duncan Ashe in the Prefects' Bathroom for information about their brother. Ashe told them both in the bathroom that he and Jacob often spent time in the Boathouse, when they then searched for information, eventually finding a letter written to Jacob's sibling from Jacob concealed as a Black Quill.[32]  Charlie took his Apparition test twice. He failed on the first attempt, materialising five miles south of his target location on top of an old woman doing her shopping. He passed on the second attempt. His brothers Fred and George made fun of this, but not to his face.[33]  He", "PPL": 0.11424335837364197, "PPL/lower": 0.17518547160638534, "PPL/zlib": 3.4173903192833376e-05, "Min-5%": 2.197589098530657, "Min-10%": 1.1328317571668793, "Min-20%": 0.569808276963345, "Min-30%": 0.3803860060544533, "Min-40%": 0.28574667367772516, "Min-50%": 0.22855935191992752, "Min-60%": 0.19042686280223362}, {"text": "the Locked Room, he talked to Jacob's sibling in the Courtyard. Instead of handing out punishment, Dumbledore awarded them 100 House points for their brave acts. Nevertheless, he reminded them that the impact on others should be kept in mind in their coming years.[78]  At the end of the school year, Dumbledore announced the winner of the House Cup as usual.[84]  Dumbledore spent most of the 1985\u20131986 school year outside Hogwarts, looking for a professional Curse-Breaker, Patricia Rakepick, whose help he needed for finding the Cursed Vaults.[85]  He was present at the Start-of-Term Feast, delivering his welcoming speech while also offering a word of caution. Ben Copper was soon found missing, and Dumbledore was possibly paid a visit by Professor McGonagall, who informed him the secret message Jacob's sibling had found in the Locked Room.[86] After Dumbledore was gone, he possibly received an owl from one of the professors alerting him to the activities of R.[87]  Dumbledore discussing recent events with Jacob's sibling When he was back at Hogwarts, he found that the Vault of Ice had again been broken into by Jacob's sibling and their friends, which led to the disappearance of the cursed ice. He required to see them in the Headmaster's office and rewarded them another 50 points, but warned them never to go near the Cursed Vaults again.[88]  Dumbledore talking to Aur\u00e9lie Dumont At some point while he was at Hogwarts, the Headmaster presided over this year's Teacher Appreciation Celebration, with the Guest of Honour being McGonagall.[89] At another point, Dumbledore arranged for Olympe Maxime, the Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, to visit Hogwarts to discuss school matters, and Maxime brought Aur\u00e9lie Dumont, a student of her who came to search for Nicolas Flamel's chalice. When Dumbledore met Aur\u00e9lie, he talked about his own experience of learning Alchemy with Nicolas Flamel and denied the existence of such item at Hogwarts, but nevertheless encouraged her not to give up on her goals.[32]  Dumbledore greeting the students Before the Start-of-Term Feast of the 1986\u20131987 school year, Professor Dumbledore spoke to the students, confirming the existence of the Cursed Vaults and imposing a blanket ban on all future attempts to look for the rest of them.[90] It was most likely also Dumbledore who instructed Jacob's sibling's Head of House to not permit them to go on Hogsmeade trips due to them breaking school rules and not focusing on their studies.[91]  During a third-year Herbology class, a Boggart manifested in one of the greenhouses, assuming the form of a werewolf and terrifying students. Professor Pomona Sprout reported\nthe incident to Dumbledore immediately after taking care of the Boggart.[90]  Dumbledore and Snape evaluating Merula Snyde's Wit-Sharpening Potion At some point during the school year, Dumbledore was approached by Merula Snyde, who showed him the Wit-Sharpening Potion she had allegedly been working on. He also spoke to Jacob's sibling, who was disguised as Professor Snape, about various businesses. During the conversation, he even indirectly revealed the identity of the Curse-Breaker he had been finding in the past year, who had some school years overlapping with Snape's. Though he wasn't aware of who he was actually talking to, he still figured something was off. When \"Professor Snape\" asked Merula to come forward and admit her wrongdoing of claiming credit for the potion actually brewed by Penny Haywood, Dumbledore invited Penny up on the podium to receive the credit she deserved. It was also at this moment that he realised the true identity of \"Snape\". He awarded them 10 House points for their loyalty and cheerfully advised them to leave before the effects of the Polyjuice Potion wore off.[92]  Before Dumbledore left Hogwarts again to search for Rakepick, he gave Rita Skeeter \"periodical permission\" to visit Hogwarts Castle to observe the students, and to invite them to partake in a \"friendly competition\" where the winner would receive a first-page article in the Daily Prophet.[93] During this search, Dumbledore was finally able to track down Rakepick, who was investigating some ancient ruins that had recently been discovered beneath Castelobruxo. Unable to leave Brazil until her work there was finished, an arrangement was made where she would instead come to Hogwarts at the beginning of the next term. Dumbledore doubted whether the elusiveness of Rakepick indicated problems regarding her trustworthiness, but eventually chose to give her the benefit of the doubt due to the lack of real evidence.[94]  Dumbledore back at Hogwarts When Dumbledore was back, he paid Jacob's sibling and their friends a visit in the Three Broomsticks Inn, where they were celebrating their success regarding the break-in of the Vault of Fear. Back at his office, Dumbledore listened to Jacob's sibling's vault-breaking story and talked about his own adventure. Despite them breaking the rules again, Dumbledore still awarded Jacob's sibling 100 House points, but warned them never to do it again.[94]  The Headmaster revealing his plan At some point during the school year, the International Confederation of Wizards was due to convene for a conference somewhere in Great Britain, for which Rubeus Hagrid was invited to give a demonstration on Thestrals to clear up misconceptions involving them, specifically by showing that even a Thestral that had had limited exposure to strangers could be comfortable working with several of them. To help him prepare his speech, the Headmaster advised him to solicit the assistance of Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde, hoping that working with Thestrals could help Merula, who had seen her mother murdering an Auror thus enabling her to see Thestrals, confront her past and move on. Once he had given Hagrid adequate time to get ready and time\ncame for them to depart for the meeting, Dumbledore went to the Training Grounds to collect him, and was delighted to find that both his attempt to help the troubled pupil and the aforementioned assembly had been an immense success, the latter of which had inspired many in the crowd to start treating the \"dark horses\" with kindness and respect.[95]  Dumbledore consulting Rakepick At the start of the 1987\u20131988 school year, Professor Dumbledore introduced Madam Patricia Rakepick to the entire school, charging her with everything related to the Cursed Vaults and making her an official non-teaching staff member capable of docking House points. Soon, it was found that Tulip Karasu and a couple of other students were inflicted with a sleepwalking curse, which was inevitably caused by someone tampering with another Cursed Vault.[96]  The faculty chaperoning the Celestial Ball Despite the difficulty the school was experiencing, Dumbledore and the rest of the faculty decided it needed distraction and some happy memory, so they arranged an Astronomy-themed social gathering for the students in the Great Hall known as the Celestial Ball. Dumbledore was able to persuade Madam Pince to allow the election for the head of a student committee that would be in charge of the decorations to take place in the Library. He then summoned the students to the Great Hall and announced the event, encouraging students to partake in the election for the decorating committee. Dumbledore attended the Celestial Ball with other faculty members, at the start of which he gave a short speech commending the decorating committee's success.[97]  After Jacob's sibling and their friends got out of the Forest Vault which they had successfully broken into, Dumbledore and Filch greeted them in the Forbidden Forest. Dumbledore told Jacob's sibling they continued to exhibit little respect for Hogwarts's rules and himself, and gave them detention in the Kitchens under Pitts's supervision for the next school year.[98]  It is requested that this article, or a section of this article, should be expanded.

They considered him as the greatest wizard of all time and supported him through everything (except Percy who disbelieved him about Voldemort's return) and was even the Hogwarts Headmaster during the times in which all the Weasleys attended Hogwarts.  Arthur and Molly Weasley always respected Dumbledore and were very loyal to him. Arthur, like Dumbledore, believed in the equality of all witches, wizards and Muggles while Molly considered him a great wizard who doesn't make mistakes. When the Ministry of Magic began to disbelieve Dumbledore and Harry, they supported\nthe two famous wizards rather than the Ministry and became members of the second Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore's relationship with Bill happened to be a friendly one since they were both Gryffindors and liked each other. It is very likely that he also had a good relationship with Charlie.  Percy also thought of Dumbledore as a great wizard, but sometimes odd. In 1995, Percy's relationship with Dumbledore became antagonistic when he and Harry claimed that Voldemort had returned, Percy was loyal to the Ministry and participated in discrediting Harry and Dumbledore altogether. When the truth was revealed, Percy learned he had made a mistake and in 1997, attended Dumbledore's funeral.  Fred and George appeared to respect Dumbledore very much. Dumbledore also appeared to like the twins, despite their mischief-making, but knew they were good people at heart. They even joined the second Order of the Phoenix and even Dumbledore's Army.  Ginny Weasley admired Dumbledore a lot and became his student in 1992. Dumbledore comforted and reassured Ginny after she was possessed by a fragment of Voldemort's soul and manipulated into opening the Chamber of Secrets during the 1992\u20131993 school year. Ginny was one of the first people to learn about Dumbledore's death, and the only one able to console Harry afterwards. Ginny also named her younger son, Albus Severus Potter after Dumbledore.  James and Lily Potter, his friends and former students Dumbledore first met James Potter and Lily Evans during their first year at Hogwarts, where he was the Headmaster. Dumbledore had a good relationship with both of them, knowing them both to be pure souls. James had lent Dumbledore his Invisibility Cloak, one of the three Deathly Hallows, at Dumbledore's own request for examination. After James's death, Dumbledore returned the cloak to James's son, Harry.  When the Potters became Voldemort's targets due to a prophecy made about their son and the Dark Lord, Dumbledore attempted to protect them by casting the Fidelius Charm and offering to be their Secret Keeper, but the role of Secret Keeper went instead to Peter Pettigrew, which turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter turned out to be a spy, and he betrayed Lily and James to Voldemort, who killed them. Dumbledore was very saddened by their deaths and dedicated the rest of his life to protecting their son, Harry, without giving him any happiness in his childhood. He often told Harry about the great goodness of his parents, and repeatedly consoled him with the assurance that his parents would never ever truly leave him because of their love for him. Dumbledore also believed that Harry's love for his parents was his greatest power.  The Dursleys, whom he entrusted Harry Potter to Dumbledore had been known to have at least some correspondence with the Dursley family before the birth of their nephew. In 1971, Petunia Evans wrote a letter to Dumbledore asking if she could attend Hogwarts along with her sister. Dumbledore kindly rejected her request due to her being a Muggle, which had likely contributed\nto Petunia's already growing hatred of magic. Ten years later, Dumbledore illegally dropped Petunia's nephew at her doorstep shortly after the murders of her sister and brother-in-law, despite the fact they were not named guardian candidates of Harry in the events of James and Lily's death. Dumbledore had hoped that doing so would ensure an ancient form of magic that Lily's wilful loving sacrifice for her son had created. However, Petunia and her own husband both resented Harry's presence for the next ten years.  After Harry had received his letter from Rubeus Hagrid, Vernon had denounced Dumbledore as a \"crackpot old fool\" and refused to pay for Harry's school funds. In response to this irreverent outburst, Hagrid gave a pig's tail to Vernon's son, Dudley Dursley. In the summer of 1995, Vernon was about to throw Harry out of the house when Petunia received a Howler from Dumbledore simply stating, \"Remember my last, Petunia.\" Less than a year later, Harry and Dumbledore were talking about why the former had to stay at the Dursley house despite his miserable existence he endured there.  A couple of months later, Dumbledore met with the Dursleys for the final time in his life. During his visit to their house, Dumbledore went over the protection that the Dursleys were affording Harry, Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's possessions, and current updates in the wizarding world. In addition, Dumbledore chastised the Dursleys for their indulgence of their son, Dudley. Vernon and Petunia were likely indignant at Dumbledore's remarks, although Petunia, at least in Harry's eyes, responded to Dumbledore's chastisement by looking rather flustered.  Sirius Black, his friend and former student Dumbledore had also a good relationship with Sirius Black, James Potter's best friend and Harry Potter's godfather, as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation that Dumbledore led to oppose Voldemort and his followers. Like the rest of the wizarding world, Dumbledore initially believed that Sirius was the one who betrayed Lily and James to Lord Voldemort (and helped to condemn him in Azkaban with unproven statements and lack of evidence about his supposed betrayal), but, in 1994, he learned that it was actually Peter Pettigrew. As he had no way to prove Sirius's innocence, despite being Chief Warlock and having the power to give him a trial, Dumbledore compensated by helping Hermione and Harry save Sirius from the Dementor's Kiss, and to escape from his Ministry captors, by means of a Time-Turner and Buckbeak.  The two resumed their friendship, and Sirius helped Dumbledore to recall the Order of the Phoenix an hour after Voldemort returned. However, their relationship was soon strained: Dumbledore forced Sirius to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place on account of his being a wanted convict, and because he had a tendency to act rashly, which could lead him to put himself in great danger. Though his intentions were noble, Sirius could not bring himself to appreciate Dumbledore's thoughtfulness, as he utterly despised the home which brought him many bitter, unhappy memories, and the fact that he\nwas to be alone in the house most of the time made it all the more intolerable. Nevertheless, he still trusted Dumbledore enough to confide in him about how Harry felt Voldemort awaking inside him the night that Mr Weasley was attacked. Dumbledore was devastated when Sirius died, believing that it was mostly his fault and comforted Harry to the best of his ability, and expressed his belief that Sirius was a lively man of wit and courage, with a deep and genuine concern for his loved ones, and would not hesitate to come to their rescue even if it meant putting himself in danger. Sirius's death was also a factor that led to Dumbledore confessing to Harry several things that had been kept secret from him, mainly about the true power of his mother's sacrificial protection, and the prophecy about him and Voldemort.  Remus Lupin: his friend, former student, and former colleague Another good friend of Dumbledore was Remus Lupin, one of James's and Sirius's dearest friends, and a werewolf. It was Dumbledore who, by several special precautions, ensured that Remus was able to come to Hogwarts to receive a proper magical education despite his werewolf status. He became a member of the Order of the Phoenix after his graduation.

When Albus returned, unaware of what had happened, Scorpius was overjoyed to the point of almost dragging him underwater trying to hug him in the lake. After being captured by Delphi, both boys agreed that they'd rather die than let her succeed with her plan to bring about the return of Lord Voldemort despite both being tortured with the Cruciatus Curse. Albus was horrified watching his best friend be tortured and begged Delphi to stop, demonstrating just how much he truly cares for him.  Albus with his best friend Scorpius Though under immense pressure both Albus and Scorpius are shown to work incredibly well together even if they have the occasional disagreement. This was shown when the two boys deduced what Delphi was planning to do in 1981 and how they concocted a plan to contact Albus's father via his baby blanket. While Albus is the more impulsive of the two Scorpius is more level-headed, such as when Albus wanted to see his grandparents and argued that they could handle knowing what was going to happen to them. Whereas Scorpius, who pulled him back, called him the \"worst spoiler in the world\" because Lily needed to think that Harry was going to die.  After Delphi is apprehended, the pair (and their family's) return to their own time where their relationship looked set to become even stronger than before. It's possible that they sat down and talked about all of the things that they said they would in the library, giving each other a new insight into the others lives. Back at Hogwarts, looking and sounding marginally happier than they ever had previously at the school, they talk about Scorpius asking Rose out and Albus jokes that Scorpius is an \"utter fantasist\" after he talks about their \"eventual marriage\". The two then part with another hug, grinning at each other and promising to see each other at dinner.\nAt least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\u00a0& Harry Potter: Magic Awakened.As such, spoilers will be present within the article.

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1982 to 1989 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Bill was both a Prefect and Head Boy.   After graduating from Hogwarts he went to work for Gringotts Wizarding Bank as a Curse-Breaker, working in Egypt.[13] In 1995, he returned to England and joined the reconstituted Order of the Phoenix to face the reborn Lord Voldemort.[14] During this time, he started courting Fleur Delacour and eventually proposed to her after a year of dating.  During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Bill was severely injured and scarred by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Although he wasn't turned into a werewolf, he did develop some wolfish tendencies such as a liking for very rare steaks. He married Fleur on 1 August 1997, although their wedding was disrupted by the arrival of Death Eaters following the fall of the Ministry of Magic.   Bill and Fleur then moved to Shell Cottage, where they assisted Harry, Ron, and Hermione after their escape from Malfoy Manor.\nBill later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside the rest of the Order and survived.  Following the war, Bill and Fleur had three children: Victoire, Dominique, and Louis Weasley. Bill also had several nieces and nephews.   William Weasley was the first of seven children born to Arthur and Molly Weasley.[15] He was a child during the height of the First Wizarding War, in which his maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, were murdered fighting Antonin Dolohov and four other Death Eaters.[16] While he was still a child, the Wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after Lord Voldemort's first defeat on 31 October 1981", "PPL": 0.2965393364429474, "PPL/lower": 0.38439163980038016, "PPL/zlib": 9.298818953996468e-05, "Min-5%": 5.340106764260461, "Min-10%": 2.931429626164483, "Min-20%": 1.481108574042994, "Min-30%": 0.9880170884640002, "Min-40%": 0.7419224354493418, "Min-50%": 0.5933260894429869, "Min-60%": 0.49430105082398446}, {"text": "saying that's where the weapon was hidden, where Umbridge was carried away by a herd of centaurs. She had predicted that the centaurs would let her and Harry go, since they did not insult the centaurs and were young enough to be considered \"foals\". However, the centaurs were already enraged by Umbridge and were further angered when Hermione admitted that she had hoped that they would drive Umbridge off, being insulted that they were thought of to do the bidding of humans. The centaurs were about to carry the two students off as well, but Grawp stumbled onto the scene and a fight broke out between the giant and the herd. This allowed Hermione and Harry to escape and meet up with Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville, who had escaped from the Inquisitorial Squad.  After a brief argument between Harry and Neville over whether or not the others were going to travel with Harry to London, an understanding was reached. The six students flew on Thestrals (which the majority, Hermione included, could not even see) to the Ministry of Magic to try to save Sirius from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.  The six D.A. members battling Death Eaters for possession of the prophecy Hermione's fear turned out to be justified, as Harry's vision was a ruse planted in his brain by Voldemort designed to lure him to the Ministry to obtain a prophecy Voldemort sought. As soon as Harry did this, the six D.A. members were surrounded by Death Eaters, and a battle ensued. Hermione stunned Nott when he grabbed Harry, thus freeing him and causing Nott to be injured by the collapsing shelves of prophecies. She later stunned another Death Eater and Silenced Antonin Dolohov before\nhe could alert the other Death Eaters to the group's location. She was critically injured by the curse Dolohov subsequently struck her with, but made a full recovery.[31]  Hermione visiting Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes for the first time Hermione achieved high academic prestige when she obtained ten O.W.L.s, in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Care of Magical Creatures, Arithmancy, History of Magic, Herbology, Astronomy, Potions, and Ancient Runes. She received 'Outstanding' marks on each of them, except Defence Against the Dark Arts in which she received an 'Exceeds Expectations'. In total she achieved 10 O.W.L.s. Ron found it amusing that she actually seemed disappointed by this.[35]  Hermione brewing a Draught of Living Death in a N.E.W.T.-level Potions lesson By the time they arrived in Hogwarts, Hermione's romantic feelings for Ron had become obvious. According to Harry the two seemed on their way to a romantic relationship. Hermione and Ron's relationship suffered greatly in their sixth year, when Ron became envious of both Hermione and Harry, who were invited to be members of the Slug Club, a group of students favoured by Potions professor Horace Slughorn, while he was ignored. Hermione strongly disapproved of Harry using the textbook of the \"Half-Blood Prince\" to get ahead in Potions unfairly, though she did not turn him in and indirectly found a clue about the book owner. She was particularly alarmed by the increasingly Dark nature of the magic in the book, such as the spell Sectumsempra.  Harry comforting an upset Hermione after she witnessed Ron snogging Lavender However, during an argument with his sister, Ginny mocked Ron about his inexperience with the opposite gender and told him that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum during their earlier romance. Ron subsequently began treating Hermione coldly, much to her bewilderment. She was upset when he and Lavender started flirting. When she found out about Ron's relationship with Lavender, she conjured a flock of wild birds to attack Ron for his insensitivity regarding her feelings. He became even angrier with her when she believed that Harry slipped Ron Felix Felicis to assist in his Quidditch-playing abilities; despite having believed it initially himself, he accused her of having no faith in him when it was discovered that he had not been slipped the potion at all.   After this, Hermione attended Slughorn's Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen to get back at Ron, but it did not go well due to the former's impoliteness. Afterwards, Ron (who was relieved that Hermione and McLaggen's date did not go well) attempted to speak to Hermione, but she ignored him, still upset and angry over his previous treatment of her.[35] This behaviour presisted for quite sometime.  Madam Pomfrey checking on a poisoned Ron, while Hermione, Harry, and Ginny are sitting by his bedside The two reconciled after Ron was hospitalised due to consuming poisoned mead, an event that left Hermione shaken and frightened. After the incident she remained unusually quiet and subdued. Whilst sitting at Ron's bedside, Ron subconsciously muttered Hermione's name. By this time, Ron was visibly\ndisillusioned with his relationship with Lavender, who had become possessive of him and called him by the annoying nickname \"Won-Won\". He was also pleased whenever Hermione visited him in the hospital wing.   He began avoiding Lavender, who soon became suspicious of his relationship with Hermione, ultimately leading to an argument about her. After Lavender saw Ron and Hermione come down alone from the boys' dormitories (Harry was present also, but under the invisibility cloak), she had a fight with Ron and broke up with him. When Ron told Harry and Hermione about breaking up with Lavender, Harry could have sworn he saw Hermione smirk.  Hermione and Ron discussing the Half-Blood Prince Afterwards, Hermione and Ron were more comfortable together, and their relationship improved considerably, although a romantic relationship remained out of their reach. Hermione comforted Ron after he failed his Apparition test because he Splinched half an eyebrow, while he teased her about the instructor's praise for her flawless performance. That year, Hermione also quickly mastered nonverbal magic, the first in her class to do so.   Throughout the year, Hermione and Ron were both sceptical of Harry's theory that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark and was up to something. Moreover, she was confident that Malfoy couldn't have brought any Dark objects into Hogwarts without alerting Filch. These claims were heard by Draco himself, who used these details and Hermione's previous plan of communication to accomplish his own.  A tearful Hermione standing at the base of the Astronomy Tower after Dumbledore's death Near the end of the school year, Harry's suspicions would be proven right. Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school by means of a pair of vanishing cabinets. One cabinet resided in Borgin and Burkes and the other in the Room of Hidden Things (as it had been presumed broken, but Malfoy managed to fix it). This infiltration of Death Eaters resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Hermione fought in the battle and remained unscathed thanks to some Felix Felicis.[35] This was a gift from Harry, who had won it in a Potions competition and had a preconceived notion of what was going to happen. He told Hermione, Ron, and Ginny to drink it beforehand in case his worries proved true.  The funeral of Albus Dumbledore Throughout the school year, Hermione and Ron had been informed of the content of Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore. Through these lessons Harry, and in turn Hermione and Ron, learned about the existence of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, who had been killed by Snape in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Hermione was comforted by Ron and cried on his shoulder. Afterwards, Harry told them about his desire to drop out of Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes, which were the key to defeating Lord Voldemort. Despite his protests, Hermione and Ron promised to forgo their seventh year of school in order to assist Harry. Before leaving the school, Hermione was able to Summon books about Horcruxes so as\nto learn how to destroy the items. She found them in Dumbledore's office, where the late headmaster had kept them after the subject had been banned at Hogwarts.  Hermione modifying her parents' memories Hermione began planning for her journey with Harry and Ron immediately. Concerned for the safety of her family, she altered her parents' memories to make them think they were Wendell and", "PPL": 0.20425567030906677, "PPL/lower": 0.2667986811578711, "PPL/zlib": 5.588390432532607e-05, "Min-5%": 3.8554133837129556, "Min-10%": 2.0265247411843315, "Min-20%": 1.0196518327740265, "Min-30%": 0.6803657802933651, "Min-40%": 0.5109761126921085, "Min-50%": 0.40866669835543823, "Min-60%": 0.34047065925321685}, {"text": ", father, and Sirius Black in attendance.[68] Harry spent his infancy in hiding with his parents in the Potter cottage.[32]  A young Harry having a jolly time on his toy broomstick For Harry's first birthday, Sirius bought him a toy broomstick. Lily's letter to Sirius mentioned that this broomstick had been Harry's favourite present and that he had smashed a horrible vase that had been a gift from Petunia and nearly killed their cat. In the letter, Lily also included a picture of Harry flying around on the broom and James chasing after him. Lily also stated in the letter that Harry looked pleased with himself while flying around on the toy broom. Lily and James also hosted a very quiet birthday tea. The only ones in attendance were them, Harry, and Bathilda Bagshot also used to dote on infant Harry. The Potters owned a cat, but what happened to it after Voldemort's attack it remains unknown.  Voldemort arriving at Godric's Hollow, planning to murder the infant Harry When it became clear that Voldemort marked the Potters for death in regards to the prophecy, Albus Dumbledore suggested that they use the Fidelius Charm to keep them safe. He even offered to be the Potter's Secret Keeper, but the Potters had already planned to make Sirius their Secret Keeper instead. On Sirius's advice, they changed this designation to Peter Pettigrew, who they thought would be less suspicious.[69] In a terrible turn of fate, Pettigrew was a Death Eater spy, and betrayed the Potters' whereabouts barely a week later.[70]  The Potter family home under attack, as Lily Potter was being murdered by Lord Voldemort On the evening of Hallowe'en in 1981, Lord Voldemort arrived at Godric's Hollow and murdered James and Lily. He murdered James first, who tried to distract the Dark Lord; unfortunately, he did not have his wand with him and was killed immediately. Voldemort then advanced on Lily, who died trying to protect Harry.[71] Her sacrifice prevented the Killing Curse from working on Harry, resulting in her love for Harry becoming a barrier to protecting him. When Voldemort attempted the curse on Harry, it backfired on the caster and instead of murdering Harry, Voldemort lost all his powers and his physical form was obliterated.  Harry as an infant facing death for the first time at the hands of Lord Voldemort Voldemort was saved from death by the five Horcruxes he had made up to that point, including his diary, Gaunt's ring, Slytherin's locket, Hufflepuff's cup, and Ravenclaw's diadem.[72] This later included Harry himself also, because a piece of Voldemort's unstable soul latched onto the only living being present. This gave him some of Voldemort's abilities such as the ability to speak Parseltongue. This event made Harry the only person to\nhave survived the Killing Curse, thus giving him the title the \"Boy Who Lived\". The failed curse left a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, marking him as Voldemort's equal. The scar would be both a bane and a blessing to Harry in the years to come, as it opened a telepathic link between Lord Voldemort and himself, giving each some awareness of each other's thoughts.  Rubeus Hagrid delivering baby Harry to 4 Privet Drive Rubeus Hagrid rescued Harry from the house, partially destroyed by Voldemort's faulty killing curse, and was given specific orders from Albus Dumbledore to take him to his aunt and uncle. As Hagrid left, he was intercepted by Sirius Black, a close friend of the Potters, who pleaded for Hagrid to give the baby to him, as he was the chosen guardian in the event of James and Lily's death. Hagrid refused, saying that he was under orders from Dumbledore to take Harry to his relatives. Sirius reluctantly relented and gave Hagrid his flying motorcycle to take Harry to Privet Drive, and left to find Pettigrew, who subsequently faked his death and framed Sirius for his death and that of twelve Muggles.[73]  Hagrid delivered Harry to Dumbledore late on the evening of 1 November 1981.[5] Dumbledore left a letter of explanation to the family living in the house, the Dursleys, who did not want to take care of Harry.[57]  On 1 September 1984, Albus Dumbledore mentioned Harry Potter's name at the Start-of-Term Feast to the residents of Hogwarts, telling them that he was safe, and that when old enough, he too would attend Hogwarts.[74]  Dumbledore leaving the infant Harry with a note at the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive As the Dursleys were Muggles, they could not use magic. They knew about its existence, but refused to associate with witches and wizards. They proudly considered themselves a \"normal\" family and despised anything out of the ordinary, even if it had nothing to do with witches, wizards, and magic. They lied to Harry about his parents' death, claiming they had died in a car crash. They also claimed that the lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead was from the same crash.[75] Whenever Harry tried to remember it, all that he could vaguely recall (as if he 'strained his memory') was a green flash of light and a high, cold laugh. He tried to understand what it was, or if it was from the car crash, but he simply could not. Petunia and Vernon Dursley, Harry's new guardians, forbade him from asking questions, particularly those regarding his parents. In addition, the Dursleys refused to have pictures of Lily and James, and did their best to avoid the subject of Harry's parents altogether.[76]  They resented Harry for his magic, which was sporadic but evident, and strongly discouraged any sort of imagination. They neglected Harry, verbally and emotionally abused him, and inflicted cruel punishments, like depriving him of meals and locking him into the cupboard under the stairs on him whenever something \"unusual\" occurred. Their behaviour was left unreported\nto authorities. In his youth, Harry could make strange things happen without understanding why he could, as no one had told him that he was a wizard.   For instance, after Petunia had sheared off all of his messy hair using a pair of kitchen scissors in her fury that it would not lay flat, leaving him almost completely bald with only the fringe at the front, it had grown all the way back, and to its previous messy state at that, by the next morning. Harry was punished, even though he had not done anything on purpose. Another time, Dedalus Diggle bowed to him in a shop, and Petunia furiously interrogated Harry as to know how he knew the man before leaving the shop hastily.[75]  Harry living in a cupboard beneath the staircase The Dursleys spoiled and pampered their son, Dudley, and paid almost no attention to Harry with what little attention they did pay to him being negative in its entirety. All his clothes were hand-me-downs from Dudley and were far too large for Harry. He was forced to sleep in the Cupboard Under the Stairs, while his cousin got two bedrooms to himself (one for sleeping in and one for storing all his toys). They also made Harry do household chores for them, such as making food and getting the post. In time, Dudley started bullying Harry. The Dursleys took Dudley and his friend Piers Polkiss to someplace spectacular every year for his birthday, but the only thing Harry ever got for his birthday was one of Vernon's old socks or a coat-hanger.  The Dursleys always hid evidence of Harry's existence by not having pictures of him in the house. Among the few people who did know about Harry were Petunia's friend Yvonne and Vernon's sister Marge, the latter of whom the boy was forced to consider an aunt to him, despite not being a relative of his. Aunt Marge showed the most dislike for the frail boy while visiting Privet Drive during Dudley Dursley's fifth birthday, when she whacked Harry around the shins to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues, and on holidays like Christmas, when she brought a computerised robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry to apparently eat.

They sat in the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge's luxury box as guests of the Minister, due to Lucius's large donation. He was seated directly behind trio and the Weasleys. He taunted Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger when a group of Death Eaters began terrorising the campers after the game, mocking the Muggles they were tormenting and implying that they would do the same to Hermione because of her Muggle-born status. Harry asked if his father (Lucius Malfoy) was participating in the riot and he responded with 'if they were, I wouldn't be likely to tell you', as the answer was yes. Once on the train to Hogwarts Draco proceeded to mock the trio about their lack of knowledge regarding the upcoming school event.[3]  Draco after\nunintentionally hitting Hermione with the Densaugeo hex during a short duel with Harry During his fourth year Hogwarts hosted the Triwizard Tournament, and, much to Draco's dismay and jealousy, Harry was chosen as a champion despite being too young. Draco supported Cedric Diggory, passing out badges that could be made to read Potter Stinks and taunting Harry regularly, such as commenting that he was betting Harry wouldn't last more than a few minutes with the dragons. He was proven wrong when Harry tied with Cedric for first place and succeeded in capturing his golden egg the fastest.[3]  He was also the informer and impetus behind Rita Skeeter writing slanderous, sensationalist articles about Harry, Hagrid and Hermione for the Daily Prophet, due to him knowing that she was an animagus; this assault on Harry's credibility would set the stage for widespread disbelief of Harry's announcement that Lord Voldemort had returned at the end of the school year. Some of the articles that he was partly for was one about Harry and Hermione titled Harry Potter's Secret Heartache.[3]  Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Professor Moody) scaring Draco Malfoy by transfiguring him into a ferret When Draco tried to cast a spell at Harry early in the year behind his back, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody using Polyjuice Potion) transformed Draco into a ferret and bounced him around the room as punishment. Although Professor McGonagall stopped it, Draco was very embarrassed and other students were highly amused; Ron dubbed him 'the Amazing Bouncing Ferret'. Throughout the year, students would tease Draco by telling him that Professor Moody was behind him, causing him to flinch or shudder. Even Hagrid noted that he had heard that Draco had made a good ferret, making Draco not know what to say. At Christmas time, Draco attended the Yule Ball with Pansy Parkinson.[3]  At the end of the year, Draco mocked Harry about his choice to side against Voldemort and also ridiculed Cedric Diggory's death. Before he could finish, however, he was hit by several curses from Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Fred and George Weasley.[3]  In 1995, Draco became a Slytherin prefect along with Pansy Parkinson. He was sure to mock Harry Potter for not receiving the same honour, as Gryffindor's prefects were Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. He also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song Weasley is Our King, which mocked Ron's Quidditch abilities as Gryffindor Keeper. It was the invention of this song, as well as insulting Molly and Arthur Weasley and the late Lily Potter to Harry, Fred, and George's faces that prompted Harry and George to get into a fight with Draco. They violently assaulted him, which resulted in the pair (as well as George's twin brother Fred) being banned from all further Quidditch matches, although their bans were later lifted after Dolores Umbridge's sacking from Hogwarts and her being put on suspension for her actions.[18]  Malfoy joining Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad Later that year, he joined Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, and\nclearly enjoyed the power this gave him over other students. He held this power over Harry and his friends especially. All of the Squad members were Slytherins, as Umbridge was bias and favoured students of her former house. Draco caught Harry running out of the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army, receiving fifty house points, for Slytherin, from Umbridge.[18]  Later, he was among the Inquisitorial Squad members who caught Harry and his friends in their attempt to discover the whereabouts of Sirius Black, whom Harry had seen being tortured in a vision, planted by Lord Voldemort. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood were all brought to Umbridge's office, guarded by the Inquisitorial Squad. Before Umbridge could carry through on her threat to use the Cruciatus Curse to make Harry talk, Hermione told Umbridge that they were trying to contact Albus Dumbledore about a 'weapon' that he planned to use against the Ministry of Magic. Draco had an expression of 'eagerness and greed' at this news that convinced Umbridge not to allow him or any other Squad member to accompany her as she took Harry and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest in search of the alleged weapon.[18]  The Inquisitorial Squad holding several D.A. members hostage for Umbridge After Umbridge left, the remaining D.A. (Dumbledore's Army) members used a litany of Stunning Spells and Disarming Charms to escape the office; Draco was hit by Ginny's Bat-Bogey Hex. It was soon revealed that Hermione had been lying about a weapon; Umbridge was carried off by centaurs and the six D.A. members flew to the Ministry, where the Battle of the Department of Mysteries ensued.[18]  Draco's father was seen participating in the battle as a Death Eater and was imprisoned in Azkaban for his crimes. Draco was very upset by this, and mainly blamed Harry, swearing vengeance and attempting to attack him at the end of the school year with the help of Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. However, other D.A. members came to Harry's defence, resulting in Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle ending up looking like ugly slug-like things after being hit by a number of hexes by all D.A. Members at the same time.[18]  Draco talking to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini on the Hogwarts Express about his mission from Voldemort By late 1996, Draco joined the Death Eaters, having replaced his incarcerated father. He bragged about having been given a mission to his fellow Slytherin students on his way to school on the Hogwarts Express. However, as the year dragged on, Draco became increasingly afraid that he would fail in his seemingly impossible task \u2014 to kill Albus Dumbledore. It is implied that Draco was expected to fail and that Voldemort assigned him the task with the intention of punishing Lucius Malfoy for his failure at the Department of Mysteries.   The safety of his family rested on Draco's success with his mission. When Harry overhead some parts of Draco's conversation with his fellow Slytherins about the mission, Draco used a Full Body-Bind Curse to paralyse\nHarry and stomped hard on his face, crushing his nose, in revenge for imprisoning his father, Lucius, causing Harry to hate Draco more than ever, while disregarding what Harry heard as not important enough to condemn him.[19]  Draco planned to repair a Vanishing Cabinet that Peeves had destroyed four years previously, in order to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts to assist him in killing Dumbledore. In his previous year at Hogwarts a fellow Slytherin, Graham Montague, had been forced into it by the Weasley twins and later managed to apparate out as a last resort to free himself from the limbo-like space into which he had vanished.

He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and the elder brother of Ginny. Ron and his siblings lived at The Burrow, on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole, Devon.  Ron began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He soon became close friends with\nfellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger. Together, they made the Golden Trio and faced many challenges during their adolescence, including keeping the Philosopher's Stone from Professor Quirinus Quirrell, rescuing Ginny from the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, saving Harry's godfather Sirius Black from the Dementors of Azkaban, and guiding Harry through the Triwizard Tournament.  He also helped form Dumbledore's Army and fought in numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War. These battles included the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and Battle of the Seven Potters (1997). Ron also became a Gryffindor prefect and a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his fifth year at Hogwarts.  He skipped his last year of school in order to accompany Harry and Hermione on a hunt to destroy all of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, during which he lost his brother Fred, a loss which devastated him and his family, especially George, Fred's twin.  After the war, Ron became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the British Ministry of Magic.[27] After two years as an Auror, he went to work at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with his brother George. He and Hermione eventually married and had two children, Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. Ron was also named the godfather of James Sirius Potter, his sister Ginny Weasley's and Harry Potter's eldest child.  Ronald Bilius Weasley was born 1 March 1980, to Arthur and Molly Weasley (n\u00e9e Prewett),[11] at the height of the First Wizarding War. During this war his maternal uncles Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both members of the Order of the Phoenix, were murdered while fighting a group of four Death Eaters led by Antonin Dolohov.[7] While he was still a toddler, the war ended for a time after Lord Voldemort's first defeat at the hands of Ron's classmate-to-be Harry Potter on the 31 October 1981.  Ron and his five older brothers \u2014 Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George \u2014 as well as his younger sister, Ginny, grew up in The Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and simple mathematics by his mother. The Weasley family was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families.[28] Many other pure-blood families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"blood traitor\" beliefs and lack of wealth. They tried their best to make up for this with their love.[29]  The Weasley siblings, especially Fred and George, were fond of teasing and playing pranks on each other, and Ron was a particular target for Fred and George. They once Transfigured Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia. On another occasion, the twins nearly got him to make an Unbreakable Vow, which finally made their father truly furious (and Fred would later state that his left buttock has \"never been the same since\" after the row that ensued). They also once got him to eat an Acid\nPop which burnt a hole through his tongue.  When Ron was younger, he had a pet rat named Scabbers, whom he had inherited from Percy.

The original Order of the Phoenix, her allies Hermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, when she, Harry and Ron spent several weeks at the Order's headquarters. Through her time at Grimmauld Place, Hermione got to know Alastor Moody, the most famous Auror of modern times, known for rounding up several Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War and for his growing paranoia. He and Hermione fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and later, in the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Moody was killed by Voldemort's own hand. Hermione, like the rest of the Order, was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror, \"the consummate survivor,\"[10] and disgusted by Mundungus Fletcher's desertion. Hermione, who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after Sirius Black's death, aside from being a member of the Order, took part in interrogating Fletcher, when she, Harry and Ron realised Salazar Slytherin's Locket had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place.  Hermione had great respect for Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror and eventual Minister for Magic, who was known as \"Royal\" on Potterwatch, and who saved countless lives (including Hermione, Ron and Harry's) when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding the Burrow. Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother. Though Hermione, Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the Hog's Head Pub, they finally met him in 1998, just before the Battle of Hogwarts, when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by Death Eaters. Prior to that, he sent Dobby to rescue them, along with Dean Thomas, Luna\nLovegood, Garrick Ollivander and Griphook the Goblin, from the Malfoy Manor; as it turned out, Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black's two-way mirror from Mundungus Fletcher, and been keeping an eye out for Harry.  Nymphadora Tonks, a funny, Metamorphmagus witch, who had become a good friend of Hermione's, died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order, Remus Lupin, during the Battle of Hogwarts. As their son, Ted Lupin, was Harry's godson and was also dating Hermione's niece, Victoire by 2017, it's likely Hermione remained quite close to him.  Albus Dumbledore, her former headmaster As with most aspects of the wizarding world, Hermione read about Albus Dumbledore shortly after learning that she was a witch. Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to. She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school, in 1991, and quickly came to respect Dumbledore's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with Harry Potter, he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with Ron Weasley, trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.  He respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows. Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed, and visited his portrait with Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts to determine the fate of the Hallows.  Rubeus Hagrid, her friend and professor Rubeus Hagrid was the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts, as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Since Hagrid had met Harry Potter prior to the start of Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed, eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Harry and Ron Weasley. In their second year, Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a \"a filthy little mudblood\" by Draco Malfoy.   Though she disapproved of Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron, as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half-brother Grawp. In turn, it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re-think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry's new Firebolt confiscated in their third year. When Dolores Umbridge threatened Hagrid's job during the 1995-1996 school year, Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.  Hagrid remained close to the\ntrio throughout their time at Hogwarts, and fought various battles in the course of the Second Wizarding War. In 2017, Harry's sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that Hermione and Ron's daughter would have been joining them.  Remus Lupin, her professor and friend Hermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Hermione deduced he was a werewolf during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry, Ron and Hermione whilst in the Shrieking Shack. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help Sirius Black kill Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort.   However, thanks to Harry's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. Hermione, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.  Hermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. She and Lupin both fought against the Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and survived (despite Hermione being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven Potters began, and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin's son, Ted Lupin, being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage. Hermione was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' deaths in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, Teddy Lupin, later on in life.  Minerva McGonagall, her Head of House and professor Professor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in her house one of her \"rare smiles\" when Hermione successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for Hermione, and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the troll that entered the school in 1991 on her own, in order to cover up for Harry and Ron.

Charlie was disappointed when Duncan left before he had a chance to ask about the dragon.[26]  In the Buried Vault, when the Hungarian Horntail was out of its portrait, the students there were all terrified, although Charles Weasley was happy and amazed because of seeing this dangerous breed of dragon.[27]  Charlie wearing his Quidditch captain badge Charlie eventually became Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team[28] at some point in his fifth year or later.[29] After he left Hogwarts, the Seeker position for the Gryffindor Quidditch team was taken by Harry Potter and the Quidditch Captain position was taken by Keeper Oliver Wood.  Early in his sixth year, Charlie considered dropping out of Hogwarts due to what had happened in the Buried Vault in the previous school year. However, Jacob's sibling convinced him to finish his education.[30]  Charlie as a member of the Circle of Khanna Sometime during the year, Charlie became a founding member of the Circle of Khanna, a group devoted to avenging Rowan Khanna and locating the final Cursed Vault. It was at the groups first meeting in the Hog's Head Inn that he learned of the malevolent organisation \"R\" and it's motives to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.[31]  Charlie that year also met with Jacob's sibling in the Three Broomsticks Inn and agreed to help them talk with the ghost of Duncan Ashe in the Prefects' Bathroom for information about their brother. Ashe told them both in the bathroom that he and Jacob often spent time in the Boathouse, when they then searched for information, eventually finding a letter written to Jacob's sibling from Jacob concealed as a Black Quill.[32]  Charlie took his Apparition test twice. He failed on the first attempt, materialising five miles south of his target location on top of an old woman doing her shopping. He passed on the second attempt. His brothers Fred and George made fun of this, but not to his face.[33]  He achieved at least one N.E.W.T., having earned an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Care of Magical Creatures.[34]  Prior to his graduation, Charlie was given a Quidditch Trophy.[35]  The Romanian Dragon Sanctuary where Charlie works After leaving school, Charlie went to Romania to study dragons.[13] At some point, he acquired a new wand, and his old wand was passed down to his youngest brother, Ron.[15] However, many\nof his peers believed that, had he chosen to, he could have played Quidditch professionally and would have been good enough to play for the English national side.[36]  At Christmas in 1991, Charlie was visited by his parents and his sister, Ginny.[37] During the early part of 1992, Charlie received a letter from Ron, asking for help in getting rid of a baby dragon Rubeus Hagrid acquired off a man in a pub. The dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback named Norbert, was being illegally kept, but Ron \u2014 along with his friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger \u2014 did not want their friend to get into trouble. Charlie, who had always got on well with Hagrid because of their shared love of dragons, agreed to help and arranged for some of his friends to pick up Norbert and deliver him to the dragon sanctuary in Romania where he worked.[38]  Charlie with his family in Egypt in 1993 In 1993, Charlie joined the rest of his family for a holiday in Egypt after his father won seven hundred galleons in the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.[39]  Bill and Charlie joust with tables at the Burrow  During the summer of 1994, Charlie returned to the Burrow to attend the Quidditch World Cup with the rest of his family. He also met Harry Potter for the first time.[40] During the Death Eater disturbance in the aftermath of the Irish victory, Charlie, along with his father, Bill, and Percy assisted the Ministry in attempting to stop it.[41] Charlie stayed at the Burrow for the summer and accompanied his siblings, Harry, and Hermione to King's Cross Station to see them off to Hogwarts on 1 September.[42] Charlie helps deliver the dragons for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament During the Triwizard Tournament, which took place in the 1994\u20131995 school year, Charlie assisted in bringing nesting mother dragons to Hogwarts for use in the First Task. They were transported over using a Sleeping Draught, and he did not dare tell his mother about them considering that she was still angry about Harry being allowed to compete in the Tournament.[43] He remained on hand during the Task in case the dragons got out of hand, and congratulated Harry on beating the Hungarian Horntail.[44] He relayed Harry's performance to Bill, saying it was \"incredible.\" He attempted to get time off of work to attend the Third Task, but was unable to.[45]  When Albus Dumbledore reconstituted the Order of the Phoenix to oppose Lord Voldemort, Charlie joined alongside his family. While his brother Bill returned to England to better serve the Order, Charlie remained in Romania and was assigned to recruit foreign wizards to the cause.[46]  Bill and Fleur's wedding that Charlie attended as the best man In the summer of 1997, Charlie once more returned to the Burrow, to serve as best man at Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour.[47] During a birthday celebration for Harry the day before the wedding, he informed Hagrid that Norbert was doing well \u2014 and was now\ncalled Norberta since they had discovered, to Hagrid's surprise, that the dragon was actually a female.[48]  When the wedding was broken up by Death Eaters in the wake of the fall of the Ministry of Magic,[49] he was questioned alongside his family but was unharmed. He presumably returned to Romania, as both his father and brothers were allowed to return to work.  Charlie and others arrive for the second half of the Battle of Hogwarts While the rest of the Weasley family answered Neville Longbottom's call to arms to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, Charlie did not join them immediately. This was possibly due to being out of the country at the time. During this time, his younger brother Fred was tragically killed during the first half of the battle. This was something Charlie was initially unaware of, as he was not present during the one-hour armistice.[50]  However, he did arrive toward the end of the battle alongside Horace Slughorn. He and Horace lead hundreds of reinforcements consisting of the residents of Hogsmeade and the friends and family of all the Hogwarts students who had chosen to stay and fight Voldemort and his Death Eater army. These reinforcements changed the tide of the battle in the favour of the Defenders of Hogwarts.[51]  Charlie and the other defenders of Hogwarts watch Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort Arriving just as Neville slayed Nagini, he led them into battle against Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters, strengthening the weakened defenders of the castle. With the added fighters the defenders of Hogwarts were able to push Voldemort's army back, until only Bellatrix and the Dark Lord himself were the only two left. He also witnessed his mother killing Bellatrix Lestrange and Harry defeating and killing Lord Voldemort once and for all.[51] It can be assumed that after the battle ended he sat with his family and mourned Fred as well as the others that had fallen.  Following the war, Charlie did not marry or have children, as he was more interested in studying dragons than in forming a romantic attachment. However, he had many nieces and nephews through all of his living siblings.   As of the summer of 2014, he was still unmarried, which prompted the nosy journalist Rita Skeeter to wonder what the reasons behind his prolonged celibacy were.[52]  An older Charlie In 2019, a Magizoologist member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force visited the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary to study dragons, where they ended up being grouped together with Charlie. While there, Charlie held a course that would allow them to spot weaknesses in dragon's hide, which would later help them in the field during the Calamity,[53] along with aiding them in their study of the creatures to increase the amount of damage they could deal in combat.

Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made, and cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know.   Hermione was challenged in more ways than one that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione. However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.[31]  Hermione practising with Dumbledore's Army in the Room of Requirement Meanwhile, it was not long before Hermione realised that the Ministry of Magic had decided to interfere at Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a cruel, falsely sweet Ministry employee with a personality like \"poisoned honey\", was appointed as the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts and Hermione, like Harry and Ron, disliked Umbridge for many reasons, one of which being that she refused to teach students practical defence, focusing only on theory, despite their OWLs being later that year.   With this being the case, Hermione decided that Hogwarts needed a competent teacher and, together with Harry and Ron, founded Dumbledore's Army, a secret organisation in which students would gather after classes and be taught practical defensive spells. She suggested that Harry be the teacher; though he originally thought the idea ridiculous, he consented to teach the class. The name was suggested by Ginny, who recalled the conversation they'd had about Fudge's greatest fear being that Dumbledore would form an army of students if the Ministry did not intervene at Hogwarts.  Hermione conjuring her otter Patronus One of the many advanced spells Hermione learned was the Patronus Charm; hers took the corporeal form of an otter.[23] Hermione became one of the few people brave enough to call Voldemort by his actual name. However, Hermione made the mistake of arranging the first meeting to take place in the Hog's Head, as opposed to the Three Broomsticks, which Sirius, appearing in the Gryffindor Common Room fire, said would have made it a lot harder for anyone to overhear. Willy Widdershins, who was in the Hog's Head, went to Umbridge, who instituted Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four to forbid any type of students groups from being formed under her watchful eye.  The trio and Ginny in St Mungo's after visiting Arthur Weasley Halfway through the year at Hogwarts, Harry had a vision of Voldemort's snake, Nagini, biting Mr Weasley during his task for the Order of the Phoenix. Mr Weasley was carried into St Mungo's Hospital, where Mrs Weasley screamed at him for trying to stitch his wound instead of healing it with magic.   Hermione was one of the few who visited him and stayed at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place for a couple of weeks until Mr Weasley was nursed back to health. Hermione had managed to convince her parents by telling them that skiing wasn't really her thing and that people who were serious about their exams stayed at Hogwarts and studied.  The trio in the Gryffindor common\nroom having a discussion about recent events The D.A. brought Harry into greater contact with Cho Chang. After a meeting, Harry kissed Cho, and when he returned to the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione immediately guessed, asking if Cho had cornered him after the meeting. When Harry told them that Cho has been crying, she explained to Harry and Ron that Cho was having a hard time since Cedric Diggory, who she used to go out with, was killed by Lord Voldemort. Hermione later gave Harry advice on Cho and girls in general.   In an effort to combat the lies being told about Harry, Hermione arranged for an interview during a Hogsmeade visit with Rita Skeeter to be printed in The Quibbler telling his side of the story, blackmailing Skeeter into penning it in a sympathetic tone. Despite being banned \u2014 or maybe because it was banned \u2014 it became the magazine's best-selling issue of all time.[31]  It was Hermione's brilliant spell-work that ensured the security of Dumbledore's Army. She created coins enchanted with the Protean Charm, an advanced spell, as a method of communication, and jinxed the club's attendance sheet to give any tattler a horrendous rash on the face, which would spell out \"SNEAK\" in painful boils. This is exactly what happened to Marietta Edgecombe, a reluctant member of the D.A., having been brought to the meetings by Cho. Shortly before Easter, Marietta finally caved under the pressure from her ministry mother who worked in the the Floo Network Office and betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge. When Harry learned that they could not find a counter-curse to heal her face, he swelled with pride at Hermione's jinxing ability.  Hermione and Neville Longbottom being held against their will by the Inquisitorial Squad Dobby the house-elf learned of this turn of events and rushed to the Room of Requirement to warn Harry and the D.A. They immediately scattered, and most members escaped, but Harry was caught by Umbridge and several Slytherin students who were members of the Inquisitorial Squad. A search of the room uncovered the parchment that each member of the D.A. had signed, headed Dumbledore's Army. Finally having \"proof\" that Dumbledore was building an army to challenge the Ministry, Umbridge immediately contacted Cornelius Fudge. Dumbledore fled the school and Umbridge became Headmistress. Hermione was not exposed at that time, but later she was brought to Umbridge's office by the some members of the Inquisitorial Squad.  Late in the fall of that year, Hagrid, who had been missing for the entirety of the school year, returned to Hogwarts. Hermione, Harry, and Ron ventured down to see him immediately even though it was after curfew. Hermione was aghast at the injuries Hagrid had sustained and greatly curious as to his story. Hagrid told the trio about his mission with Madame Maxime to try and recruit the giants in the fight against Voldemort. They were almost caught when Umbridge called on Hagrid that night, but hid under the Invisibilty Cloak.   Hermione forcefully telling Grawp to put her\ndown Months later, Hermione and Harry learned why Hagrid was perpetually bruised and cut; he had brought his giant half-brother Grawp back to Hogwarts, as he was getting severely bullied, and was trying to teach him human ways. After Grawp, who had the mental age of a human toddler, picked her up, Hermione forcefully told him to put him down. He subsequently became enamoured with Hermione, calling her \"Hermy\". It was one of the few words he could pronounce.   Just after their class took their O.W.L.s, Harry had a vision of his godfather being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Hermione was worried that it was a trap and convinced Harry to try to contact Sirius before doing anything rash. To that end, she accompanied Harry in an act of solidarity as he sneaked into Umbridge's office to use the Floo Network, with the assistance of Ron, Ginny, and Luna Lovegood, but they were ultimately caught. When Umbridge threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry during questioning, Hermione interceded. She came up with a lie that she and her fellow D.A. members had been building a weapon for Dumbledore, thus stopping Umbridge's sadistic interrogation and attempted torture of Harry.  Hermione and Harry lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest Hermione successfully lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest by saying that's where the weapon was hidden, where Umbridge was carried away by a herd of centaurs. She had predicted that the centaurs would let her and Harry go, since they did not insult the centaurs and were young enough to be considered \"foals\". However, the centaurs were already enraged by Umbridge and were further angered when Hermione admitted that she had hoped that they would drive Umbridge off, being insulted that they were thought of to do the bidding of humans. The centaurs were about to carry the two students off as well, but Grawp stumbled onto the scene and a fight broke out between the giant and the herd. This allowed Hermione and Harry to escape and meet up with Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville, who had escaped from the Inquisitorial Squad.  After a brief argument between Harry and Neville over whether or not the others were going to travel with Harry to London, an understanding was reached.

Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Tom Riddle, the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends.   Although they had very little direct contact, Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar: both are \"model students\" who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her\nseventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family.  Bellatrix Lestrange, a hated enemy Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort's most fanatically loyal followers; Hermione initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Longbottom, though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Sirius Black at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in 1996.  During the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a \"blood traitor,\" Ron Weasley was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Godric Gryffindor's Sword. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word \"mudblood\" on Hermione's arm,[68] as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse.[10] Hermione later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. She expressed disgust at having to  use Bellatrix's wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix committed with it. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by Molly Weasley, who eventually killed Bellatrix herself, avenging Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, Nymphadora Tonks, and Dobby the house-elf in the process, among others.  Draco Malfoy, her school bully Draco Malfoy, of an old and wealthy pure-blood family with Death Eater ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and thus treated Hermione with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron, who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Draco in school marks, for which his father berated him.[4] Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term \"Mudblood,\" which usually set off the tempers of her friends \u2014 and the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992[4] \u2014 but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same.   Occasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak, for which Draco was largely responsible.[33]  In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione, Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998, avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences, Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Albus Potter.[10] He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Draco's civility\ntowards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister for Magic in Britain at the time, and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius.  Pansy Parkinson Pansy Parkinson was more or less Hermione's polar opposite: where Hermione was compassionate (as seen when she founded SPEW), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as Hagrid), and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy's more sycophantic lackeys. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione, Harry, and Ron at any given opportunity, though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Harry to Lord Voldemort shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a \"cow\", and \"thicker than a concussed troll\".[31]  Rita Skeeter While covering the Triwizard Tournament in Hermione's fourth year, Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Harry Potter and his friends, including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half-giant. Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this. After Hermione insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and Viktor Krum. This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus.  Hermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task. Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle. Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.  When the Ministry of Magic began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Harry, Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita, this time into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again. Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Hermione during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt, it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Hermione's wrath 19 years following her being blackmailed by the prodigious witch.  Dumbledore's Army, her allies Dumbledore's Army was essentially Hermione's brainchild, though she co-founded it with Ron and Harry during the 1995\u20131996 school year. After Dolores Umbridge\ninformed her Defence Against the Dark Arts students that they would not be using any magic, claiming a theoretical education would suffice, a furious Hermione (fearful of being ill-equipped to deal with the reborn Lord Voldemort and the upcoming O.W.L.s) conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so. Though the secret classes were taught by Harry, Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the Hog's Head, created the DA's method of covert communication, and jinxed their member list to reveal any betrayal.   All of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year (with the exceptions of Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and later Zacharias Smith, who deserted them), as evidenced by their reunion in 1997, and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Moreover, the DA truly cemented Hermione's friendships with Luna Love", "PPL": 0.1976335048675537, "PPL/lower": 0.33802503885400936, "PPL/zlib": 5.4489524363814095e-05, "Min-5%": 3.898985561494734, "Min-10%": 1.9733832221679097, "Min-20%": 0.9876965565008081, "Min-30%": 0.6585357951556624, "Min-40%": 0.4944733392953455, "Min-50%": 0.39543396966893296, "Min-60%": 0.32943632231554476}, {"text": "ambush of Delphini in Godric's Hollow on 31st October 1981, that he was both astounded and mildly enjoying taking battle commands from Hermione, finding the situation darkly amusing.  Neville Longbottom, his former enemy and whom he used to bully The initially shy and clumsy Neville regularly found himself on the receiving end of insults from Draco and his gang, and was often the butt of their jokes and pranks -- a fact which served only to make Neville clumsier and less confident. Encouraged by Hermione, Ron, and Harry to stand up for himself, Neville grew to be someone who was much more difficult to bully by his later years at Hogwarts, resisting not only the Slytherin students, but also Alecto and Amycus Carrow and Severus Snape. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Neville proved to have made an impressive and complete turn around from his earlier years of crumbling under Draco's bullying, when he openly defied Lord Voldemort and beheaded Nagini, effectively destroying Voldemort's final Horcrux.  Draco and Neville were fourth cousins, but both of them did not know about this relationship.  Albus Dumbledore, his former headmaster Draco showed particular dislike for the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who was in favour of complete acceptance of Muggle-borns, a contradictory view to that of the Malfoys'. As such, Draco often ridiculed Dumbledore's ideals and choices. He was excited at first when given the mission to kill Dumbledore, with the desire to redeem his family name and avenge his father, even daring to use the derogatory term 'Mudblood' in front of the Headmaster, the latter of which displeased Dumbledore. However, Dumbledore pitied Draco when he became a Death Eater, as he knew that Voldemort had forced Draco to his bidding by threatening Draco's parents. Furthermore, when Dumbledore offered to save Draco from the Death Eaters, Draco seemed inclined to accept the offer before the exchange was interrupted by the arrival of his fellow Death Eaters. When Draco witnessed Snape killing Dumbledore, he appeared horrified, which\nlikely compounded his regret of ever becoming a Death Eater.  Also before his fourth year, Draco referred to Dumbledore as a Mudblood-lover.[3]  Dolores Umbridge, his former D.A.D.A. professor Accustomed to the preferential treatment he received from Severus Snape, and reaping the benefits of his family's connections and status, Draco tried to use his grandfather's good name to get close to Horace Slughorn, though Slughorn did little more than ignore him. However, Dolores Umbridge, who was familiar with Draco's father, made Draco and his friends members of the Inquisitorial Squad, and was quick to allow the Slytherin Quidditch team to re-form after she disbanded every other 'Student Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club' with Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four.  Draco showed contempt for the teachers who lacked status or didn't fit his or his family's standards of blood purity, such as Remus Lupin, who was a Werewolf and consequently tended to look ragged and poor; Rubeus Hagrid, an unkempt half-giant; and Alastor Moody (Barty Crouch, Jnr in disguise), who was an Auror known for the extensive list of Death Eaters he had captured, as well as his intense paranoia. Draco refrained from being too openly contemptuous toward the ex-auror due to fear. Incidentally, during the Ministry's smear campaign against Dumbledore, the same three teachers were cited as 'eccentric decisions' made by Dumbledore, and evidence of his diminishing competence in the position Headmaster. Draco often found himself at odds with Head of Gryffindor House Professor McGonagall, who never played favourites with any student, least of all Malfoy, though he showed her some level of grudging respect, while she did not accept Harry's accusations of Draco's crimes without sufficient evidence. Draco similarly seemed to feel some respect toward Filius Flitwick. Draco also disliked the caretaker Argus Filch because he was a Squib and never hesitated to punish Draco, although they did work together in the Inquisitorial Squad.  Myrtle Warren During Draco's second year, when the Chamber of Secrets was opened a second time, Draco jeered to the disguised Harry and Ron that the first time the Chamber was opened, a Mudblood died \u2014 that 'Mudblood' being Myrtle.  During Draco's sixth year, when he was assigned by Lord Voldemort to kill Albus Dumbledore, he became stressed out from the difficulty of the mission and the consequences of failure. Surprisingly, despite Draco's prejudice against Muggle-borns, Draco apparently visited Myrtle regularly in a bathroom, where he confided in and even openly cried in front of her. In turn, she was under the impression that Draco was a sensitive boy who was being bullied (which was true, though Myrtle would not have known Lord Voldemort was the one bullying him). This may be one of the rare moments that Draco showed something other than disgust for Muggle-borns, though it is unknown whether he was aware of Myrtle's blood status and connection to the Chamber of Secrets' opening during Voldemort's time at Hogwarts.  Lord Voldemort, his former master and former idol turned enemy Although Draco originally admired and respected Lord Voldemort, he came to fear\nhim after having his family's safety threatened.  Draco joined the Death Eaters at age sixteen, when Lord Voldemort threatened to kill his parents if he failed in his mission to assassinate Albus Dumbledore. In fact, Voldemort wanted to punish Lucius Malfoy for not retrieving a Prophecy from the Department of Mysteries in his assumption that Draco would fail and have to be punished accordingly. Draco fought in several battles for Voldemort, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. After Voldemort's final defeat, Draco was not imprisoned, as he and his family had deserted the Death Eaters prior to Voldemort's defeat.  Although it is unknown if Draco ever learnt this, it was ironically his act in disarming Dumbledore before his death and unknowingly mastering the Elder Wand which prevented Voldemort from fully mastering the wand's power. Draco, in turn, was disarmed by Harry of his wand during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, thereby giving Harry mastery of the Elder Wand. When Harry told Voldemort these facts, the latter simply dismissed them, arguing that they made no difference and that Voldemort threatened to 'attend to [i.e., kill]' Draco, likely as punishment not only for Draco's unintentional meddling but also for Draco's parents' disloyalty to Voldemort. Fortunately for the Malfoys, this arrogant indifference ultimately resulted in his final defeat at the hands of Harry Potter.  By 2020, Draco had become so disillusioned from the Death Eater cause due to his experiences with Voldemort that he (Draco) helped the Trio defeat Voldemort's daughter Delphini in her plan to save Voldemort from his first downfall back in 1981. What was rather remarkable about Draco's involvement in this escapade was that Delphini was the illegitimate daughter of Draco's aunt Bellatrix, and therefore Draco's cousin. This defiance of Delphini and Voldemort demonstrated that Draco wanted so little to do with his erstwhile master that even having the Dark Lord's daughter being a blood relative was a repugnant notion to him. Draco also might have been motivated by a desire to redeem himself from his Death Eater past. During this period in his life, Draco also began referring to Voldemort by his name rather than the 'Dark Lord' as he did in his youth, which might have been motivated by his self-redemption.

Hagrid was also devastated by Dumbledore's death in 1997. He was also right about telling Harry that Snape was on Dumbledore's side. Hagrid in return greatly admired and trusted Dumbledore and took extreme offence to anyone who dared insult the Headmaster.  Minerva McGonagall: his friend, colleague, and former student Minerva McGonagall knew Dumbledore for the majority of her life. She attended Hogwarts as a student during Dumbledore's time as the Transfiguration Professor and later went on to replace him when he took the position of Head of the school. She served for many years as his Deputy Headmistress, standing in for him and even replacing him as standing Headmistress on several occasions.[46][47]  Minerva had great faith in Dumbledore, placing great stock in the differences between him and Voldemort.[8] However, she did not hesitate to disagree with him when she felt the need to do so. She was extremely opposed to his decision to place Harry Potter with his narrow-minded Muggle aunt and uncle, saying that \"You couldn't find two people who are less like us.\"[10] She also served more than once to bring Dumbledore back on track when he became distracted from the matter currently at hand.[58]  Dumbledore discovered Minerva in tears in her classroom late one evening, after she found out about the marriage of a young love to another woman. She confessed the whole story to him and Albus Dumbledore offered both comfort and wisdom, telling Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between two intensely private and reserved characters were to form the basis of a lasting mutual esteem and friendship.  Minerva had no qualms about displaying her loyalty to Dumbledore. When Cornelius Fudge brought Aurors to arrest Dumbledore in 1996, she boldly stepped forward and announced her intention to fight the Aurors on his behalf. She only stepped back at Dumbledore's insistence when he reminded her that Hogwarts and her students would need her in his absence.[62]  Minerva was devastated when Dumbledore was killed in 1997 during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and attended his funeral.[46] A year later, when Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts on a mission given to him by Dumbledore, she did not question the decision of her dead friend, but immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could.[28]  Severus Snape, a trusted ally, colleague, and former student Snape's relationship with Dumbledore was one of close, but\nnot indefinite trust. After indirectly and accidentally sending Voldemort after Lily, Snape turned to Dumbledore to keep her safe. Dumbledore was initially scornful towards Snape for his Death Eater affiliations and openly disgusted when the man confessed a selfish willingness to let Lily's family perish so he could have her to himself, but eventually agreed to capitalise on Snape's remorse and initiated him into the Order of the Phoenix as a double agent.  As a spy for the Order, Snape silently kept his place within the ranks of the Death Eaters, while informing Dumbledore about their movements. He also adopted the role of secret agent for Voldemort and supplied him with strategic scraps of information about the Order. The content of these reports was often dictated by Dumbledore. It is implied that Snape withheld little, if any, information from Dumbledore that was relevant to the Order's success, while Snape deliberately did the opposite for Voldemort.  \"I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus...\" It is notable that Dumbledore did not confide completely in Snape, thereby minimising the potential damage that might occur if Snape was compromised. Snape resented Dumbledore's secrecy, and was offended by this lack of faith in his abilities. However, when Snape discovered that he had been used as a pawn in Harry's own destruction, he was horrified, seeing it as a calculated betrayal of Lily's memory.  Dumbledore clearly underestimated Snape's capacity for love, and years later was very surprised to learn that Snape still maintained his devotion. Furthermore, he complimented Snape's bravery, stating he was far braver than Igor Karkaroff and that sometimes they sorted too soon, leaving Snape dumbstruck. But in contrast to this, Dumbledore overestimated Snape's feelings to get over \"old grudges\" and therefore assigned him to tutor Harry in Occlumency, which ended badly between the two parties.   In 1996, Dumbledore was cursed by putting on Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which was a Horcrux (he put it on when he was distracted by finding out that it was the Resurrection Stone, hoping to talk to his dead family). He managed to contact Severus who was able to contain the curse in his right hand. However, Snape knew and told Dumbledore that the curse would get stronger and stronger and eventually kill him painfully, giving him a prognosis of about a year. By this time, Dumbledore was aware of Voldemort's plan to kill him through assigning Draco Malfoy by threatening to kill his parents. Knowing that he was going to die in a year and to save Draco Malfoy's safety and his soul, he begged Snape to give him a quick and painless death when the time came. Snape, although resistant at first to killing Dumbledore, carried it out at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when Draco Malfoy had managed to bring Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Dumbledore also entrusted Snape with protecting the students once Hogwarts fell into Voldemort's control.  It is notable that despite trusting Snape had reformed, Dumbledore never allowed him his coveted position of professor of Defence\nAgainst the Dark Arts, ostensibly under the concern that it would cause him to revert to \"old habits\". However, it is more likely that he did it out of a desire to protect Snape from the jinx he believed Lord Voldemort had put on the job after failing to acquire the position himself. This same jinx prevented any teacher from lasting more than twelve months at the post, sometimes with fatal results. After being cursed by Marvolo Gaunt's ring and ordering Snape to kill him, Dumbledore finally granted him the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, knowing that if Snape were to kill him, he would be vilified by the wizarding public and forced to abandon the post.  Elphias Doge, his friend for many years Elphias Doge became a close friend of Dumbledore's during their first day at Hogwarts. Elphias suffered from Dragon Pox, and everybody avoided him. Elphias thought Dumbledore was a very great wizard, and a very great person, and believed that his many early losses endowed him with great humanity and strong sympathy, as he stated in an obituary he wrote for Albus Dumbledore, after his death.  Elphias pitied Dumbledore about his father, mother, and sister, and had a highly opinion of him. Elphias soon became a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation that Dumbledore had led. He also attended Albus Dumbledore's funeral.  Elphias also told Harry to never believe Rita Skeeter and Muriel's slanders about Albus Dumbledore's family life, including that Ariana was a Squib. It is possible that Elphias Doge fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, his former students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were Harry Potter's best friends and, like Harry, they thought Dumbledore was a great wizard. Dumbledore liked them too, despite that he wasn't as close to them as he was to Harry.   After his death, he left Ron his Deluminator (a unique artefact created by Dumbledore himself) and Hermione his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard. These gifts were proven very useful, as Ron abandoned Harry and Hermione formerly to find his family, and, when he wanted to come back to Harry and Hermione, the Deluminator showed him the way. The trio also read the Tales of Beedle the Bard and learned about the Deathly Hallows. Harry, Ron and Hermione also visited Dumbledore's portrait, after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Ron also witnessed Voldemort's final duel with Harry.  Dumbledore's Army, his friends and allies Dumbledore's Army was an organisation led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge, and as a supplementary means of practising defensive magic. In 1995, Ron and Hermione convinced Harry to teach anyone who was interested about protective spells and counter-jinxes that had helped him survive his many encounters with Voldemort, as the purely theoretical instruction they were receiving from Umbridge was wholly inadequate. Six members of the D.A. fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In addition to Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Fred and George, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Lavender Brown, Seamus Finnigan, and Dean Thomas, there were eighteen other known members.  The Gryffindor students who were members of the DA included Colin and Dennis Creevey,\nParvati Patil, Lee Jordan (Fred and George Weasley's best friend) Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell (members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team) and Angelina Johnson (captain of the Team, and Ron's future sister-in-law, after marrying George). Fred and Colin Creevey were both murdered by Death Eaters in during the Battle.  The Hufflepuff students were Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Zacharias Smith. Ron was friendly with all of them, except Zacharias, the only one who didn't fight in the Battle of Hogwarts.  The Ravenclaw students were Padma Patil (Parvati's twin sister), Cho Chang, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Marietta Edgecombe. Ron attended the Yule Ball with Padma, who wasn't pleased with Ron's appearance in his tattered dress robes, and Ron wasn't particularly fond of Michael Corner, who was Ginny's ex-boyfriend. They all fought together during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, with the exception of Marietta, who did not return to Hogwarts at any point.  The original Order of the Phoenix The Order of the Phoenix was an organisation founded and led by Albus Dumbledore. The Order included Ron's family, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Rubeus Hagrid, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, Fleur Delacour, Minerva McGonagall, Nymphadora Tonks, and Severus Snape as well as several other notable members of the wizarding community.  In 1994, for Ron's fourth year at Hogwarts, Alastor \"Mad Eye\" Moody, an Auror famous for his great skill, vast experience, and growing paranoia, was appointed professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Prior to the start of the school year, on Lord Voldemort's orders, Moody was attacked and imprisoned in his own magical trunk by Barty Crouch Jnr, who impersonated Moody and took his place at Hogwarts by using Polyjuice Potion until 24 June, 1995. Ron clearly held Moody in high regard, as he looked forward to his classes and persistently hoped that Moody would tell him he would make a good Auror, as he had Harry and Hermione (albeit, it was actually Barty Crouch Jnr who suggested Harry and Hermione consider becoming Aurors). Ron met the real Mad-Eye later in 1995, at 12 Grimmauld Place, the headquarters of the Order. Ron and Moody fought alongside one another in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and in the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Mad-Eye was killed. Ron, like the other members of the Order, was shocked and devastated by the death of someone as tough and skilled as Moody.  Ron was also familiar with the \"useless git\" Mundungus Fletcher, an almost grudging member of the Order. Though Ron was initially amused by Mundungus, he quickly grew disgusted with Mundungus's continued general disregard for other people, or their property and safety, particularly when he abandoned Alastor Moody in the midst of the Battle of the Seven Potters. Ron met Mundungus again when he, Harry and Hermione wanted information regarding the whereabouts of Salazar Slytherin's Locket and appeared amused by Kreacher's repeated abuse of Fletcher.  When Ron, Harry and Hermione apparated into Hogsmeade, intent on sneaking into Hogwarts to find an\nobject that had once belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw, they found themselves in a trap set by Death Eaters. They were saved by Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's younger brother, and owner of the Hog's Head. They discovered that they had been saved by him once before; it was Aberforth who had sent Dobby to rescue them from the Malfoy Manor after Harry saw his eye in the remaining shard of Sirius's two-way mirror. They were later also informed by Neville that Aberforth had been supporting Neville and the other DA members remaining at Hogwarts by feeding them, passing messages using enchanted coins, and generally backing them in their resistance against Severus Snape and the Carrows.  Other Order members Ron encountered were Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror who would later go on to become Minister for Magic and who was greatly admired by Ron, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys; Elphias Doge, Albus Dumbledore's friend; as well as Dedalus Diggle, Hestia Jones, Sturgis Podmore, and Emmeline Vance. Emmeline Vance was killed by Death Eaters in 1996, and Podmore was imprisoned because he attempted to get into the Department of Mysteries, under the Imperius Curse, the news of which shocked and horrified Ron.  It is likely that every surviving member of the Order (except Arabella Figg, who was a Squib and unable to fight, but might have helped in another way) fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside Ron, Harry, and Hermione.  Ronald is the Scottish form of the Scandinavian name Ragnvald, which was derived from the Old Norse Ragnvaldr, composed of the elements ragn, \"advice\", and valdr, \"ruler\".[65] It is a cognate of the name Reginald, which is derived from the Germanic form of the name, Raginwald, meaning \"the prince's counsellor\". All these names carry the meaning of a person who acts as a trusted advisor to a person in power, much as Ron acted as a friend and confidant to Harry Potter.  In keeping with the pattern of Weasley family members taking names from Arthurian legend, \"Ron\" is the name of Arthur's lance in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain. Ron is short for Rhongomyniad, which means \"striker spear\" in Welsh.  Bilius comes from the word \"bile\", as one of the four humours discussed by Ancient Greek philosophers. Yellow bile was connected to the element of fire, which is the element of Gryffindor house, and someone with an excess of it was believed to be bad-tempered, as Ron is. The English adjective \"bilious\" also applies to those who have an irritable temper.[66]  Ron as he appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition, illustrated by Jim Kay Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley Ron Weasley in 1998 Ron on Pottermore Quidditch Keeper Ron Weasley as he appears in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite Ron Weasley as he appears in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite Ron Weasley in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 Ron Weasley in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 In an interview with J.

During her childhood, she became resentful of her sister for being a witch, broke off contact with her sister, and refused to have any contact with the wizarding world.  She married a Muggle, Vernon Dursley and they had a son, Dudley. However, when Lily and her husband were murdered by Lord Voldemort, Petunia became the legal guardian of her nephew, Harry Potter, who was only an infant then. She neglected and treated him cruelly for the most part (mainly due to her aversion to the Potters being wizards), and confined him to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs (although she allowed him a room of his own after receiving his acceptance letters to Hogwarts in order to attempt to trick Hogwarts into not sending letters).  In 1991, when Rubeus Hagrid came and said that Harry would go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she became very angry at the fact her nephew had discovered his true magical heritage. She and her family left their home in 1997 in order to be protected from Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.  After the Second Wizarding War, her son married and she had two grandchildren. Through her nephew's marriage to Ginny Weasley, she had two great-nephews, James Sirius and Albus Severus Potter, the former named after her late brother-in-law, and a great-niece, Lily Luna Potter, named after her late sister.  She died sometime before 2020, although the cause of death and when exactly she died was unknown.  Petunia was the first child of Muggles Mr and Mrs Evans and eventually gained a younger sister, Lily. However, Lily had many unusual abilities, such as making a flower's petals move without touching them, which her sister viewed with a mixture of envy and disapproval -- these emotions were heightened when her parents praised Lily for her magical abilities more and more,\nand Petunia got more jealous.[4]  Petunia and Lily as children Severus Snape, a boy who also lived in the town of Cokeworth,[6] possessed similar abilities, and the two (Petunia and Snape) treated each other disdainfully. Lily, however, was intrigued by Snape and soon became good friends with him.[4] Snape, later on, also developed a crush on Lily,[4] which Petunia may have known about or not. If she did, it was likely she was scornful of it.  When Lily received a letter from Hogwarts confirming that she was a witch, Petunia wrote to Albus Dumbledore asking if she could also study there too. Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia could not study at Hogwarts due to her being a Muggle and even though he responded kindly, Petunia felt hurt and left out. From that point on, Petunia wanted nothing to do with magic or the wizarding world and frequently called Lily a \"freak\". [4]  At some point in the early 1970s, Petunia left her home in Cokeworth to pursue a typing course in London. This led to her getting a clerical job, where she met Vernon Dursley, a junior executive whose complete ordinariness she found appealing. Vernon also took a fancy to Petunia and the two went on a number of dates, which mainly involved Vernon discussing himself and his narrow views of the world.[6]  Vernon proposed to Petunia in his mother's sitting room[6] in late 1977.[7] Petunia gladly accepted, but secretly worried what Vernon would think when he met Lily, who was then in her seventh year at Hogwarts. She eventually told Vernon about Lily being a witch on a date in his car that was parked overlooking a chip shop from which they had purchased battered sausage and while he was shocked, he assured her he would not hold it against her, much to Petunia's relief.[6]  The couple's first meeting with Lily and her boyfriend, James Potter, went very poorly. Vernon tried to impress James with the car he drove and when James responded by describing his racing broom, Vernon assumed he must be living on unemployment benefits. James told Vernon about his parents' fortune in Galleons, but since Vernon could not tell whether he was being had on or not, he became angry. The evening ended with Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears.[6]  Petunia's and Vernon's wedding portrait Petunia and Vernon were married and settled at 4 Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey by the end of 1977.[7] Fearing that she would be overshadowed, Petunia refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, which upset Lily.[6] At the reception, Vernon would not talk to James, but insultingly described him as \"some magician\" within his earshot.[6]  Petunia had little contact with her sister thereafter. She and Vernon chose not to attend James and Lily's wedding and the last piece of mail Lily sent her was an announcement of her son Harry's birth on 31 July, 1980, which she took one look at and promptly threw away.[6] However, Lily mentioned\nhaving been sent a vase for Christmas by Petunia in a letter to Sirius Black dated around 31 July, 1981.[8]  Petunia and Vernon's only child, a son named Dudley, was born on 23 June, 1980. The couple took pride in being a \"normal\" family who had birthed a normal son, unlike Lily and her family.[3]  Harry Potter is left on the Dursleys' doorstep Everything changed on the morning of 2 November, 1981, when Petunia opened her door to find a baby on her doorstep. The child turned out to be her nephew, Harry Potter. A letter had been left by Albus Dumbledore, explaining the circumstances of Harry's arrival, including the death of both her sister Lily and her brother-in-law James.[3] As she was the only member of the family that had her sister's blood running through her, this ensured the protection of Harry and his family from Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. She reluctantly agreed to take her orphaned nephew into her home and family, taking the responsibility to not tell Harry or anyone else about the fact that Harry was a wizard.[9]  Petunia and her husband in their bedroom at Privet Drive Petunia, despite taking him in, did not treat him very well at all. The boy's mere existence gave Petunia a constant reminder of her sister and the world she herself had been excluded from. She kept Harry in the Cupboard Under the Stairs as a bedroom for much of his childhood. She made a point of showering Dudley with gifts while completely ignoring Harry as a reference to how she feels she was treated as a child, but this time with a Muggle being superior.   She also forced Harry to do", "PPL": 0.05965549871325493, "PPL/lower": 0.21982745461220515, "PPL/zlib": 1.8044615460754665e-05, "Min-5%": 1.1815800465935586, "Min-10%": 0.5946781508072152, "Min-20%": 0.2978324171854183, "Min-30%": 0.19868036922096224, "Min-40%": 0.14922239810132568, "Min-50%": 0.11935002894246839, "Min-60%": 0.0994363863003615}, {"text": ", and did not punish Draco when the boy refused to answer his summons to the office, something other students would not get off with so easily and which Draco took advantage of. Snape continued to protect Draco even after they fled from the Battle of the Astronomy Tower together; when questioned by Voldemort about Draco's actions during his attempted murder of Dumbledore, Snape lied and told the Dark Lord that Malfoy hadn't lowered his wand and emphasised the young student's ability to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts as well as cornering Dumbledore, which allowed Snape to kill him. Snape's defence of Malfoy saved the boy's life and convinced Voldemort to free Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, for which Draco reconciled with Snape.  It\nis unknown how Draco reacted when he learned about Snape's death by Lord Voldemort in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, or of his true loyalty to the Order of the Phoenix due to his love for the Muggle-born mother of Harry Potter, Lily Evans. However, given Draco's own disillusionment with the Death Eater cause and subsequent rapprochement with Harry, it is likely that Draco came to sympathise with his late teacher. In addition, it is possible that Draco's aforementioned detente with Harry as adults might have been motivated, at least in part, to avoid having a similar relationship that Snape had with Harry's father and his friends after their own Hogwarts years.  Harry Potter, his school rival and enemy turned ally and later friend Draco became Harry Potter's arch-rival almost immediately after they met, just before their first year at Hogwarts. Draco was at first interested in Harry because he was so famous, but Harry was unimpressed by his arrogant manner. For the rest of their time at school, Harry and Draco loathed each other and tried to one up each other whenever possible, although Harry compared to Ron was less prone to incorporating violence on Draco. This reached its pinnacle after Lucius Malfoy was sent to Azkaban following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.  After finding out what Draco had gone through during their sixth year, Harry began to feel somewhat sorry for him, a feeling intensified by witnessing the use to which Lord Voldemort was putting him. During that year, Harry nearly killed Draco with the Half-Blood Prince's curse Sectumsempra (which he used by accident, unaware of what the effects of the curse were). Harry himself felt utterly horrified and guilty at what he did.[19] However, despite their enmity towards each other, Draco showed great reluctance in identifying Harry and his friends when they were imprisoned in his home. In turn, Harry saved his life twice during the Battle of Hogwarts.[21] The main reason behind Draco's enmity towards Harry was Draco's jealousy of Harry.[32]  Over the years, Draco and Harry made their peace as adults, but still were not friends by the time Scorpius and Albus started school. This later developed into a more cordial relationship due to Scorpius and Albus being best friends. Draco would grow to trust Harry's luck and instincts over the years, and knew that Harry was always in the thick of the action when it was necessary. Draco would grow to have a deep respect and friendly relationship with Albus Potter and trusted him with helping Scorpius heal from the grief of losing his mother. During the Delphini crisis, Draco would come to confess much to Harry, discussing at first in a rather distant manner, but upon revealing key details about his wife prior to and after her death as well as his family's hidden Time Turner, Draco and Harry finally came to a mutual respect for one another, and saw each other as friends for the first time, though it still did not heal everything in spite of many\nconfessions. Draco even admitted that he had always envied Harry, Ron, and Hermione's friendship.  Draco was first cousins, twice removed, with at least one member of the Potter family, through the Black family. It is almost certain that the said Potter was related to Harry, but it is unknown whether Harry and Draco were aware of it.  The Weasley family (excluding Bill and Charlie) The Malfoy family generally looked down upon the Weasley family for their lack of wealth and 'blood traitor' status, a sentiment Draco made clear immediately upon meeting Ron Weasley on the train to Hogwarts for their first year.[16] He and Ron had a hostility that mirrored that of their fathers, often insulting one another and prone even to physical fights at times. Draco also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song Weasley is Our King, which was meant to undermine Ron's abilities as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[18]  When Crabbe set the Room of Requirement on fire, Ron assisted Harry and Hermione in pulling Draco and Goyle away, but with some reluctance. When he and his friends saved Draco again later that night from a Death Eater Draco was pleading with, Ron punched him in the face and called him a 'two-faced bastard'. Although this enmity seems to have faded with age, Ron discouraged his daughter Rose from becoming friends with Draco's son, Scorpius.[21]  Draco had less interaction with other members of the Weasley family. Fred and George Weasley attempted twice to physically assault Draco; The first time was when he called Hermione Granger a 'filthy little Mudblood'[13] and the second time after Draco insulted their mother and father, as well as Harry Potter's mother, Lily Evans (earning both twins, as well as Harry, a 'lifetime Quidditch ban' from Dolores Umbridge) and made sure to hex Draco, along with other members of the Inquisitorial Squad, when they left Hogwarts. Ginny also had a few hostile encounters with Draco, most notably hitting him with a Bat-Bogey Hex when the Inquisitorial Squad tried to hold her, Ron, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood in 1996.[18] Draco also appeared to dislike Percy and showed no respect towards him despite the latter being a prefect.  Hermione Granger, his former enemy and whom he used to bully Draco's relationship with Hermione Granger was coloured before the two even met, although they never actually interacted until their second year. Draco was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and by his second year, his father had told him he should be ashamed that Hermione beat him in all of his school marks. Thus, Draco often taunted Hermione, calling her the derogatory epithet 'Mudblood', but she refused to ever be bullied. During the period when Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets was attacking Muggle-born students, Malfoy told his friends Crabbe and Goyle (really Harry and Ron using Polyjuice Potion) in the Slytherin common room that he hoped Granger would be the next victim.[13]  Although Hermione generally ignored Draco's taunts rather than getting into fights with\nhim like Harry and Ron, occasionally the two would exchange sharp words and, in their third year, Hermione even slapped him for insulting Hagrid.[17] When he encountered the trio in Madam Malkin's before the start of their sixth year, he asked who had given Hermione a black eye (the result of a boxing telescope) so that he could 'send them flowers'.[19] Despite his dislike for and prejudice towards Hermione, Draco still advised Ron and Harry to get her to safety during the Death Eater riot at the Quidditch World Cup (albeit in a taunting manner)[3] and demonstrated reluctance to identify her to his aunt Bellatrix, avoiding even looking at her.[21]  In 2017, when Ron encouraged their daughter not to associate with Draco's son, Hermione expressed a more conciliatory attitude.[21] Draco and Hermione became third cousins, once removed in law when Hermione married Ron Weasley. Draco's son Scorpius would eventually develop a deep crush and even fall in love with Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley.

Unlike Bellatrix, who did not hold love for her husband, Narcissa truly loved Lucius.[4]  Narcissa was very upset when he was briefly imprisoned in Azkaban and became defensive when others mentioned his failures.[4] In 1997, when Lord Voldemort took over their home and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, Lucius looked to his wife in disapproval, and only when she touched his wrist did he turn it over.[15]  Draco Malfoy, her son Narcissa adored her only child, Draco, and was very protective of him.[4][30][35] She insisted he not attend the Durmstrang Institute because it was so far from home,[23] and frequently sent him sweet and cake packages while during his first year at Hogwarts.[24][25]  Narcissa was terrified to the point of hysteria when Draco was ordered by Lord Voldemort to kill Albus Dumbledore. Narcissa suspected that Voldemort meant him to fail as punishment for her husband's failure in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. To help him, Narcissa went to Severus Snape and begged for his assistance, whereupon she asked of him to make the Unbreakable Vow in which he promised to take over Draco's task if he failed.[4] Later on in the war, she tried to shelter Draco as much as possible. During the\nBattle of Hogwarts, Narcissa lied to the Dark Lord about Harry Potter's death so she and Lucius would be able to search for Draco in the castle.[35] Draco, in turn, held his mother in great esteem, and became extremely angry if anyone insulted her.[25][30]  Narcissa and her husband Lucius did not think highly of her, as she raised their grandson Scorpius to have a more tolerant view on Muggles (and likely Muggle-borns, half-bloods, Squibs or even non-human magical creatures).  Because of this, family gatherings were often fraught with tension. It is likely they see Astoria as a blood traitor because of this. Her relationship with Scorpius is unknown.  Bellatrix Lestrange, her elder sister Narcissa appeared to have a fairly affectionate and close relationship with her older sister Bellatrix. The two fondly called each other by their nicknames of \"Cissy\" and \"Bella\". Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to see Snape at Spinner's End, in spite of her distrust for Severus Snape and belief that they should not discuss the task Voldemort assigned in secret.[4]  Narcissa was also one of the only people who was able to question Bellatrix's authority without unleashing Bellatrix's anger.[4][10] The two sometimes clashed over Draco, as Narcissa was concerned about his welfare, while Bellatrix coldly stated her belief that he was doing his duty by serving Voldemort and that Narcissa should be proud.[4]  It is not known whether Narcissa knew about Bellatrix's daughter from Voldemort, but Delphini was born at the Malfoy Manor. If Narcissa did know, then it is possible that she continued to keep this a secret for many years to come to protect not only her niece but also her own family from any public reaction to the idea that the Dark Lord had a child and this child was born at the Malfoys' home.  Narcissa's relationship with her other late cousin, Regulus Black, Sirius's younger brother, is unknown, though judging by Regulus's inclination towards the pure-blood supremacist ideals of the Blacks, which led him to follow Lord Voldemort and become one of his Death Eaters, the same circle to which her husband belonged, it is likely that she and he had a good relationship and maintained contact, or at least held him in higher esteem than Sirius, who earned his family's repudiation for his rejection of their ideals. It is unknown whether she knew of her cousin's betrayal to the Dark Lord in an attempt to keep the life of his house elf, Kreacher, safe, but if so, it is likely that she regretted the event, rather than being outraged at the lack of loyalty to Voldemort that Regulus may have expressed to him at the end. The confidences between Kreacher, Regulus' house elf, with her and Bellatrix, could also be an indicator of the good relationship she may have had with his late master, beyond a simple response to the good treatment he may have received from the two of them, which led him to betray Sirius, in revenge for the mistreatment he had dealt with on his part, and\nwas instrumental in his death.  Narcissa did not hold her late cousin Sirius Black or her older sister, Andromeda Tonks, in high regard, presumably because they were both \"blood traitors\" who were disowned by the Black family. Bellatrix claimed that she and Narcissa had not seen Andromeda since she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, which would have occurred in the early 1970s.[15] Narcissa also mercilessly threw Sirius's death in Harry Potter's face when he taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment in 1996.[30] For his part, Sirius held his cousin in contempt for her prejudiced beliefs.[13] Since Narcissa broke all ties with her sister Andromeda, she most likely didn't care either for her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, and didn't consider her to be a part of the family.  Harry Potter, whom she saved from Lord Voldemort Harry held Narcissa in contempt due to his rivalry with her son and hatred of her husband.[25][30] In the same respect, Narcissa held Harry and his friends in disdain and contempt: especially Hermione Granger, as she was Muggle-born, and Ron Weasley, as he was a blood traitor. Narcissa also held Harry in contempt for being Dumbledore's favourite student and associating with those whom she considered to be inferior.[30] It is also possible that her dislike of Harry was motivated in part by her likely image of Harry's late father, James Potter, who was a known abuser during his time at Hogwarts, directing much of his abuse towards Severus Snape, a long-time friend of the Malfoy family.  When Voldemort \"killed\" Harry in the Forbidden Forest, she asked him whether Draco was still alive, as she knew that the only way she and Lucius could search for Draco inside Hogwarts would be as part of Voldemort's victorious army. Though she disliked Harry, she placed her family's welfare over Voldemort's goals. On confirming Draco's very much alive status, she plainly lied that Harry Potter was \"dead\". This action of hers was both very crucial and important, not only for Harry's survival but for Voldemort's final defeat as well, thus ensuring Harry was again protected by a mother's love, although indirectly.[35] Since Draco had made peace with Harry after this, Narcissa probably just chose to leave Harry in peace.  Severus Snape Like Draco, Narcissa held Severus Snape in high esteem and trusted him due to him being an old friend of Lucius's since time at Hogwarts. Unlike her son, she continued to invest her faith in him despite Lucius's imprisonment and Bellatrix Lestrange, her older sister, voicing doubts about him. When Draco was made a Death Eater and ordered to kill Albus Dumbledore as his first mission by Voldemort, Narcissa saw this suicide mission for what it was and went to Snape, who also knew Draco was being set up to fail, for help and got him to make an Unbreakable Vow to watch over Draco and take over if it seemed he would fail.[4]  How she reacted to Snape being a double agent is unknown but it can be assumed she was sympathetic since she and Lucius\nhad ceased to be loyal to Voldemort for similar reasons and the fact that he was the one who convinced Voldemort to free her husband from Azkaban and was the only Death Eater who continued to treat Lucius with respect after his loss of favour, something even her older sister didn't do.  Kreacher Like most of the Blacks except Sirius, Narcissa was held in high esteem by Kreacher the House Elf.

The six D.A. members battling Death Eaters for possession of the prophecy Hermione's fear turned out to be justified, as Harry's vision was a ruse planted in his brain by Voldemort designed to lure him to the Ministry to obtain a prophecy Voldemort sought. As soon as Harry did this, the six D.A. members were surrounded by Death Eaters, and a battle ensued. Hermione stunned Nott when he grabbed Harry, thus freeing him and causing Nott to be injured by the collapsing shelves of prophecies. She later stunned another Death Eater and Silenced Antonin Dolohov before\nhe could alert the other Death Eaters to the group's location. She was critically injured by the curse Dolohov subsequently struck her with, but made a full recovery.[31]  Hermione visiting Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes for the first time Hermione achieved high academic prestige when she obtained ten O.W.L.s, in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Care of Magical Creatures, Arithmancy, History of Magic, Herbology, Astronomy, Potions, and Ancient Runes. She received 'Outstanding' marks on each of them, except Defence Against the Dark Arts in which she received an 'Exceeds Expectations'. In total she achieved 10 O.W.L.s. Ron found it amusing that she actually seemed disappointed by this.[35]  Hermione brewing a Draught of Living Death in a N.E.W.T.-level Potions lesson By the time they arrived in Hogwarts, Hermione's romantic feelings for Ron had become obvious. According to Harry the two seemed on their way to a romantic relationship. Hermione and Ron's relationship suffered greatly in their sixth year, when Ron became envious of both Hermione and Harry, who were invited to be members of the Slug Club, a group of students favoured by Potions professor Horace Slughorn, while he was ignored. Hermione strongly disapproved of Harry using the textbook of the \"Half-Blood Prince\" to get ahead in Potions unfairly, though she did not turn him in and indirectly found a clue about the book owner. She was particularly alarmed by the increasingly Dark nature of the magic in the book, such as the spell Sectumsempra.  Harry comforting an upset Hermione after she witnessed Ron snogging Lavender However, during an argument with his sister, Ginny mocked Ron about his inexperience with the opposite gender and told him that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum during their earlier romance. Ron subsequently began treating Hermione coldly, much to her bewilderment. She was upset when he and Lavender started flirting. When she found out about Ron's relationship with Lavender, she conjured a flock of wild birds to attack Ron for his insensitivity regarding her feelings. He became even angrier with her when she believed that Harry slipped Ron Felix Felicis to assist in his Quidditch-playing abilities; despite having believed it initially himself, he accused her of having no faith in him when it was discovered that he had not been slipped the potion at all.   After this, Hermione attended Slughorn's Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen to get back at Ron, but it did not go well due to the former's impoliteness. Afterwards, Ron (who was relieved that Hermione and McLaggen's date did not go well) attempted to speak to Hermione, but she ignored him, still upset and angry over his previous treatment of her.[35] This behaviour presisted for quite sometime.  Madam Pomfrey checking on a poisoned Ron, while Hermione, Harry, and Ginny are sitting by his bedside The two reconciled after Ron was hospitalised due to consuming poisoned mead, an event that left Hermione shaken and frightened. After the incident she remained unusually quiet and subdued. Whilst sitting at Ron's bedside, Ron subconsciously muttered Hermione's name. By this time, Ron was visibly\ndisillusioned with his relationship with Lavender, who had become possessive of him and called him by the annoying nickname \"Won-Won\". He was also pleased whenever Hermione visited him in the hospital wing.   He began avoiding Lavender, who soon became suspicious of his relationship with Hermione, ultimately leading to an argument about her. After Lavender saw Ron and Hermione come down alone from the boys' dormitories (Harry was present also, but under the invisibility cloak), she had a fight with Ron and broke up with him. When Ron told Harry and Hermione about breaking up with Lavender, Harry could have sworn he saw Hermione smirk.  Hermione and Ron discussing the Half-Blood Prince Afterwards, Hermione and Ron were more comfortable together, and their relationship improved considerably, although a romantic relationship remained out of their reach. Hermione comforted Ron after he failed his Apparition test because he Splinched half an eyebrow, while he teased her about the instructor's praise for her flawless performance. That year, Hermione also quickly mastered nonverbal magic, the first in her class to do so.   Throughout the year, Hermione and Ron were both sceptical of Harry's theory that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark and was up to something. Moreover, she was confident that Malfoy couldn't have brought any Dark objects into Hogwarts without alerting Filch. These claims were heard by Draco himself, who used these details and Hermione's previous plan of communication to accomplish his own.  A tearful Hermione standing at the base of the Astronomy Tower after Dumbledore's death Near the end of the school year, Harry's suspicions would be proven right. Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school by means of a pair of vanishing cabinets. One cabinet resided in Borgin and Burkes and the other in the Room of Hidden Things (as it had been presumed broken, but Malfoy managed to fix it). This infiltration of Death Eaters resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Hermione fought in the battle and remained unscathed thanks to some Felix Felicis.[35] This was a gift from Harry, who had won it in a Potions competition and had a preconceived notion of what was going to happen. He told Hermione, Ron, and Ginny to drink it beforehand in case his worries proved true.  The funeral of Albus Dumbledore Throughout the school year, Hermione and Ron had been informed of the content of Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore. Through these lessons Harry, and in turn Hermione and Ron, learned about the existence of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, who had been killed by Snape in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Hermione was comforted by Ron and cried on his shoulder. Afterwards, Harry told them about his desire to drop out of Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes, which were the key to defeating Lord Voldemort. Despite his protests, Hermione and Ron promised to forgo their seventh year of school in order to assist Harry. Before leaving the school, Hermione was able to Summon books about Horcruxes so as\nto learn how to destroy the items. She found them in Dumbledore's office, where the late headmaster had kept them after the subject had been banned at Hogwarts.  Hermione modifying her parents' memories Hermione began planning for her journey with Harry and Ron immediately. Concerned for the safety of her family, she altered her parents' memories to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in Australia, no longer aware of their original identities, the existence of their daughter, or anything she had told them about Harry. She also withdrew all of her savings at her building society account, in event of a need for Muggle money.[10].   The seven Potters and their protectors right before the sky battle Hermione then joined the Order of the Phoenix in the operation to remove Harry from 4 Privet Drive before his 17th birthday, taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the \"seven Potters\". Hermione flew on a Thestral with Kingsley Shacklebolt. The two fought off at least five Death Eaters, possibly killing one, injuring two, and were pursued by Lord Voldemort himself at one point. In time, they arrived safely at the Burrow, where Hermione was immensely relieved to see Harry alive and ran to him and hugged him tight, but she was greatly worried when", "PPL": 0.12267511337995529, "PPL/lower": 0.16779906989857116, "PPL/zlib": 3.343557192149231e-05, "Min-5%": 2.363760235847211, "Min-10%": 1.2191585874933677, "Min-20%": 0.6122831315186995, "Min-30%": 0.4085570411473749, "Min-40%": 0.306867510419052, "Min-50%": 0.24543721208606112, "Min-60%": 0.20448337378054912}, {"text": "time afterwards. It is unknown how Ron reacted to Lavender's death in the Battle of Hogwarts. It can assumed that he was saddened by it, as they were once friends.  Viktor Krum, his rival Ron was a huge fan of Viktor Krum, as he was the Seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, enthusiastic to the point of purchasing a miniature Krum figurine at the Quidditch World Cup and bringing it with him to school. However, his feelings changed markedly when Krum began seeing Hermione Granger and the two attended the Yule Ball together in 1994. Despite his jealousy, Ron asked Krum for his autograph following the end of the Triwizard Tournament, much to Krum's surprise and Hermione's amusement. During Ron's sixth year, he discovered that Hermione had \"snogged\" Krum in the course of their brief romance, which caused Ron's jealousy of Krum to resurge. He expressed these feelings in 1997, at Bill and Fleur's wedding, when Krum's appearance as a guest inspired Ron to whisk Hermione away to dance.  Pigwidgeon became Ron's owl in 1994. He was given to Ron by Sirius Black, as Sirius felt partially responsible for the loss of Ron's pet rat, who turned out to be the Animagus and Death Eater, Peter Pettigrew, in disguise. Initially, Ron loved him, and enjoyed having an owl of his own, but Pig, as Ron preferred to call him, turned out to be very tiny and hyperactive, and became mainly annoying to Ron (as Errol and Hermes, according to Ron) and had to be kept away from them. It can be assumed that deep down Ron still loved Pigwidgeon considering that before he found out the truth about Peter Pettigrew he still loved \"Scabbers\" despite complaining about his uselessness nonstop.[6]  Crookshanks Crookshanks was Hermione Granger's large, bandy-legged, ginger-coloured, half-Kneazle cat. Ron strongly disliked him at first, largely due to his antagonistic behaviour towards Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In 1993, Scabbers, who was actually the Animagus, Peter Pettigrew, faked his own death for the second time after Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. Ron initially believed Scabbers had been eaten by Crookshanks, and he nearly ended his friendship with Hermione.[6]  When Ron discovered the truth about Scabbers, and found that Crookshanks had been helping Sirius all along, he seemed to appreciate Crookshanks as a good judge of character,\nand even half-jokingly asked the cat if Pigwidgeon was really an owl.[6] When Crookshanks meowed happily, Ron actually seemed relieved. It is unknown if Ron ever saw Crookshanks after the Battle of Hogwarts, since he had been left at The Burrow during Bill and Fleur's wedding.  Cormac McLaggen, his rival In 1996, Ron's competition for the Keeper position on the Gryffindor Quidditch team was Cormac McLaggen, a Gryffindor a year above him. Before the try-outs, Hermione overheard McLaggen insulting Ron and Ginny, and placed a Confundus Charm on him that made him miss his last save. Ron thus beat him, though McLaggen claimed that this was due to favouritism. Ron greatly disliked him, which prompted Hermione to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with him to retaliate against Ron for his romance with Lavender Brown. Ron disliked McLaggen even more, and was happy when his date with Hermione did not go well, and when McLaggen did not perform well as replacement keeper while Ron was in the Hospital Wing.[10]  Dolores Umbridge, his former DADA professor and enemy In 1995, Dolores Umbridge, a Ministry employee, was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. She was a sadistic, very unpleasant woman who derived great satisfaction from torturing students as punishment (most notably, forcing Harry Potter to carve the words \"I must not tell lies\" into the back of his own hand, using a Blood Quill). Ron, like most of the students and faculty at Hogwarts, greatly disliked her intrusive, hypocritical and often outright insulting ways, in return Umbridge disliked Ron, as he was a main offender of the rules and loyal to Harry and a member of Dumbledore's Army. She had an obsession with pure-blood status and both hated and feared people she called half-breeds, like centaurs and half-giants. She also hated Muggle-borns, and probably half-bloods, despite being half-blood herself. In the end of the year, she was attacked by a group of centaurs and eventually brought to the Hospital Wing by Albus Dumbledore. Though she attempted to abscond, Peeves the Poltergeist discovered her sneaking away, and led the students in driving her out Hogwarts.  Ron met again Umbridge in 1997, when he was disguised as Reg Cattermole, a Ministry official, and while Umbridge was in charge of trying Muggle-borns before they were sent to Azkaban. Harry stunned Umbridge during the interrogation of Mary Cattermole, when Umbridge attempted to flaunt Salazar Slytherin's Locket as proof of her relation to the Selwyn family. After Hermione retrieved the locket and replaced it with a decoy using the Geminio curse, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded to help the Muggle-borns awaiting trial escape from the Ministry. After the Second Wizarding War, Umbridge herself was imprisoned in Azkaban for life.  Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington Ron's lack of sensitivity causes him to be unpopular with the Hogwarts ghosts, namely Nearly Headless Nick and Moaning Myrtle. Ron first met Nearly Headless Nick in 1991 during his first welcoming feast. He knew Nick because he heard Fred and George talking about him. Nick requested that Ron should address him as\n\"Sir Nicholas\" instead of Nearly Headless Nick. During later feasts, Ron would annoy Nick by reminding him he was dead and how much he enjoyed food.  Ron met Moaning Myrtle in 1992, during the re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets. Myrtle was upset since Ginny had unknowingly thrown a diary at her. Ron pointed out that it couldn't hurt Myrtle since she was a ghost, and the book would go through her. Myrtle swooped down on Ron with rage and sarcastically commented that everyone should throw books at her and make a game out of it.  Lord Voldemort, a hated enemy As Ron was raised within the wizarding world, he had grown up fearing the name of Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time. He was afraid to say the name or even to hear it, and protested when Harry refused to refer to Voldemort as \"You-Know-Who\" or \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\". Ron helped Harry protect the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort at the end of their first year, when he won a game of Wizard's chess by sacrificing himself. Ron also helped Harry get into the Chamber of Secrets and save Ron's younger sister.  Ron's fear of saying Voldemort's name ended up being justified and delaying the capture of Harry, Hermione and himself, as he managed to convince Harry and Hermione to refer to Voldemort as \"You-Know-Who\" around the same time saying the name was made Taboo. In 1998, Ron used Godric Gryffindor's sword to destroy Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. The locket tortured Ron, as a \"Riddle-Harry\" and a \"Riddle-Hermione\" appeared, eventually kissing, telling Ron that he was useless, that no woman would choose him over Harry, that his own mother will choose Harry as a son instead of him, and that she wanted a girl when she had him. Ron showed the strength of his personality in by overcoming his insecurities and stabbing the locket with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, destroying the Horcrux.  During the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron was present when Voldemort told the crowd that Harry had been killed while trying to save himself.

When James started at Hogwarts, he met and became best friends with three fellow Gryffindor students: Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. He also met Severus Snape, a Slytherin student with whom he became bitter rivals. During his seventh year, James was appointed Head Boy and began dating Lily Evans.   After graduating from Hogwarts, he married Lily and together they had a son, Harry James Potter, of whom he made Sirius Black the godfather. James, Lily, and their friends all fought in the First Wizarding War as members of the Order of the Phoenix; he and his wife defied Lord Voldemort three times. However, James and Lily were forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Voldemort and their infant son. James and Lily were ultimately betrayed to Voldemort by one of their close friends (Peter Pettigrew).    As a result of this, James was tragically murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en in 1981. He and his wife died while trying to protect infant Harry.   James briefly appeared again in May 1998 through the Resurrection Stone. He appeared through it along with\nLily (his wife), Sirius Black and Remus Lupin (his friends). After the Second Wizarding War, James posthumously had three grandchildren through his son: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna Potter, the first of whom was named after his grandfather and his father's godfather (and friend of the former).  James Potter was born on 27 March 1960 to Fleamont Potter and his wife Euphemia. Fleamont was an accomplished, yet retired cosmetic potioneer and entrepreneur best known for inventing Sleekeazy's Hair Potion in 1926. Both Fleamont and Euphemia were elderly even by wizarding standards.[12]  Having been conceived so late in his parents' lives, he was raised in a doting household with little material limits, and pampered a great deal. Hence, it was no surprise that he grew to be proud, arrogant, and boastful, but deep down still a good person.[18]  James after being Sorted into Gryffindor, sitting next to Lily Evans James started his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1971\u20131972 school year and was sorted into Gryffindor House. While there, he befriended fellow Gryffindors Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, and together they formed a small gang known only to themselves as the Marauders. Though more mischievous than diligent, James proved to be a clever student.   At some point during his education, he became Chaser for his House's Quidditch team, in which he was completely aware of his talent and often boasted to his fellow students. It is possible that he also collected Chocolate Frog Cards, as at an unknown time, the History of Magic teacher, Professor Cuthbert Binns, gave him the Circe card, which later came into the possession of Quirinus Quirrell, who kept it at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Vault 998.[19]  At some time at school, he and Sirius used an illegal hex (perhaps Engorgio Skullus) on Bertram Aubrey which caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown what motivated the duo to hex him, though it rewarded them a double detention.[20]  The Marauders in their Animagus forms As second years, James, Sirius, and Peter figured out that Remus was a werewolf, but rather than abandoning him (James, in particular, insisted this monthly hazard did not mean Remus was truly abnormal), they spent three years learning to become Animagi in order to accompany Remus in his transformations. In his fifth year, James managed to perfect the transformation and become a stag Animagus, which earned him the nickname \"Prongs\". Using their new nicknames, the four friends created the Marauder's Map, which displayed the Hogwarts Castle area and everyone within it \u2014including all staff, ghosts and students \u2014 in their current location at a given time, and thus made sneaking out of the castle and avoiding teachers much easier.[5]  At some time during his school years, James took a photograph of Hogwarts Castle at sunset that he gave to Lupin.[21]  For the vast majority of his time at school, James was somewhat an obnoxious youth with a love of showing off and exceptional\nself-confidence that bordered on arrogance. Severus Snape once said that he was so arrogant that \"criticism simply bounced off him\".[22] This rebellious attitude was notably shaped by the negative qualities he developed, such as the habit of ruffling his already messy hair to make it even untidier to look as though he had just alighted from his broomstick. He also enjoyed hexing Slytherin students, especially Severus Snape, merely for the fact that he could.   James being obnoxious and trying to get Lily Evans's attention James and Snape had a strong rivalry throughout their time at Hogwarts. To Remus and Sirius, the reason this rivalry began was due to Snape's jealousy over James's talent at Quidditch and his popularity, as well as Snape's interest in the Dark Arts, which James despised. However, it was later revealed that James and Sirius had got off on the wrong foot with Snape from the beginning: when they first met Snape during their first year on the Hogwarts Express, they insulted him (setting a solid foundation for rivalry), and their further interactions only served to make their rivalry intense and permanent \u2014 Snape followed the Marauders around, looking for reasons to get them expelled. James, in turn, used the hexes Snape himself had made up against him.[23]  At some point in their school years, Snape grew very interested in where Remus went every month, and saw Madam Pomfrey and Remus going to the Shrieking Shack using a secret passage under the Whomping Willow. Sirius had, as a joke, told him that the trick to getting past the Whomping Willow was to poke the knot at the bottom. Snape followed Sirius's directions, and was nearly at the Shrieking Shack when James pulled him back. At great risk to his own life, James saved Severus from certain death from Remus in werewolf form, but Snape adamantly refused to believe that his old rival would have done him a favour, believing that James had only saved him in order to avoid expulsion, and despised being in his debt.[24][5]  The Marauders bullying Snape in their fifth year James spent much of his academic career chasing after Lily Evans, an attractive Muggle-born fellow Gryffindor from Snape's hometown of Cokeworth who was secretly Snape's best friend and childhood crush since before they both started at Hogwarts. Lily was among those who were not so impressed of James, considering him arrogant and obnoxious.   She once demanded James to quit jinxing Snape for fun. The former and his friends were in the middle of bullying Snape with a spell of Snape's own invention. Lily told him to stop and James responded with, \"I will if you'll go out with me, Evans.\" When James took the jinx off, Snape in his humiliation and anger, called Lily a \"filthy little Mudblood\". James demanded him to apologise, but Lily responded that James was as bad as Snape and she would not date him \"even if it were a choice between him and the Giant Squid\".[16] Snape's friendship with the vivacious and pretty\nLily may have sparked", "PPL": 0.04765382036566734, "PPL/lower": 0.11506717050210259, "PPL/zlib": 1.3697562623071958e-05, "Min-5%": 0.9362867193333074, "Min-10%": 0.4727410771701412, "Min-20%": 0.23745842576072457, "Min-30%": 0.15857809550638527, "Min-40%": 0.11916149971463881, "Min-50%": 0.0953261632525079, "Min-60%": 0.07942776890021191}, {"text": "turn treated the attention starved house elf more kindly than her cousin did.

At least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery & Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells & Harry Potter: Magic Awakened & Hogwarts Legacy. As such, spoilers will be present within the article. Each spell in the list is described in a text block, separated by an empty line. The name of the spell, the type, the spell description and optionally the reference and the etymology are provided in each text block.\n\nSpell name: Aberto\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: Portuguese for 'open'. Compare Spanish 'abierto'.\nDescription: A spell used to open doors; it is probably related to Alohamora.\n\nSpell name: Accio\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: The Latin word accio means \"I call\" or \"I summon\".\nDescription: Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is casted nonverbally). This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it. The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target as long as they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledore's office simply by saying \"Accio Horcrux books!\" while in Gryffindor Tower.\n\nSpell name: Age Line\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Prevents people above or below a certain age from access to a target.\n\nSpell name: Aguamenti\nSpell type: Charm, Conjuration\nEtymology: Possibly a hybrid of Latin words aqua, which means \"water\", and menti, which means \"for the mind\".\nDescription: Produces a clean, drinkable jet of water from the wand tip.\n\nSpell name: Alarte Ascendare\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: Ascendere is a Latin infinitive meaning \"to go up,\"\"to climb,\" \"to embark,\" \"to rise(figuratively);\" this is the origin of the English word \"ascend\".\nDescription: Shoots the target high into the air.\n\nSpell name: Albus Dumbledore's forceful spell\nSpell type: Spell\nDescription: This spell was, supposedly, quite powerful as when it was cast, the opponent was forced to conjure a silver shield to deflect it.\n\nSpell name: Alohomora\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: The incantation is derived from the West African Sidiki dialect used in geomancy; it means \"friendly to thieves\".\nDescription: Unlocks doors and other locked objects. It can also unlock doors that have been sealed with a Locking Spell, although it is possible to bewitch doors to become unaffected by this spell.\n\nSpell name: Amato Animo Animato Animagus\nSpell type: Transfiguration\nEtymology: Amato is a conjugation of the Latin word amo, which means \"I love\" or \"I am obliged to\". Animo and animato are both different conjugations of the Latin word animo, which can mean \"I animate\" or \"I fill with breath or life\". Animagus on the other hand appears to be a portmanteau of animo or \"animal\", and magus, which is Latin for \"wizard\".[citation needed] Overall, the incantation can roughly mean \"My love brings me life, I am obliged to become an animal wizard.\"\nDescription: Spell used as part of the process of becoming an Animagus. The incantation has to be recited at sunrise and sundown, every day before the consumption of the Animagus Potion. The incantation is also recited just prior to the consumption of the potion, which has to take place just after a lightning storm starts. The incantation is recited while placing the wand's tip over one's heart.\n\nSpell name: Anapneo\nSpell type: Healing Spell, Vanishment\nEtymology: From the Greek verb anapneo, meaning \"I breathe in.\"\nDescription: Clears the target's airway if they are choking on something.\n\nSpell name: Anteoculatia\nSpell type: Dark charm\nDescription: Causes the target to grow antlers.\n\nSpell name: Anti-Cheating Spell\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Used to prevent cheating.\n\nSpell name: Anti-Apparition Charm\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Prevents Apparition within range of an area. Often used to keep out unwanted visitors from an area.\n\nSpell name: Anti-Disapparition Jinx\nSpell type: Jinx\nDescription: Prevents Disapparation within an area. It is often used to entrap an enemy in an area.\n\nSpell name: Anti-intruder jinx\nSpell type: Jinx\nDescription: Prevents intrud", "PPL": 0.14090387523174286, "PPL/lower": 0.13043862885245006, "PPL/zlib": 4.495975597694412e-05, "Min-5%": 2.7284126001245834, "Min-10%": 1.3980036376811125, "Min-20%": 0.7029773338611321, "Min-30%": 0.46920865514229965, "Min-40%": 0.3524344965650741, "Min-50%": 0.28189378042867747, "Min-60%": 0.23486290408467428}, {"text": "ily married James. Along with their friends Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, the couple joined the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. She and her husband defied Lord Voldemort himself three times. Shortly afterwards, Lily and James had a son, Harry James Potter, of whom they made Sirius the godfather.   However, the family was forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Lord Voldemort and their infant son. It referred to a boy who would be born at the end of July in 1980, who had the power to defeat Lord Voldemort. She and James were betrayed by Pettigrew and were murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en night in 1981, while trying to protect their son.  Lily briefly appeared again through the Resurrection Stone to encourage Harry in his own sacrifice during the Battle of Hogwarts in May 1998. She appeared along with James, Sirius, and Remus. After the end of the Second Wizarding War, Lily had three grandchildren through her son: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter, the last of whom was named in memory of her.  Lily\nJ. Evans was born to Mr and Mrs Evans, two Muggles of the Evans family, on 30 January 1960. Her family lived in Cokeworth, England.[9] She had an older sister Petunia, whom she was quite close to. At the age of nine, Lily became friends with Severus Snape, who lived down in Spinner's End, which was within walking distance of the Evans' house. However, her family was apparently better off, since Petunia sneered at Snape for coming from that poverty-stricken neighbourhood.[3]  Snape telling Lily that she was a witch Severus was the first person to tell Lily that she was a witch, and he went on to teach Lily a great deal about the wizarding world while the two eagerly awaited the time when they could attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry together. Lily's magical abilities and friendship with Severus caused problems between the two sisters. Envying her sister's abilities, Petunia wrote to Albus Dumbledore, asking if she could attend Hogwarts with Lily. However, the headmaster kindly refused her petition. The letter was later found by Lily and Severus.[3]  At the age of eleven, Lily bought her wand from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. The wand was 10\u00bc inches, willow, \"swishy\", and according to Garrick Ollivander, good for charm work. Shortly before her depart to Hogwarts, Lily and Petunia argued about magic again. Her sister called her a \"freak\" for possess that power and said it was better that she went to that school so \"normal people\" would be safe.[3]  Lily being Sorted into Gryffindor house At the age of eleven, Lily started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was Sorted into Gryffindor house. She became quite skilled at Potions, attracting the attention of Professor Horace Slughorn, who made her a member of his Slug Club for the students that he considered talented and possibly successful in the future.  A memory Harry sees featuring Lily (in fifth year) standing up to James Potter In her fifth year, Lily stood up for her then best friend, Severus Snape, when he was being bullied by James Potter. Lily attempted to stop his bullying, addressing James only by his surname and vice versa in this moment. It is implied that such bullying had happened more than once. However, Snape lashed out at her in his humiliation, calling her a \"filthy Mudblood.\"[10]  He then begged for Lily's forgiveness, but she asked him if he still intended to join the Death Eaters. When he didn't deny this, Lily realised that Snape wasn't willing to change for her and didn't understand what was wrong with the Death Eaters. This led to a parting of ways between Lily and Snape, as the former had already become dismayed by Snape's fascination with the Dark Arts and friendship with his Slytherin house-mates Mulciber and Avery, both of whom were aspiring Death Eaters.[3]  By Lily's fifth year, James had developed a crush on her, but she didn't reciprocate, calling him an \"arrogant toerag\" because he bullied other students, particularly her best friend. James's\nbest friend, Sirius Black, later commented that James couldn't resist showing off and making a fool of himself whenever she was around.[10]  Lily with other members of the Slug Club towards the end of her education During their seventh year, James matured somewhat, proving himself to be responsible and brave. However, it is implied that he still had the desire to bully Snape, but was willing to stop actually doing it for Lily's sake. This led to her agreeing to go out with him; gaining genuine affection for him in the process. Due to their academic achievement, skill, and responsibility, the young couple eventually were chosen to be Head Boy and Head Girl.[11]  In late 1977, Lily and James had a disastrous first meeting with Petunia and her then-fianc\u00e9, Vernon Dursley,[9] which presumably took place over Christmas break, as they were both still at Hogwarts. When Vernon tried to impress James with his car, the wizard in turn boasted of his own material wealth, and a row ensued.[9] The evening ended with both Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears, with an ashamed James promising he'd apologise and make it up (which, due to his and Lily's untimely deaths, never happened).[9]  Petunia was married by the end of 1977. Lily and James were invited to the wedding, her sister refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, which upset her deeply.[9] At the reception, Vernon wouldn't talk to James, but described him as \"some magician\" within his earshot.[9]  After graduation, at only eighteen years old, James married Lily Evans and Sirius served as their best man at the wedding. It was a quiet ceremony because of the dangers of the First Wizarding War. Lily's older sister Petunia did not attend, for she was highly against Lily being a witch and marrying a wizard.  It is highly likely that Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew attended, as they were best friends of James. Both James' parents, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter attended the wedding.[12] It's unknown as to whether either of Lily's parents attended as well.  Lily and her husband as members of the original Order Living off James' family fortune, the Potters became full-time members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, along with their friends Sirius, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.[13] During the war, Lily and James defied Voldemort on at least three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them.[14]  James and Lily Potter's in 1979 shortly after getting married Lily became pregnant in the autumn of 1979. Around the same time,[15] Sybill Trelawney made a prophecy in front of Albus Dumbledore, predicting that \"the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches\" and would be \"born to those who have thrice defied him\".[16] The first part of the prophecy was overheard by Lily's friend, Snape, who had since become a Death Eater.[17] He loyally reported what he had\nheard to his master, but became horrified when Voldemort came to believe that Lily's son was the subject of the prophecy.[17][3]  It was the threat to Lily that led Snape to change sides, warning Dumbledore of the Dark Lord's plans, and vowing to do anything to keep the woman he still loved safe. It was Snape's continuing devotion to Lily, that made Dumbledore certain of his double agent's true loyalties.   Lily with her husband and infant son The Potters went into hiding while Lily was still pregnant.[13] Their son, Harry James Potter, was born on 31 July,", "PPL": 0.15017224848270416, "PPL/lower": 0.2842246582920905, "PPL/zlib": 4.4921402477626136e-05, "Min-5%": 2.90990679243616, "Min-10%": 1.494294340621826, "Min-20%": 0.7503037956892797, "Min-30%": 0.5005107347854241, "Min-40%": 0.3754141875212928, "Min-50%": 0.3003134478967411, "Min-60%": 0.25044201978775643}, {"text": "demort's eyes, and the Dark Lord may gave Lucius's son a nearly impossible task to punish Lucius.[54]  Although he broke Lucius out of Azkaban in 1997, along with many other Death Eaters, Voldemort treated him with disdain, taking over his home and his wand, and mocking the Malfoys for their relation to a werewolf through Narcissa's niece. Lucius was desperate to regain his master's favour, but the opportunity for that came with the capture of Harry Potter in the spring of 1998 and, unfortunately for him, ended in disaster; Harry and his friends escaped, and the Malfoys were severely punished. By the Battle of Hogwarts, Lucius had abandoned his loyalty to Voldemort in order to protect his family, and was pardoned for his crimes due to his last-minute defection.[55]  Draco mentioned many years later that Lucius never wanted to use the \"true\" Time-Turner to save Voldemort, as he probably preferred a world without him, suggesting that even Lucius despised the Dark Lord in the end, particularly due to the ill treatment Voldemort had given to the Malfoy family at their later half of their Death Eater services.  Albus Dumbledore, his enemy Lucius Malfoy had a strong dislike of Albus Dumbledore. This is due to two reasons \u2013 Dumbledore believed in Muggle rights which contradicted Malfoy's pure blood supremacist beliefs. In addition, Lucius was a Death Eater, so he believed that Lord Voldemort was a much more powerful wizard than Dumbledore. Lucius always believed that Dumbledore becoming Headmaster was the worst thing that happened to Hogwarts. Dumbledore was Headmaster at least part of Lucius's schooltime as Lucius was in his sixth or seventh year when the Marauders started at Hogwarts and then Dumbledore was already Headmaster.  In 1992, Lucius Malfoy was indirectly responsible for the second opening of the Chamber of Secrets. This was an attempt to discredit Arthur Weasley but Lucius also wanted to include Dumbledore by using the excuse of blaming him for doing nothing to stop the Chamber's opening. Lucius abused his position as a Hogwarts Governor and threatened the other Governors to vote for Dumbledore's suspension after several attacks on Hogwarts students. However, when Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber to lure Harry Potter, the other Governors decided to face Malfoy and Dumbledore was reinstated. Lucius was furious that Dumbledore dared to return to Hogwarts to help Harry successfully save Ginny, but Dumbledore was aware that Lucius had threatened the other Governors. Consequently, Lucius was sacked as a Hogwarts Governor.  In the following years, Lucius continued to dislike Dumbledore and cause trouble for him. When Voldemort was resurrected in 1995, Lucius returned to his service. As the Ministry was refusing to believe Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, they started a smear campaign to discredit him. Lucius contributed to this smear campaign by describing Dumbledore as \"eccentric\" for his past choice of teachers including the werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and ex-Auror Alastor Moody. Later that year, Lucius participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and fought against\nthe Order of the Phoenix. However, he was arrested and sent to Azkaban.  Dumbledore believed that Lucius would feel \"safe\" in Azkaban because Voldemort was furious at Lucius's failure in the Department of Mysteries, and Dumbledore offered to protect Lucius along with Narcissa when Draco threatened to murder the headmaster. It is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learned of Dumbledore's death.  Harry Potter, his enemy Lucius was the father of Draco Malfoy, Harry's school bully. During their first years at Hogwarts, Lucius discouraged their rivalry, feeling it wouldn't reflect well on them to be on poor terms with such a famous person. When Lucius first met Harry in Flourish and Blotts in 1992, he pretended to be polite to him.   After Harry succeeded in killing the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, he confronted Lucius about his suspicions on how Ginny obtained the diary at the beginning of the year and then tricked him into freeing his own servant Dobby. Lucius was furious and from that point on, treated him with cool contempt. Lucius was a little bit more tactful around Harry than other Death Eaters (such as Bellatrix Lestrange) depending on the circumstances. However, Lucius did not openly declare himself against him until after Lord Voldemort took control of the Ministry.  During the Battle of Hogwarts, the Malfoy family switched sides, meaning they were forgiven for their crimes. Draco, while he did not necessarily become \"friends\" with Harry, ultimately made peace with him. Lucius did the same as well, or at least simply decided to leave Harry and his friends and family alone.  Cornelius Fudge, his former associate Cornelius Fudge was easily and strongly swayed by money and power. As a result, he favoured people like Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy influenced and likely bribed Cornelius Fudge many times during the latter's tenure as Minister for Magic, in return receiving favours such as delays in laws and given classified information. In the summer of 1994, Fudge invited Malfoy to occupy the top box with him at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final, thanks to his \"generous\" donations to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.  In 1995, Lucius returned to Voldemort, but Fudge denied Voldemort's rebirth and insisted that Malfoy had switched sides, and the wealthy Malfoy continued to work with the Ministry. They met after Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing and went upstairs to Fudge's office, where Harry suspected Lucius gave gold to Fudge. Malfoy's frequent visits to Fudge also may have given him opportunity to put Ministry workers (such as Broderick Bode and Sturgis Podmore) under the Imperius Curse to attempt to steal a prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort.[28]  After the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge was forced to believe that Voldemort had indeed returned, and all the Death Eaters who took part on the battle (with the exception of Bellatrix Lestrange) were sentenced to Azkaban, among them being Lucius. After being imprisoned, Lucius lost his job and influence at the Ministry; Fudge, having been blind to Lucius's true intentions\nuntil it was too late, also lost his career and popularity as well.  Rubeus Hagrid, an enemy Rubeus Hagrid was not on good terms with the Malfoy family. He was disgusted with their pure blood supremacy, their bullying of Muggle-borns and blood traitors, their allegiance to Lord Voldemort and their disrespect to Albus Dumbledore, whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal to. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, referring to him as an \"oaf\".  In particular, Hagrid disliked Lucius. In 1992, Hagrid had to separate Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy from fighting in Flourish and Blotts. During the 1992\u20131993 school year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened. Lucius was indirectly responsible for the Chamber's opening. However, Hagrid was blamed because he had been framed by Tom Riddle for the Chamber's first opening fifty years before. As a result, Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by Cornelius Fudge. Lucius was present at Hagrid's arrest, although Hagrid reacted angrily to his presence and ordered him to get out of his house.   Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how he called his small hut a \"house\". Lucius was only present at Hagrid's arrest because he had to inform Dumbledore that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and shouted at him accusing him of threatening the other governors. Lucius's response was to mock Hagrid's temper and advising him not to shout at Azkaban guards like that. This instance proved that Hagrid did not trust Lucius. Lucius described Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid as a teacher as \"", "PPL": 0.12458071112632751, "PPL/lower": 0.32746637450161126, "PPL/zlib": 3.803991179429848e-05, "Min-5%": 2.4031798512327907, "Min-10%": 1.2398014713955277, "Min-20%": 0.6223687776529474, "Min-30%": 0.4150631562091868, "Min-40%": 0.3116876036807178, "Min-50%": 0.24926482596201965, "Min-60%": 0.20766329984520787}, {"text": "weird if you let it be weird\", to which he responded \"Received and totally understood\".

He was a staunch believer in the equality of all magical and Muggle folk and was the head of the Weasley family.  Arthur was born to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (n\u00e9e Black) and had two brothers. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. Soon after graduating, Arthur married Molly Prewett. During the First Wizarding War, he and Molly had seven children: sons Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and Ron, as well as their daughter Ginny. He was not a member of the Order of the Phoenix during this period, and it is unknown if he participated in\nany way in the First Wizarding War. At some point after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur began working for the Ministry, in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.  In 1996, he was promoted to head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects by the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. When the Second Wizarding War began, Arthur joined the Order. While guarding the Department of Mysteries, he was attacked by Lord Voldemort's pet snake Nagini, but he made a full recovery. Arthur participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters (1997) and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), in which he suffered the devastating loss of his son Fred; however, he survived the war.  After the war, he saw his family expand even further with the addition of twelve grandchildren, through the marriage of many of his surviving children and eventually named Head of Department.[12]  Arthur Weasley was born on 6 February[1] 1950[2] to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (n\u00e9e Black).[14] His mother was disowned for marrying a \"blood traitor,\" as her family believed strongly in the notion of pure-blood supremacy. Arthur had two brothers.[15]  He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. In his third year in 1963, he may have chosen to take Muggle Studies, due to his interest in Muggles. While at school, he met and began dating fellow Gryffindor Molly Prewett. Arthur got caught out of bed by the school caretaker Apollyon Pringle after he and Molly went for a night-time stroll one evening and was severely punished.[16]  The Burrow, located on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur and Molly married. Their marriage was rather rushed, as Lord Voldemort was gaining power during that time and the First Wizarding War began.[17] Arthur was not a member of the first Order of the Phoenix. It is unknown if he was otherwise involved in the war, although he was familiar with the Death Eaters' use of the Imperius Curse and the trouble it caused the Ministry of Magic at the time.[18] During the course of the war, he and Molly had seven children: Bill in late 1970, Charlie in 1972, Percy in 1976, twins Fred and George in 1978, Ron in 1980, and the first daughter to be born into the Weasley family in generations, Ginny, in 1981.  The war ended soon after Ginny's birth, but not before Arthur's brothers-in-law Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both Order members, were killed by Death Eaters.[19] Arthur was upset when some Death Eaters, such as Lucius Malfoy, were able to escape punishment by claiming that they had been under the Imperius Curse. Arthur believed they were lying, and he and Lucius were hostile towards one another whenever they crossed paths.  At some point between his graduation from Hogwarts and 1992, Arthur gained employment in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic. He also purchased a Muggle car,", "PPL": 0.21511945128440857, "PPL/lower": 0.26422124327944835, "PPL/zlib": 7.851074864394473e-05, "Min-5%": 4.1239923928298206, "Min-10%": 2.1404829725221384, "Min-20%": 1.0744588947137659, "Min-30%": 0.716696970885072, "Min-40%": 0.5381967966943042, "Min-50%": 0.4304137847550796, "Min-60%": 0.35858114512213096}, {"text": "- J.

Once Lucius and his family lost favour with Voldemort the other Death Eaters largely lost any respect they had towards Lucius, even loudly jeering at him when Voldemort mentioned their relation by marriage to werewolf Remus Lupin (through Lucius's niece Nymphadora Tonks).  Peter Pettigrew worked alongside Lucius in keeping prisoners in the Malfoy Manor. They also stood next to each other in the Death Eater circle following Voldemort's rebirth. Lucius and Peter's Hogwarts years would have overlapped. The relationship between the two is unknown beyond this, although Pettigrew was assigned to work in the dungeons in Malfoy Manor as a servant, meaning he possibly had a low opinion of him.  Barty Crouch Jnr was a highly loyal Death Eater who had a strong dislike towards Lucius for never attempting to search\nfor Voldemort after he disappeared. While disguised as Alastor Moody at Hogwarts, Barty enjoyed intimidating Lucius's son Draco.  Corban Yaxley seemed familiar with Lucius and his wealthy and extravagant lifestyle, though he expressed this in a snide manner.  Igor Karkaroff was a friend and comrade of Lucius's during the First Wizarding War. Lucius considered sending his son to Durmstrang due to Karkaroff's headmastership and the fact that Durmstrang doesn't allow muggle-born wizards and witches to attend.  Lucius appeared to be friendly with Crabbe and Nott, as their sons were familiar with each other prior to arriving at Hogwarts. Nott visited the Malfoy Manor on at least one occasion to discuss unknown things with Lucius. Despite this, Lucius didn't hesitate to leave an injured Nott behind during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, knowing that Voldemort would be much angrier at losing the prophecy.  Lucius shared at least some of his Hogwarts years with Avery, Mulciber, Evan Rosier, Wilkes, and Rodolphus Lestrange. He and Rodolphus were brother-in-laws through their marriages with Naricissa and Bellatrix respectively. Lucius also chose Mulciber as his partner during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.  Lucius was disdainful towards werewolf Fenrir Greyback when he brought Harry Potter and his friends to the Malfoy Manor. Greyback was likewise resentful of the Malfoy's cold reception and argued with Lucius over who would receive credit for capturing Harry.

She personally destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup using a Basilisk's fang. She later witnessed Harry's defeat of Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.  However, Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort, truly seeing him for the first time during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin's Locket whilst travelling with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1997. The Horcrux locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of time, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry's likenesses in emotionally torturing Ron, reflecting Ron's deepest fears of Hermione preferring Harry to him. Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Tom Riddle, the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends.   Although they had very little direct contact, Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar: both are \"model students\" who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her\nseventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family.  Bellatrix Lestrange, a hated enemy Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort's most fanatically loyal followers; Hermione initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Longbottom, though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Sirius Black at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in 1996.  During the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a \"blood traitor,\" Ron Weasley was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Godric Gryffindor's Sword. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word \"mudblood\" on Hermione's arm,[68] as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse.[10] Hermione later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. She expressed disgust at having to  use Bellatrix's wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix committed with it. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by Molly Weasley, who eventually killed Bellatrix herself, avenging Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, Nymphadora Tonks, and Dobby the house-elf in the process, among others.  Draco Malfoy, her school bully Draco Malfoy, of an old and wealthy pure-blood family with Death Eater ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and thus treated Hermione with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron, who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Draco in school marks, for which his father berated him.[4] Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term \"Mudblood,\" which usually set off the tempers of her friends \u2014 and the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992[4] \u2014 but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same.   Occasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak, for which Draco was largely responsible.[33]  In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione, Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998, avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences, Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Albus Potter.[10] He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Draco's civility\ntowards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister for Magic in Britain at the time, and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius.  Pansy Parkinson Pansy Parkinson was more or less Hermione's polar opposite: where Hermione was compassionate (as seen when she founded SPEW), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as Hagrid), and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy's more sycophantic lackeys. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione, Harry, and Ron at any given opportunity, though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Harry to Lord Voldemort shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a \"cow\", and \"thicker than a concussed troll\".[31]  Rita Skeeter While covering the Triwizard Tournament in Hermione's fourth year, Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Harry Potter and his friends, including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half-giant. Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this. After Hermione insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and Viktor Krum. This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus.  Hermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task. Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle. Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.  When the Ministry of Magic began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Harry, Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita, this time into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again.

Arthur with Mr and Mrs Granger in Flourish and Blotts Arthur was fascinated at how Muggles were able to go about their lives without magic. Whenever he found himself in close proximity to them, he had a hard time containing his enthusiasm. During Harry's stays at the Burrow, he liked to sit next to Harry, in order to ask him questions about living with them and had at various times attempted to engage the Dursleys in conversation about electricity. In 1992, when he learned Harry had never travelled by the Floo Network, he joyfully began to ask about the \"escapators\" in the London Underground. When the Weasleys and Harry met Hermione Granger in Diagon Alley that same year, Arthur was ecstatic to meet Hermione's parents, both Muggles, who were exchanging money at Gringotts. While the other family members went shopping for school supplies, Arthur insisted on taking Mr and Mrs Granger for a drink in the Leaky Cauldron.[20]  In addition to his Ford Anglia, Arthur also collected a number of other Muggle items. He had a large collection of plugs and batteries, as well as other undisclosed items in his shed. After successfully transporting Harry to the Burrow in the aftermath of the Battle of the Seven Potters, Arthur showed Harry the remains of Sirius' motorcycle and told him he was eager to learn how the brakes worked and that he also wanted to put it back together when Molly was not around. In time, Arthur did put it back together and returned it to Harry.[9] When given the chance to use matches to light a bonfire, Arthur enjoyed it immensely, even though he was not successful.  Harry Potter surrounded by Arthur's collection of Muggle objects Because of his fondness for Muggles, in 1992, he drafted a proposition for the Ministry called the Muggle Protection Act. Many pure-blood wizards took offence to this, and Lucius Malfoy attempted to sabotage Arthur's plans; by planting Riddle's diary on Arthur's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and bury the legislation.[20] So adamant in protecting Muggles, he was outraged at Fred and George's prank on Dudley Dursley, even though the twins did not target Dudley because he was a Muggle, but rather he was a horrible boy.   When he took his family, Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, he was adamant about remaining incognito. He insisted on putting up their tents by hand and cooking their food outside with a fire. While somewhat familiar with the concept, he had trouble with a Muggle\nmatchbox; he would light a match and subsequently drop it in surprise. In the end, he managed to get the fire lit with Hermione's help and seemed to have a great time. When Death Eaters started a riot after the cup, Arthur was one of the people who acted to protect Muggle victims.[16]  His wall in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office was covered with Muggle pictures, including several of Muggle cars (one of which was a disassembled motor) Muggle post boxes, which he appeared to have cut out of a Muggle children's book and a diagram of how to wire a plug. His greatest ambition was to find out how Muggles were able to keep aeroplanes airborne. Arthur's love of engineering and Muggle technology was inherited by his sons Fred and George in that they too possessed Arthur's ingenuity and almost compulsive need to invent or modify things from their intended purposes, resulting in many of the twins' joke items.  Arthur's wand Arthur was the son of Septimus and Cedrella Weasley. They were both pure-bloods, although Cedrella was disowned by her family, because she married a blood-traitor. The relationship between them is unknown; it is possible that his father's point of view made Arthur realise that there was no difference between wizards and Muggles. Arthur also had at least two brothers.  The Weasley family Arthur eventually married Molly Prewett, whom he had been dating since Hogwarts, and they had seven children; Bill, Charlie, Percy, the twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron, and Ginny. Arthur was less strict than his wife, and his children thought he was funny. He had a good relationship with all of them, before his son Percy became angry with him. However, during the Second Wizarding War, Arthur appeared to have been more protective, because he was afraid of what happened to his children.  His son Bill was a very good student; he had become prefect and Head Boy during his years at Hogwarts. He later worked for Gringotts in Egypt and married Fleur Delacour.  Charlie was also a good student; he was prefect and Captain for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He studied dragons in Romania, but he never married.  He also had a good relationship with Percy, but their relationship was broken up in 1995. Percy was more serious than his father, and they both worked for the Ministry of Magic, although Percy loved to obey the rules and was also very ambitious. Arthur forgave his son in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts when Percy was ready to apologise for his previous actions.  His sense of humour was similar to Fred and George's. He loved them very much, and, although they were not model students, Arthur knew they were very clever wizards. Though not as strict towards their mischievous behaviour, a few rare exceptions are when they attempted an Unbreakable Vow with Ron in their earlier years, in 1994 when they left a Ton-Tongue Toffee for Dudley Dursley to have, and in 1995, when he agreed with his wife\non their irresponsible use of magic ever since they had come of age. Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts; Arthur was grief-stricken over his death.  Arthur with his youngest son Ron in 1997 Arthur was very protective of Ron and Ginny, who were his youngest children. Ginny was the youngest and the only daughter. When she was possessed by a memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, in a diary, Arthur was very upset; he shouted at Ginny, saying that he had told her not to trust magical objects that had a mind of their own. He also helped Ron to his mission; he hexed the family ghoul, along with Fred and George, in order to make it look like Ron, who had gone to help Harry and Hermione find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.  After the Second Wizarding War, Arthur's family extended even more, through his children; he appeared to have at least twelve grandchildren: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, who were the children of Bill and Fleur; Molly and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's children; Fred and Roxanne who were the children of George and Angelina Johnson; Rose and Hugo, who were Ron and Hermione's children; and James, Albus and Lily, who were Ginny and Harry's children. He had a good relationship with his grandchildren, but, according to Ron (who may or may not have been joking), he would not let them marry any pure-bloods.  Harry Potter, his future son-in-law Harry Potter was Ron's best friend. He met Arthur in 1992, at the Burrow. Arthur liked to discuss Muggle things with Harry Potter and had entrusted Harry with certain information that many felt him too young to understand, such as in 1993 when the Ministry would not tell Harry that they thought Sirius Black was going to seek him out. Harry had also saved Arthur's life once when Harry saw him being attacked by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries before Christmas of 1995. They fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts, and both survived the Second Wizarding War.  As Molly once said that Harry was like a son to her, it is possible that Arthur felt the same way. Arthur became like a father to Harry. Harry married Arthur's daughter Ginny and became Arthur's only son-in-law. He also had three children with Ginny, who are some of Arthur's many grandchildren: James, Albus, and Lily.

She remained loyal to her school and to the D.A., returning after she had graduated to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts.  Cho survived the Second Wizarding War and eventually married a Muggle.[2]  Cho was born into a wizarding family,[1] the daughter of Mr. and Mrs Chang between September 1978 and August 1979. She became a great Quidditch fan at the age of six, and cheered for the Tutshill Tornados.  In 1990, at the age of eleven, Cho began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Ravenclaw house. She soon tried out for her house Quidditch team, and attained the position of Seeker. She became friends with fellow Ravenclaw Marietta Edgecombe.  Cho during her time at Hogwarts, outside the owlery During a Gryffindor-Ravenclaw Quidditch match in her fourth year, Cho first met Harry Potter, who was a year below her and a fellow Seeker. Harry noticed she was very pretty and she made his stomach\n\"feel funny\". Cho's impression of Harry was favourable, and when she later wished Harry good luck before Gryffindor had a Quidditch match against Slytherin, Harry went bright red.  During the match against Ravenclaw, Cho began to tail Harry rather than find the Golden Snitch herself. Harry soon caught on to her strategy and attempted to trick her into thinking he had spotted the Snitch. As he dove, he saw the Snitch for real. Cho then gasped at the sight of a trio of Dementors.  Harry managed to unleash a powerful Patronus Charm as well as snag the Snitch; the dementors were actually: Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, and Marcus Flint in disguise. Ravenclaw did not win the Quidditch Cup that year with Gryffindor winning it instead of Slytherin.[7]  Cho sitting next to Fleur Delacour after the arrival of Beauxbatons On 25 August 1994, Cho went to the Quidditch World Cup Finals, presumably with her family. While there, she exchanged greetings with Harry Potter, who had a crush on Cho by this time, having been developing feelings for her since the previous year when he first saw her during a Quidditch match against the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. He considered her to be very pretty and a good Seeker.  She was friendly towards Harry throughout the year, but probably did not return his romantic feelings. She had already accepted Cedric Diggory's request to be his date to the Yule Ball. Cedric was a year above Cho and a champion in the Triwizard Tournament.  Cho and Cedric dancing at the Yule Ball Despite this, Cho refused to treat Harry poorly, as the majority of the school did because the Goblet of Fire had also selected him; she refused to wear one of Draco Malfoy's Support Cedric Diggory badges, something Harry was grateful for. He asked Cho to attend the Yule Ball with him, and she let him down kindly, even apologising for being unable to accept his offer; he still spent most of the ball watching Cho, who either soon began or was already dating Cedric. She was the 'thing' Cedric would miss most and thus became his hostage during the Second Task of the Tournament; he employed the Bubble-Head Charm to save her from Hogwarts' lake.[8]  That June, Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders. Cho was devastated and openly cried at the memorial service at the end of the school year.  Cedric's death made Cho believe Harry's claim that Voldemort had returned despite the Ministry of Magic and Daily Prophet branding him a liar or insane. She sought Harry out several times and attempted to engage him in conversation, probably motivated by both a desire to learn the circumstances of Cedric's death and a growing fondness for Harry. Unfortunately for Harry, these encounters did not go well. The first time Cho found him covered with Stinksap that was accidentally let off by Neville Longbottom's Mimbulus mimbletonia. The second time, she ended up arguing with Ron Weasley about Quidditch teams. On the third\ntry, when Cho entered the Owlery to send a letter to her mother for her birthday while Harry was there, she defended him from a suspicious Argus Filch.[6]  Cho training with Dumbledore's Army When invited by Hermione Granger to join Dumbledore's Army, Cho went against the advice of her parents, who wished her to remain on Dolores Umbridge's good side, as her mother worked at the Ministry. She also brought her best friend and fellow Ravenclaw Marietta Edgecombe along, despite the other girl's reluctance to join due to her mum's position at the Ministry as well. Cho joined because she was determined to fight against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters after what happened to Cedric in the previous year.[6]  However, as a D.A. student she had her ups and downs. At first, she got nervous and performed her spells poorly whenever Harry was nearby. This indicated that her romantic feelings for him had grown since the previous year. Later, though, she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the shape of a swan. However, she did have some trouble with a Disarming Charm, saying Expellimellius instead of the actual incantation, causing Marietta's sleeve to catch on fire. She also mentioned that she had never been able to stun anything before Harry taught her and commented that he was a good teacher.[6]  The kiss between Cho and Harry Cho initiated a kiss with Harry under some mistletoe shortly before Christmas after a D.A. session. However, she soon ended up in tears, confused and guilty because of her conflicting feelings for Harry and Cedric. This kiss was something that Harry did not enjoy much and described as being \"wet\", because of all the tears and a repeat kiss did not happen. Despite this, she and Harry went on a date in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade on Valentine's Day where the couple sent their time at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. The tea shop made Harry uncomfortable, as it reminded him of Umbridge's too pink office.[6]  Harry and Cho on a date inside Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop Cho's continuing grief over Cedric's death, her ill-founded jealousy over Harry's friendship with Hermione Granger (who, ironically, tried to advise Harry on how to handle girls), and Harry's overall inexperience with girls soured the experience. Cho became jealous when Harry mentioned his plans to meet Hermione later in the day, and she tried to gauge Harry's feelings for her by mentioning that Roger Davies had asked her out, but this only bewildered Harry. She ended up in tears after Harry refused to discuss Cedric's death with her.[6]  Later in the year, Cho's friend Marietta betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge, and, as a result, was afflicted by the jinx performed by Hermione on the piece of parchment, signed earlier by all members of the D.A. The hex made purple pustules spell 'SNEAK' across her face that could not be removed, something Cho considered a 'horrible trick'. When Harry scorned Marietta for the betrayal and Cho defended her, their relationship went downhill.[6] \nAt the beginning of her seventh and final year at Hogwarts, Cho caught a glimpse of Harry on the Hogwarts Express. She did not speak with him, instead hiding back in her compartment with Marietta Edgecombe. Harry commented that she was the only one not staring at him, he also noticed that her friend Marietta still had the word SNEAK written in pimples on her face.[9]  Cho and others standing at the base of the Astronomy Tower after Dumbledore's death Harry and Cho had almost no interaction for the rest of the year; according to Harry, they simply 'fell apart', too embarrassed to even look at one another.[9] That year Harry began dating Ginny Weasley, while Cho dated Michael Corner,[6] who coincidentally had previously dated Ginny and had then offered Cho comfort after their sixth year Quidditch House Cup loss.

Enraged that Harry not only escaped trouble, but was instead rewarded, he challenged Harry to a wizard's duel. In spite of Hermione's attempt to dissuade them from breaking the school rules, (or perhaps because of it), Harry accepted the challenge.  The trio trespassing in the restricted third-floor corridor As they left the tower, the trio found Neville (whose wrist had been fixed by Madam Pomfrey) waiting outside, having forgotten the password. Neville decided to go with them and the four arrived at the Trophy Room (the site of the duel), but Malfoy was nowhere to be found. They speculated that he may have chickened out and were deciding what to do next when they heard the school caretaker Argus Filch and his cat, Mrs Norris, enter the room. Realising that Draco tricked them and informed Filch of their location, they attempted to quietly exit the room. A nearby doorknob rattled and Peeves, Hogwarts' resident poltergeist, burst into the hallway, threatening to expose them.[83]  The trio encountering Fluffy, a three-headed dog, guarding a trap door Growing desperate, Ron took a swipe at Peeves, who began to bellow their whereabouts as loud as he could, attracting Filch. The four kids ran right to the end of the corridor, where they found themselves stopped by a locked door, which Hermione opened with the Unlocking Charm using Harry's wand. They hurried inside, thinking themselves out of danger until turning around and coming face-to-face with a monstrous sight: a giant three-headed dog. Choosing Filch over death, the children ran for it, somehow managing to get back to their dormitory without running into anyone along the way. Though shaken by the night's events, Harry's interest in exploring was piqued by Hermione's pointing out that the dog was standing on a trapdoor.  Harry receiving a Nimbus 2000, a gift from Professor McGonagall Over breakfast the next morning, Harry and Ron were discussing what Fluffy could be guarding when the mail arrived. Harry, who had received no mail apart from Hagrid's letter, was intrigued as everyone else by the long, oddly-shaped package in the mail that morning, and was even more surprised than the others when he discovered what was inside: a Nimbus 2000, and with a note from Professor McGonagall warning him not to open the package at the table, and that he was to meet\nWood that night for Quidditch practice.   Taking the broom up to their dormitory, Harry and Ron were stopped by Malfoy, who seized the package and told Harry that first-year students are not allowed their own brooms. When Professor Flitwick walked up to them, he tried to report Harry, but Flitwick, who had been told of Harry's special permission, just expressed admiration for Harry's talent.  A Hallowe'en lesson on the Levitation Charm On Hallowe'en, Professor Flitwick began teaching his students how to perform the Levitation Charm. Only Hermione succeeded; offended by her air of superiority, Ron later made a nasty comment that she overheard. The comment was about her lack of friends, causing her to run off to lock herself in the girl's bathroom in tears and making him and Harry feel slightly guilty. When the two went down to the Hallowe'en feast later, their guilt was forgotten amidst the splendour of the decorations.  Partway into the feast, Quirrell arrived to announce that there was a twelve-foot Mountain Troll in the dungeons before fainting where he stood. The prefects led the students back to their dorms, but Harry realised that Hermione did not know about the troll and convinced Ron to help save her, since they were responsible. They sneaked off to the girl's bathroom to warn Hermione, locking the troll inside. However, they did not realise their mistake until they heard Hermione's terrified scream emanate from the bathroom. A horrified Harry and Ron ran back into the bathroom to rescue her. After a brief skirmish, during which Harry stuck his wand up the troll's nose, Ron finally knocked the troll out, by levitating the troll's own club to smash into its head.  The mountain troll in the bathroom, where Hermione was hiding Attracted by the troll's yells, the teachers arrived to find Harry, Ron, and Hermione covered in dust, and the bathroom in disarray. Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, began scolding the boys for not going straight to their dormitories with the rest of their house, but instead putting themselves in grave danger. Much to Harry and Ron's surprise, Hermione lied to McGonagall and told her that she had gone looking for the troll, as she thought she could handle them. She claimed that Harry and Ron were looking for her, (which was true), and she would most likely be dead if the boys had failed to rescue her (also true). The three bonded over the shared experience, and were friends thereafter.  As the Quidditch season began, Harry became increasingly nervous. The first match of the season was against Slytherin. Harry was under increasing pressure to show that he was not just a famous name. In an attempt to calm his nerves, Harry borrowed a book entitled Quidditch Through the Ages, a book that was comprehensive history of the sport, that Hermione must have checked out from the library. During break on the day before the match, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were huddled together around a jar of flames, which had been conjured by Hermione, to\nkeep warm.  Harry noticing the blood on Snape's robes and a slight limp when he walked Snape noticed their guilty faces, and looking for a reason to punish them, confiscated Harry's book on the feeble pretext that library books were not to be taken outside. Harry noticed that Snape was limping, as though his leg was injured, strengthening his suspicions that the Potions Master was after whatever it was that Fluffy was guarding. Nervous about the next day's match, Harry decided to ask Snape for the book back; realising that he would most likely be in the staffroom and that it would be harder for Snape to bully him if there were other teachers around, Harry decided to confront him. Approaching the door, Harry overheard Snape complaining to Filch about Fluffy. After opening the door, Harry saw Filch helping Snape to bandage his leg. He returned to the Common Room and then told his two friends everything he had seen.  Harry playing in his first Quidditch match against Slytherin Harry had little time to dwell on Snape's injury as the first Quidditch match began the very next morning. Harry's job as being the Gryffindor Seeker was to catch the Golden Snitch. The snitch is a walnut-sized gold ball, that is extremely fast and difficult to see. The entire match rested upon the retrieval of the Snitch. Harry's first attempt to catch the Snitch was foiled when the Slytherin Seeker blatched him. Though the Seeker was penalised, the move succeeded in stopping Harry from getting to the Snitch.  Soon after, Harry's broom began bucking uncontrollably as if trying to unseat him. The bucking became even more violent with each passing second, until Harry was hanging from the broom with just one hand. As the crowd looked on with horror, some of the professors had their wands at the ready should he fall. Ron and Hermione began to wonder if the other was at fault. That is until Hagrid, who had arrived to watch the game, noted that it would take powerful dark magic to make a broomstick so hard to manage, magic that powerful was well above the level of a second year and therefore had to have been cast by a qualified wizard. This announcement did nothing to help the worried friends.  Harry catching the Snitch and winning the opening match against Slytherin Hermione, who had turned her gaze away from Harry, and was scanning the stands, noticed that Snape was staring unblinkingly at Harry and muttering non-stop under his breath. Thinking quickly, Hermione took advantage of the fact that everyone's attention was now focused on Harry (and the Weasley twins' attempts to rescue him) to run around the entire stadium, knocking over Professor Quirrell, and ending up behind Snape. Muttering a few \"well-chosen words\" Hermione lit Snape's robes on fire with Bluebell Flames; a yell of shock told her she had", "PPL": 0.22502297163009644, "PPL/lower": 0.291108034616578, "PPL/zlib": 6.283802614635477e-05, "Min-5%": 4.245566054302103, "Min-10%": 2.231845101889442, "Min-20%": 1.123205052977906, "Min-30%": 0.7495043324992965, "Min-40%": 0.5629325510683091, "Min-50%": 0.45022278297125823, "Min-60%": 0.37508869259266986}, {"text": " After securing Slytherin's locket, the three friends took turns wearing it, to ensure it was not lost. The locket had a negative influence on all of them, straining relations and causing them to all act moody and inclined to get into petty arguments. They overheard a goblin saying that the sword protected by Snape was a fake. They learned that the Sword of Gryffindor in Snape's office was a copy of the real sword, and that they would have to trace the\nlocation of the real sword.  Harry and Ron Weasley rowing before Ron abandoned the hunt Harry and Hermione were excited at knowing what object they could use to destroy Horcruxes, but the locket's negative energy pushed Ron over the edge. Knowing that they now had something they were not close to destroying, Ron and Harry got into a horrible row. Ron accused Harry of not knowing what he was doing and not being very concerned when they learned that Ginny Weasley had been punished for attempting to steal Gryffindor's sword for them, along with Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood. Ron then abandoned his friends accusing Hermione of preferring Harry to himself.  Ron's departure left both Harry and Hermione depressed. Once he left, Harry and Hermione left the camping site they were last in. Hermione tied her scarf on a tree for a reason. With the locket in hand they Apparated away to Malham Cove.  They set up the tent and Harry stared into the sunset before dark. Hermione was listening to music in which Harry noticed and came in. Hermione was even more depressed as her boyfriend left them. Harry offered Hermione a dance in which she took and they danced until the song ended, they were happy for that moment.  Harry and Hermione discussing, they should go to Godric's Hollow That morning, Harry sat in his tent bed and watched his Golden Snitch and kissed it, revealing it was made from Flesh Memory. He went to Hermione and told her this, to which she replied that she noticed the Sign of the Deathly Hallows in her copy. They decided to head to Godric's Hollow, as Harry wanted to visit his parents' graves, and Hermione had convinced herself that Dumbledore might have entrusted the Sword of Gryffindor to Bathilda Bagshot, a magical historian who lived there and who had been friendly with the Potters and the Dumbledores.  Harry and Hermione visiting James and Lily's grave while in Godric's Hollow They arrived on Christmas Eve. After seeing the memorial dedicated to his parents and himself, Harry and Hermione searched the graveyard for the Potters's grave and came across the grave of Kendra and Ariana Dumbledore and that of Ignotus Peverell. Harry was filled with regret that Dumbledore had not shared this connection with him. Upon discovering Harry's parents' grave Hermione called out to him and comforted Harry when he reached the grave. After placing a conjured wreath of flowers on his parents' graves, the two then met Bathilda Bagshot, who motioned for them to follow her into her home. Believing Bathilda wanted to give him Gryffindor's Sword, Harry accompanied her upstairs alone when she indicated that Hermione should stay downstairs.  Nagini attacking Harry in Bathilda Bagshot's cottage Once there, she questioned Harry in what he did not realise was Parseltongue, revealing herself to in fact be Nagini, Voldemort's snake. Voldemort had murdered Bathilda and animated her corpse to hide Nagini, who attacked Harry, biting and coiling herself around Harry. Hermione raced upstairs and repelled the snake, while\nHarry's scar burned, alerting him to Voldemort's approach. The pair managed to escape, but Harry was knocked unconscious and such a close call with Voldemort caused the connection to re-open and Harry had a vision of his parents' demise. And in the scuffle, Harry's wand was accidentally broken by Hermione's Blasting Curse.   After escaping Voldemort, Harry and Hermione camped out in the Forest of Dean, where Hermione healed Nagini's bite with Dittany. When they were camped out there, Harry and Hermione read parts of Rita Skeeter's biography of Dumbledore, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore which Hermione had stolen from the home of Bathilda Bagshot. Upon reading, Harry felt betrayed and hurt, because Dumbledore had not shared this information with him. Hermione tried to convince Harry that Dumbledore had his best interests at heart, but Harry became quite disillusioned, doubting whether or not the Headmaster had even cared about him. Harry being led by a doe Patronus to the hiding place of the Sword of Gryffindor A couple nights later, while standing guard outside the tent, Harry was lead by a silver doe Patronus to a frozen pool into which someone had placed the Sword of Gryffindor, which leads Harry to strip to his underwear and jump in the pool. While trying to acquire the sword, the locket attempted to strangle him, but he was rescued by Ron, who had returned through the use of his Deluminator.  Ron destroying the locket Horcrux with the Sword of Gryffindor During the brief intense skirmish, the Horcrux created disturbing imagery, as a last line of defence. Ron was showed his deepest fears, such as spiders and telling him that he was the least loved by his mother who craved a daughter. The final taunt was creating apparitions of Harry and Hermione. The naked Harry and Hermione began to kiss passionately, enraging Ron, who then destroyed the Horcrux with the sword, casting the two away. As Ron had saved his life, Harry forgave him for leaving and after seeing the Horcrux torture Ron, explained that he had no feelings for Hermione beyond that of a sibling. Hermione, who had been inside the tent during the destruction of the Horcrux, was angry with Ron for a longer period.  The trio speaking with Xenophilius Lovegood at his home, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole On 30 December at Hermione's request, the three friends travelled to Luna Lovegood's home to question Xenophilius Lovegood. They asked about a triangular symbol Dumbledore had left them to decipher in the book he bequeathed to Hermione. After learning of the Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discovered that Xenophilius summoned Death Eaters in an attempt to persuade them to return his abducted daughter. The trio escaped the Death Eaters when Hermione blasted the floor open to show them Harry, but managed to keep Ron's alibi of being sick at home with spattergroit intact by covering him with the Invisibility Cloak.  Hermione arguing with a listless Harry over his obsession with the Deathly Hallows Harry soon became\nobsessed by the Deathly Hallows. He spent everyday brooding over the possibilities, forgetting about his responsibilities. With Harry's new found obsession with the Hallows, he became more and more withdrawn and listless. He came to believe that the Resurrection Stone was enclosed within the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore. He also surmised that Lord Voldemort was abroad in a search for the Elder Wand. This obsession troubled his friends, and with the drop in Harry's attentiveness Ron's leadership qualities flourished.  After listening to a broadcast of Potterwatch around Easter 1998, Harry determined that Voldemort was seeking the Elder Wand, and accidentally broke the Taboo on Voldemort's name. Captured by a gang of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback, the trio were questioned about who they were. Hermione had previously hit Harry in the face with a Stinging Hex in an attempt to conceal their true identities, but it all amounted to nothing as the Snatchers then found the Sword of Gryffindor. After Greyback and Scabior realised that they had caught Harry Potter, the trio were taken to Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. The Snatchers decided to forgo taking Harry to the Ministry, but instead to Voldemort directly.  Bellatrix Lestrange incapacitating Snatchers at Malfoy Manor When Bellatrix Lestrange learned that Harry had been caught, she immediately sought to summon Voldemort. She planned to do this, until she noticed one of the Snatchers had the Sword of Gryffindor, which was supposed to be in her vault at Gringotts.

He was the Captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team and played as a Chaser.  Roger was born between 1 September 1977 and 31 August 1978[1] in Great Britain or Ireland. He had an older brother named Chester Davies who was also in Ravenclaw.[4]  He began attending Hogwarts on 1 September 1989[1] and was sorted into Ravenclaw house. He joined the Ravenclaw Quidditch team as a Chaser and eventually became their Captain.[3]  Roger at the Yule Ball with Fleur In 1994, Roger was Fleur Delacour's date at the Yule Ball. He was very taken with the part-Veela witch's beauty and charm. He was so mesmerised, in fact, that he was looking at her the whole time and did not notice what she was actually saying, as well as repeatedly missing his own mouth with his fork while trying to eat. After dancing for some time at the ball, Roger and Fleur left for the gardens, sneaking into the rose bushes for a romantic engagement.[5]  Roger and Cho Chang sitting next to each other in the Great Hall According to Cho Chang, Roger asked her to go out with him shortly after the death of Cedric Diggory in June of 1995. She refused, as she was interested in Harry Potter at the time, though she brought this incident up to Harry when they went on a date in 1996 at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, apparently to make him jealous.[6]  Davies with a girl in Madam Puddifoot's teashop Roger was also there with his own date for Valentine's Day; Harry watched them for clues as to what to do with Cho, whom he thought was eyeing Roger as if she wished she were with him instead. When Cho left the teashop in a dramatic and tearful fashion, Roger, along with the rest of the customers in the teashop, looked at Harry, who was left behind.[6]  Fleur Delacour, his Yule Ball date who he was smitten with During 1994, Davies attended the Yule Ball as Fleur's partner. He was apparently too smitten by her part-Veela magic to actually take\nnote of anything she said, most of which was criticism of Hogwarts, while constantly missing his own mouth with the fork during dinner. The two apparently enjoyed their time together, as they had a romantic night within the bushes during the later parts of the Ball.[5] However, they did not keep in contact after the Triwizard Tournament ended, and Fleur later married Bill Weasley.[7]  Cho Chang, his ex-girlfriend Sometime after Cedric Diggory's death, Roger asked Cho out, to which she refused, being interested in Harry Potter at the time. Cho would later use this event to gauge Harry's feelings for her based on the jealousy he would produce, though he was only confused. Cho also watched Roger and his girlfriend holding hands and kissing over their sugar bowl in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, as though they were setting a standard that she expected Harry to live up to. Roger and his girlfriend stopped kissing to look at Harry in astonishment when Cho departed dramatically after an argument.[6]  Roger got himself a girlfriend sometime before 1996's Valentine's day, and the two seemed to be passionate with their relationship, as they were holding hands and kissing frequently over their sugar bowl inside Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop.[6]  Roger means \"famous spear\" from the Germanic elements hrod \"fame\" and ger \"spear\". The Normans brought this name to England, where it replaced the Old English cognate Hro\u00f0gar (the name of the Danish king in the Anglo-Saxon epic 'Beowulf'). It was a common name in England during the Middle Ages.\n\n\nAt least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\u00a0& Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells\u00a0& Harry Potter: Magic Awakened.As such, spoilers will be present within the article.

He and Arthur apparently clashed multiple times over this at the Ministry of Magic, where Arthur worked and Lucius visited regularly to see Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge.  When Arthur proposed the Muggle Protection Act in 1992, Lucius was furious to the\npoint of trying to sabotage Arthur by placing an old diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle\u2019s on Arthur\u2019s eleven-year-old daughter, Ginny, endangering her life as well as those of Muggle-born Hogwarts students, as this led to the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.[20] Also, Arthur never believed Lucius' claim that he had been under the Imperius Curse during the First Wizarding War, indicating that their enmity likely dates back to their younger years.   Order of the Phoenix, his allies Arthur had a good relationship with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Arthur was not an official member of the first order, but he became a member of the second order during the Second Wizarding War.  He seemed to know Sirius Black since the First Wizarding War. After the war, Sirius was imprisoned in Azkaban for betraying the Potters to Voldemort and killing twelve Muggles. In fact, Peter Pettigrew had committed the crimes and blamed Sirius. Arthur believed that when Sirius escaped from the prison, he wanted to kill Harry Potter. He told Harry not to try to find Sirius, as he knew that Harry would learn about Sirius's crimes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione learned the truth in 1994, and Pettigrew escaped again.   Arthur and Sirius became friendly in the second Order. They lived in the same house for a short time; Sirius also tried to comfort Arthur's children when Arthur was bitten by Nagini. Sirius was killed by his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Arthur's first reaction is unknown; he only tried not to talk about Sirius in front of Harry, knowing how that would make the boy feel. Arthur and Sirius were also distant relatives, through Arthur's mother.  Arthur appeared to be on good terms with Remus Lupin, too. Remus was a werewolf, but Arthur did not care about that; he thought Lupin was a good person. Furthermore, they had the same beliefs about blood purity, and they were both poor. Lupin was the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts for a short time when Ron, Ginny, Fred, George and Percy were attending the school. They all thought Remus was a good teacher. Arthur and Remus became members of the Order during the Second Wizarding War; they fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; during the final battle, Remus was killed. His body lay near Fred's, and the Weasley family looked very sad by both deaths.  Arthur seemed to like his daughter-in-law, Fleur Delacour. Unlike his wife and daughter, Arthur did not dislike her; after the war, Arthur had three grandchildren through Fleur.  Rubeus Hagrid was a member of the Order and very loyal to Dumbledore. He seemed to know the Weasleys since their earlier years, as they appeared to be friends in 1992. Hagrid told Arthur not to argue with Lucius Malfoy, believing that he was not worth it. Hagrid was also the Care of Magical Creatures professor of Ron and Ginny. The whole Weasley family\nappeared to be friendly with Hagrid. They were members of the Order who fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. They both survived the war.  Arthur had a high opinion of Alastor Moody, whom he had met at the Ministry of Magic. He thought Moody was a little mad but a very powerful and brave Auror, who had captured dozens of Death Eaters. They were friends, as well as members of the second Order. Arthur's children thought Moody was mad, too. Moody led the group of order members that fought at the Battle of the Seven Potters. Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort during the battle. Arthur was sad about his death.  Arthur also seemed to be on good terms with Severus Snape, despite the fact that Snape disliked his children. However, when he learned that Snape killed Dumbledore, he and his family obviously turned against him but that was most likely retracted when he learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, one of Arthur's grandchildren, Albus Potter, was named after Snape.   Arthur was also friendly with Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks was a young woman, as well as an Auror. Arthur and Tonks also knew each other through the Ministry of Magic. During the Battle of the Seven Potters, Tonks was responsible for Ron, they were paired together. Tonks managed to save herself and Ron from Bellatrix Lestrange, and then Arthur thanked Tonks. She was eventually murdered by Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts. Her dead body was put near Fred and Lupin's, and the Weasleys looked very sad by the deaths of all of them. It is unknown if he had met her son Teddy Lupin, but considering how Teddy was the godson of Arthur's son-in-law Harry, coupled with the fact that by 2017 Teddy was dating Arthur's granddaughter Victoire, it is possible that Teddy and Arthur were on good terms.  He appeared to be a friend of Kingsley Shacklebolt, as well. They were only members of the second Order. They fought together in many battles and survived the Second Wizarding War.  Many members of the Order were killed during battles in both wars; it is likely Arthur got on well with them.

Jacob's sibling investigated and discovered that Draco had taken his father's wand, as he was too young to have his own and wanted to perform magic after seeing Merula perform the Jelly-Legs Curse on Jacob's sibling. They successfully convinced Draco to tell them where the wand was, and returned it to Lucius.[42]  After discovering R's intention of clearing the British Ministry of Magic of corruption via mind control, Jacob's sibling met with the Circle of Khanna to discuss the moral ethics of such mechanisms. During this discussion, Tulip Karasu, who was leaning in favour of it being a situation where 'the ends justified the means', brought up Lucius Malfoy while noting how being rich and powerful gave a wizard a good chance of worming their way out of the Ministry's bad books,\ntelling Corey when they objected to this statement that her mother and father had never believed Lucius's claims of acting under the Imperius Curse, feeling Lucius had only escaped justice because he was of his family's status in the wizarding community.[43]  In 1992, during his son's return home from his first year at Hogwarts, Lucius was informed of Harry Potter's refusal of Draco's offer for friendship in favour of his allegiance to the Weasleys through their youngest Ron. Despite his disappointment that the wild hopes of the ex-Death Eaters \u2014 that Harry was another, and better, Voldemort \u2014 were completely unfounded,[30] he nevertheless discouraged Draco from seeming \"less than thrilled\" about the Potter boy, since open hostility towards him could prove potentially disadvantageous to their social standing, as Draco spent a lot of his time away from Hogwarts talking badly of Harry and him being placed on the Quidditch Team as a first year.[16]  Lucius's confrontation with Arthur Weasley in Flourish and Blotts Over the summer, Arthur Weasley began conducting raids on several wizarding households to confiscate Dark or illegally enchanted objects under his recently proposed Muggle Protection Act.[36] Before his home could be raided, Lucius sold several of his more incriminating possessions at Borgin and Burkes. The items sold included several dangerous cursed objects of unknown effects. He then set in motion the old task that Voldemort assigned him which involved reopening the Chamber of Secrets. Although his master fell before the plan came to fruition, Lucius still had Tom Riddle's Diary in his possession.   Therefore, he could still make excellent use of it by not only purging Hogwarts of Muggle-borns but also by sabotaging Weasley's reputation, eliminating an incriminating Dark artefact all at once and hopefully even exploiting the forthcoming chaos to have Dumbledore removed from his position at the school.[16] While in Flourish and Blotts Lucius got into a physical altercation with Arthur. Lucius then slipped the diary into Ginny's schoolbooks after meeting the Weasleys at Flourish and Blotts just before the start of the school term.[44]  Only the Malfoys' house-elf Dobby was aware of the diary's true nature, but Lucius did not believe his servant would interfere since house-elves were unable to disobey the commands of their masters. Unbeknownst to him, Dobby took this to his advantage by attempting to warn Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts.[45]  Early this school year, Lucius bought the whole Slytherin Quidditch team Nimbus 2001 broomsticks. The Nimbus 2001 was an highly advanced broom and the top of the line, therefore his gift was very expensive. He did this as bribe in order to get Draco instated as the team's Seeker.[46] He was present at the match where Harry was being chased by a rogue Bludger.[47]  Lucius sacking Dumbledore Students, animals, and ghosts were systematically petrified by the Basilisk that a possessed Ginny released as the diary's grip on her became gradually stronger. Lucius used the ensuing terror (as well as threats of cursing their families if they failed to cooperate) to influence the school's Board\nof Governors to discredit and vote to dismiss Albus Dumbledore as Headmaster for his poor governance of the school.[48] Harry followed to save Ginny and killed the Basilisk with Godric Gryffindor's sword. He then destroyed the diary with a Basilisk fang, which (though he did not know it was a Horcrux at the time) also destroyed the piece of Voldemort's soul inside.[49]  Harry with Dumbledore and Mr Malfoy after having defeated the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets Harry proved Ginny's innocence and pointed an accusing finger at the true culprit \u2014 Lucius. Lucius challenged the boy to prove his claims, but Dumbledore who had returned to Hogwarts at the request of the governors, stated that would be impossible with the diary beyond repair. However, he warned Lucius not to sell any more of Voldemort's school things, as Arthur Weasley would likely trace them back to him.   Subsequently (and adding insult to injury) Harry in gratitude to Dobby managed to trick Lucius into setting Dobby free. He accomplished this by wrapping the diary in his own sock before handing it back to Lucius. Dobby then caught the sock after Lucius carelessly tossed it aside; therefore, he was no longer forced into the servitude of the Malfoy family.[44]  Lucius being magically blasted back by Dobby for attempting to assault Harry In a fit of rage upon both losing his servant and being tricked by a much younger adversary, Lucius lost his normally controlled and calculating demeanour and tried to attack Harry. However, he was stopped by Dobby, who blasted him down a flight of steps. Lucius had no choice at that moment but to leave. While his role in the opening of the Chamber of Secrets could not be successfully proven, Lucius was ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor for threats against his eleven other colleagues.[44] Despite his sacking, he still maintained strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.  Ministry officials arriving to execute Buckbeak, a direct result of Lucius's pettiness During the 1993\u20131994 school year, Lucius's son Draco was attacked by the hippogriff named Buckbeak. Draco was attacked after he provoked the hippogriff during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson. Lucius took the case to the Ministry of Magic's Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. Once he was before the committee he insisted that the hippogriff be put to death.   Buckbeak's owner, gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, desperately tried to defend him. Hagrid had the assistance of Hermione Granger, arguing that Buckbeak had been provoked by Draco and had attacked in self-defence. Despite his actions, Malfoy still won the case and Buckbeak was sentenced to death. However, before Ministry executioner Walden Macnair could carry out the execution, Buckbeak was saved by Harry and Hermione (with the help of Hermione's Time-Turner), and subsequently came to be owned by Sirius Black.[50]  Lucius with his son at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup In 1994, Lucius attended the Quidditch World Cup with his family, sitting in the luxury box of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge.\nThough he was disgusted that Arthur Weasley was there in the Top Box with his children along with Harry and Hermione, Lucius and Arthur restrained themselves due to being in Fudge's presence.[51] In the aftermath of the cup, Malfoy and some other former Death Eaters were involved in the torture and humiliation of the Muggle site manager of the stadium and his family, though it was not known at that time to the public and officials. He fled when the Dark Mark was launched into the sky.[52][29]  Lucius in the Little Hangleton graveyard during the return of Lord Voldemort When Lord Voldemort rose again in the summer of 1995, Malfoy returned to him on his summons. He arrived in Little Hangleton Graveyard and claimed that he had done everything he could all along to find Voldemort. He also insisted that he did everything to help him rise again. Voldemort believed that Malfoy had not truly renounced his old ways, but mild", "PPL": 0.1836610734462738, "PPL/lower": 0.2947255278274223, "PPL/zlib": 5.051184638236353e-05, "Min-5%": 3.5481302390495935, "Min-10%": 1.8313803796327728, "Min-20%": 0.91764115646691, "Min-30%": 0.6119083464665168, "Min-40%": 0.459498655925282, "Min-50%": 0.36747245494605046, "Min-60%": 0.30614397683977457}, {"text": "demort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb and Harry turned in to see McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley blasted backwards in pain and Voldemort directing his wand at Molly. Harry then cast a Shield Charm to protect her from Voldemort's wrath, revealing himself for the final duel.  Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War Unbeknownst to Voldemort, mastery of the Elder Wand, which he had stolen from Dumbledore's grave, had not been taken from Dumbledore by Snape, but by Draco Malfoy, because Draco had disarmed Dumbledore on the night of his murder, before Snape killed him. Thus, when Harry had disarmed Malfoy in Malfoy Manor weeks earlier, he had become the true master of the Elder Wand.  When Harry and Voldemort faced off for the last time, Harry tried to tell him this and about the other mistakes he had made. Harry also asked him to feel some remorse for his actions, which Voldemort instantly rejected. Voldemort cast the Killing Curse, and Harry countered with the Disarming Charm. The Elder Wand refused to attack its master, and the Killing Curse rebounded, destroying Voldemort once and for all, as the most powerful wand in the world fell into the hands of its true master at last.  The battle-worn trio in the morning after the battle Immediately, Harry was surrounded by overjoyed fellow fighters; Hermione and Ron reached him first, and then Ginny, Neville, and Luna. Victory celebrations began and Harry was an indispensable part of the grief and celebration.   The trio visited Albus Dumbledore's portrait, and along the way he explained everything to his two best friends. Harry decided to prevent the Deathly Hallows from ever being reunited again by keeping the Cloak of Invisibility, leaving the Resurrection Stone where it lay in the Forbidden Forest, and returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave, but not before using it to fix his wand.  When Voldemort destroyed the piece of his soul residing in Harry, Harry lost the ability to speak Parseltongue.[94] It is possible, however,\nthat he regained the ability later.  Harry and Ginny Potter with their three children Harry ensured that Severus Snape's portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office at Hogwarts.[95] He also made occasional visits to the school to give lectures to the students on Defence Against the Dark Arts. At some point, the trio were featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments.  Harry was also on \"Christmas card\" terms with his cousin Dudley Dursley and his family, and occasionally visited him, which were occasions dreaded by his own children.[96] Harry also made peace with his former rival Draco Malfoy, something that his father and his friends were never able to do with Severus Snape. They were civil towards each other; however, their schoolboy enmity meant that they were still not friends at this stage.  Also following the war, he aided in the care of his godson, Teddy Lupin, thus fulfilling the role that his own godfather, Sirius Black, never got to play. Harry and Teddy eventually became very close. Harry's children commented that they wanted Teddy to move in with the family, Harry mentioned that Teddy had already been coming to their home for dinner four times a week, and that he was practically living with them as it was.[97] The Potters were also thrilled at the idea that Teddy, who was seen snogging Victoire Weasley (the eldest daughter of Bill and Fleur Weasley) might officially become a part of their family.  Harry Potter as a young Auror At the end of the Second Wizarding War, Harry was recruited by the new Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt and became an Auror at the British Ministry of Magic. Kingsley permitted those who had fought in the final battle to become Aurors without getting their N.E.W.T.s, as surviving such a battle satisfied the skill and character requirements.[98]  Along with his friend Ron Weasley, Harry was considered an expert and helped reform and revolutionise the Auror department and the rest of the Ministry, along with Hermione Granger, who became a high ranking official in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[52] In 2007, Harry became the Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26 or 27.[51]  Harry meeting the student at King's Cross On 1 September 2008,[99] Harry arrived at King's Cross Station and guided a Muggle-born student to the barrier that connected to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.[100] During the 2008\u20132009 school year, the same Muggle-born student and their friends went to the Hogwarts Library to look for clues about malfunctioning broomsticks. While doing so, they found information on Harry's Quidditch accomplishments, including him being the youngest house player in a century and that he had caught his first Golden Snitch with his mouth. They also found images of his first year Quidditch uniform, with Robyn Thistlethwaite being surprised by how small he was at the time, although she acknowledged that his light and speedy frame was perfect for a Seeker.[101]  In 2010, when third-year students went to Hogsmeade for the first time, Harry was also there\nwith Rubeus Hagrid, drinking Butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks Inn. When Harry choked on it, Hagrid patted him on the back.[102]  Harry and the student on the Quidditch pitch At some point later, Harry returned to Hogwarts to give a Defence Against the Dark Arts lecture at the request of Professor Minerva McGonagall. During this period of time Harry frequently gave lectures on the subject.[52] While at the castle, he met the same Muggle-born student he helped across the platform barrier. The two met in the Great Hall. They then went to the Quidditch pitch and the Viaduct Courtyard and talked about their memories.[102]  Harry after casting the Patronus Charm that ended the battle When Hogwarts was under attack by Dementors and other Dark creatures, Harry returned to the school and cast the final Patronus Charm that ended the battle. He also saw individuals by the forests wearing white masks, who he suspected may have been the culprits of the attacks. He then talked to the students and staff and, as an Auror, promised to look into the case properly.[103]  Harry was also invited by George Weasley to help sell his joke products, competing against George's brother Ron who preferred more conventional ones. George wrote Harry's identity of the \"Chosen One\" into the slogan he prepared for Harry. Though Ron was Harry's best friend, George pointed out that since Harry was the funder of their joke shop, he needed to think less about the \"best friends\" stuff. George convinced Harry that new products were likely to attract more customers.   Hermione and Harry meeting the student at Zonko's When they were doing a sale at Zonko's Joke Shop, Harry was chatting with Hermione, who was Ron's helper, when they met the same Muggle-born student and talked about these events. The student asked if this was purely them doing business, but Harry admitted he really was fed up with classical jokes, saying that anyone who had been bitten by a Nose-Biting Teacup dozens of times would not be tricked again, which he believed was the reason why Fred and George founded their shop so that they could invent new products, and succeeded in doing so, making their products very popular in the market. He then gave the student some tokens to buy some products and see for themselves.[104]  On Horace Slughorn's birthday, Harry went back to Hogwarts and gave him a cake that smelt like pineapple. They recalled Harry's mother Lily giving Slughorn Francis, and were possibly joined by the Muggle-born student.[105]  Harry and his children at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup Harry had married Ginny likely sometime before 2005, but certainly by 2014.[106][107] By 2017, the couple had three children of their own: two sons James Sirius and Albus Severus, and one daughter Lily Luna. Harry attended the final of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in early July in the Patagonian Desert.

While all students above fourth year scampered around trying to find dates, Ron and Harry found it hard to ask girls to the ball. Struck by the beauty and charm of Fleur Delacour, the Triwizard Champion from Beauxbatons Academy and a part-Veela witch, Ron asked her to attend the ball with him, but fled in embarrassment without waiting for an answer. He also offended Hermione by not asking her, and then by suggesting that she did not have a date and thus could accompany him.  Ron with his date at the Yule Ball Harry was eventually able to get them both dates with twins Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron's evening was a fiasco of the first sort. His \"traditional\" dress robes embarrassed him and his date, Padma Patil, and when Ron saw Hermione with Viktor Krum, he became intensely jealous. This led to a blazing argument between them during the end of the ball, with Ron making comments about Krum being too old for her and Hermione accusing him of ruining everything. Though their friendship did not suffer, it was clear that both had developed feelings for each other.[28]  During the Yule Ball, Ron had overheard Hagrid telling the Beaubaxtons Headmistress Olympe Maxime that he was half-giant. This information was also overheard by Daily Prophet Reporter Rita Skeeter, who wrote an article telling the wizarding world of Hagrid's heritage. This drove Hagrid to stop teaching for a time until Ron, Harry, and Hermione told him that they he was still their friend, no matter what.[28]  Harry retrieving a captive Ron during the second task On 24 February, Ron was put into an enchanted sleep and tied up at the bottom of the Black Lake, to be \"rescued\" by Harry as part of the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. When he found out that Harry had stayed behind to save Fleur's sister Gabrielle Delacour as well, Ron jokingly took him to task, but was impressed when Harry was given extra points for \"outstanding moral fibre\".  Fleur thanked Ron and Harry in turn for helping save Gabrielle, kissing both of them on the cheek. Ron gained much attention from the other students due to his being taken hostage for the task. He proceeded to exaggerate the events of what happened until Hermione called him on it.[28]  Early in the spring, Ron joined Harry and Hermione in visiting Sirius Black, who had taken to hiding in Hogsmeade. There, they discussed the disappearances of Ministry officials Barty Crouch Snr and Bertha Jorkins. In the weeks leading up to the final tournament task, Ron and Hermione helped\nHarry prepare by researching and trying out different jinxes and other helpful spells for the task. Ron and Hermione watched Harry together from the sidelines.[28]  Ron was present when the Minister for Magic visited Harry in the hospital wing They were shocked when Harry returned with Cedric Diggory's dead body. Ron was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by Professor Dumbledore, eagerly wanted to question Harry about Diggory, but he was told off by Molly Weasley who, along with his brother Bill Weasley, had come to watch Harry. Ron was furious with the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and calmed Molly when she was shocked by Black's appearance in the room. Ron did not go against Harry's story when he finally heard it, sticking by his best friend.[28]  Ron with others in 12 Grimmauld Place preparing to clean After Voldemort rose to power and the Second Wizarding War began, Dumbledore reformed the Order of the Phoenix. In the summer of 1995, the Order moved into their headquarters at 12 Grimmauld Place with the Weasley schoolchildren and Hermione Granger, where they helped Molly Weasley clean the old house and remained watchful for information about Harry. In August, Harry arrived at the headquarters after a Dementor attack on his cousin. Ron felt sorry that he had to keep Harry oblivious to the Order's plan and soon learnt that Harry's anger had been growing due to his isolation from his friends and his persecution by the media.[7]  Ron, Harry and Hermione stayed at Grimmauld Place throughout August. In late August, Ron and Hermione were made a Gryffindor prefect, for which Molly and Arthur gave Ron a new Cleansweep Eleven. Bound by their prefect duties, Ron and Hermione were separated from Harry on the Hogwarts Express and could only join Harry in his compartment for the last part of the journey. When they arrived, Ron expressed concern that Hagrid was not at the welcoming feast and was suspicious of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Dolores Umbridge.[7]  The first DADA class with Umbridge as the professor At school, Ron was one of the many students who expressed frustration with Professor Umbridge's refusal to teach the class practical defensive magic. He also won the position of Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team but was described by the team captain as \"needing improvement\". Ron's Quidditch practice caused him to fall behind in his schoolwork, to Hermione's chagrin. Soon, Ron's brother Percy Weasley sent him a letter advising him not to remain friends with Harry, whom he accused of being mad for supporting Dumbledore.[7] Ron was outraged by the letter's contents, tearing it into eight pieces and throwing it into the Gryffindor common room's fireplace, angrily declaring his brother to be \"the world's biggest git\".  Late in September, one evening when Harry returned from detention with Professor Umbridge, Ron, somewhat reluctantly, joined Hermione in convincing that Harry teach his fellow students defence against the dark arts. Harry initially disagreed,\nbut after a few days he decided to give it a go. Around this time, Professor Umbridge was appointed the first Hogwarts High Inquisitor, giving her the power to randomly create new school rules and inspect teachers' lessons.[7]  Ron during the meeting of students in the Hog's Head that would become known as Dumbledore's Army Late in October, students had their first visit to Hogsmeade. There, Harry, Ron, and Hermione met with several students who were interested in learning proper defence. Ron defended Harry against Zacharias Smith when questions rose, and was among the first to sign the recruitment parchment. On the way home from Hogsmeade, Ron became upset when he learned from Hermione that his sister Ginny was dating Ravenclaw student Michael Corner. The following morning, Ron awoke to find that suddenly, by order of Professor Umbridge, all student groups had been disbanded including the House Quidditch teams, but he was mollified when Harry said they would continue with their secret group, which Ginny named \"Dumbledore's Army\" during their first meeting, mocking the Ministry of Magic's fears of student uprisings.[7]  In the weeks following the first Dumbledore's Army meeting, Quidditch season arrived. Ron had nervous issues prior to the first match against Slytherin. They had made badges saying \"Weasley is our king\", which Harry decided could not mean anything good. In an attempt to distract Ron from the Slytherins, Hermione kissed him on the cheek for luck, effectively stunning Ron. Ron's play was abysmal, and it was not helped by the Slytherins' new song also entitled, \"Weasley is Our King\". Following the game Ron wanted to resign, but learned he could not, as Harry Potter, Fred, and George Weasley had been banned from Quidditch for life.  Hagrid telling Harry, Ron, and Hermione of his negotiations with the giants That evening Hagrid returned from his unknown disappearance. Although initially resistant he regaled the trio with his tales of the giants, though he refused to give them any hint about his gruesome injuries from Golgomath's tribe. Ultimately Hagrid's mission was a failure.[7]  Following Hagrid's return, he took up his post as Care of Magical Creatures professor. In Hagrid's first lesson, Ron learned about Thestrals, magical creatures that could only be seen by wizards and witches who had witnessed death.[7]  Harry informing the Weasleys of their father's attack at the Ministry Frequent Dumbledore's Army meetings, O.W.L. homework, and his prefect duties took up most of Ron's time as the holidays approached.

Burdened by the secret knowledge of Grindelwald's imminent rise to power and wanting to rectify past mistakes, it was natural, perhaps, that he felt drawn towards the job of Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, a position in which he could most easily prepare his charges for the dangers he knew one day would come.[35] Albus, who would henceforth come to be known to successive generations of students as 'Professor Dumbledore', was granted Classroom 3C on the third-floor and an office.[36] Around the same time, the bookish young educator also procured and read a copy of The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus.[37]  At some point early on in his teaching career, Albus became aware of the existence of an ancient magical artefact of unknown origin within the school; a looking-glass with a grim history that was far more revealing than most.[38] Having once been kept out in the open where hundreds of people could discover the apparent delights of the Mirror of Erised,[38] it had since been given a new home after a large number of them had become so entranced by what they had seen as to waste away before it. Some had reportedly even gone mad; not knowing if what it showed them was real or even possible.[38] He eventually found it, however, safely tucked away in a hidden room on the uppermost floor of the castle that would only reveal itself to someone if they were in great need of it.[39] The device, however, which upon closer examination turned out to have been bewitched with the tantalising power of showing those who stared into its surface a vision of their heart's deepest desire,[38] proved interesting rather than useful.[40] Intrigued by the mirror as a fascinating piece of magical ingenuity, Albus was nevertheless painfully aware that his greatest yearning at the time was for something impossible, and that clinging on to a wish that could never \u2013 and for obvious reasons ought never \u2013 to be fulfilled could only hurt him, Dumbledore eventually decided to leave the mirror where it was, covered by a curtain of black velvet. It would take many years before he went to visit it again.[35]  Even though the freshly hired instructor would henceforth largely busy himself with the training of young witches and wizards, Albus would continue to keep in touch with Nicolas Flamel, alongside whom he would eventually achieve a number of advancements in the field of alchemy over the years as their relationship blossomed from that of student-and-mentor, to that of an equal partnership and near life-long friendship.[8] At some point after this, Albus would visit his old friend and pose for a photograph in Flamel's workshop alongside his celebrated mentor, with many of his alchemical tools and equipment being visible in the background, as well as crystal ball and a book with a phoenix on the cover.[32]  Dumbledore teaching Newt Scamander, Leta Lestrange and other students the\nBoggart-Banishing Spell In the 1910s, Dumbledore taught Hufflepuff Newton Scamander and Slytherin Leta Lestrange. One of his lessons involved confronting a Boggart and learning the spell to banish it. When Newt's Boggart turned into a desk, Dumbledore commented on its unexpected nature and kindly inquired why it took this form: Newt confessed that his greatest fear was being stuck working in an office. After Newt successfully dispatched the Boggart, Dumbledore encouraged Leta to take her turn, reassuring her that being afraid of something wasn't shameful; everyone was afraid of something. The form of Leta's Boggart surprised both Dumbledore and the entire class: a white sheet containing an undistinguishable, slight form floating through a dark blue glow. The event badly shook Leta.[35]  In 1913, one of Leta's experiments with a Jarvey went too far endangering the life of another student. Newt decided to take the blame and was sentenced to expulsion. Dumbledore, however, argued strongly on his behalf. Whether Newt's expulsion was enforced or not is unknown, but Dumbledore succeeded in at least allowing Newt to keep his wand.[41]  During his time at Hogwarts, Dumbledore also developed close relationships and friendships with wizards and witches throughout the world. Among these friends, he counted the French alchemist Nicolas Flamel and Ilvermorny Charms Professor Eulalie Hicks. He maintained close contact with these friends in the form of enchanted books they all possessed which allowed them to speak despite the distance. The British Ministry of Magic, which was already suspicious of Dumbledore because of his past connection to Grindelwald, was wary of these relationships, believing that he used these contacts as spies to allow him to act as an independent authority to theirs, and maintained a close watch on Dumbledore and his allies. Chief among Dumbledore's rivals within the Ministry was Torquil Travers, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, who never tried to hide his dislike for the Hogwarts teacher.[35]  Throughout the early days of the global wizarding war, a series of devastating attacks was perpetrated by Gellert Grindelwald and his cadre of followers across Europe,[42] and rumours begun circulating that his former friend had procured a wand of immense power, which Albus, who was privy to the aspiring revolutionary's Quest for the Deathly Hallows, understood to mean that he had successfully obtained the Elder Wand.[43] Sometime afterwards, word reached Albus through his extensive contacts that Grindelwald had had another vision: He had seen a powerful Obscurus kill the man he feared above all else;[44] and even though the pact they had made all those years ago not to fight one another had ultimately worked in Grindelwald's favour by effectively preventing Albus from coming after him, it was clear that he still harboured fears that Dumbledore might still find a way to overcome it and move against him. Only too aware that he was quite possibly the only wizard alive capable of bringing a definitive end to Grindelwald's reign of terror, however, Dumbledore continued to monitor and to try to anticipate Grindelwald's activities in the hopes of intercepting the attempted\nrecruitment of the Obscurus.  It was only years later, around December of 1926 that Dumbledore's patient monitoring of Grindelwald's movements through second-hand accounts paid off; when he heard about the series of magical disturbances that were causing severe devastation throughout the city of New York that risked the exposure of the wizarding world. Having correctly guessed that the mysterious attacks to be the work of a powerful Obscurial and, forever mindful of the fact that if he could figure out where the prophesied entity was located, so could Grindelwald. Hence, Albus decided to arrange for his plans to be thwarted.[35] To this end, he contacted his old student, Newt Scamander, who had become a Magizoologist in the employment of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures at the Ministry of Magic in London and had been travelling throughout the world, locating and rescuing magical creatures from his fellow wizards; whether it was because they were greedy poachers seeking to profit off of them, or otherwise targeted them for the perceived threat they posed to the Statute of Secrecy.  Dumbledore told Newt of a Thunderbird that was being held captive in Egypt, knowing he would not stand for such an injustice and would not only rescue him but also return him to his native Arizona. To accomplish this, Newt would have to pass through the Muggle customs in New York; where his visit would co-concur with both the Obscurial attacks and Grindelwald's scheme to locate, identify and ally himself with the culprit. Trusting Newt to do the right thing and protect the Obscurial from Grindelwald, it turned out that his confidence in Newt's character and ability was well placed: Newt's involvement resulted not only in the discovery of Credence Barebone, the most powerful Obscurus ever recorded (the only one to survive into adulthood), but also in the capture of Grindelwald, who had been disguised as a high-ranking official at MACUSA by the name of Percival Graves to find the Obscurus. While there, however, Newt got in trouble when a number of the magical", "PPL": 0.10828901082277298, "PPL/lower": 0.23369023056416274, "PPL/zlib": 2.8229669140451768e-05, "Min-5%": 2.1415473636166724, "Min-10%": 1.079860028107742, "Min-20%": 0.5407330199050282, "Min-30%": 0.36069755978472395, "Min-40%": 0.27089033879252594, "Min-50%": 0.21665597563158387, "Min-60%": 0.1805033381416438}, {"text": "  Died 30 June 1997 (aged 115)Astronomy Tower, Hogwarts Castle, Highlands, Scotland, Great Britain[6][4]   Blood status Half-blood[7]   Marital status Single   Nationality English   Title(s) PrefectHead BoyProfessor[8]Head of Transfiguration (formerly)[9]Headmaster[8]Grand SorcererSupreme Mugwump (formerly)Chief Warlock     Signature     Physical information  Species Human[10]   Gender Male[10]   Height 5'11\"[5]   Weight 175 lbs (formerly; 1932)[11]168 lbs (1997)[5]   Hair colour Auburn (originally)[12][13]Silver[14]   Eye colour Blue[15]   Skin colour Fair[11]    Relationship information  Family members Percival Dumbledore (father) \u2020Kendra Dumbledore (mother) \u2020Aberforth Dumbledore (younger brother)Ariana Dumbledore (younger sister) \u2020Aurelius Dumbledore (biological nephew)[16]Honoria (aunt)Dumbledore family   Romances Gellert Grindelwald (former lover) \u2020    Magical characteristics  Boggart The corpse of his sister, Ariana[17]   Wand Unknown length, wood and core (formerly)15\", Elder, Thestral tail hair core[4][18]   Patronus Phoenix[19][20][21]    Affiliation  Occupation Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts (1910s)[22]Head of Transfiguration department (?-pre 1955)[9]Columnist for Transfiguration Today (1926\u2013?)[23]Headmaster of Hogwarts (pre 1971[24]\u20131997)Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (?\u20131995)   House Gryffindor[25]   Loyalty Dumbledore familyHogwarts School of Witchcraft and WizardryGryffindor[25]Transfiguration departmentGellert Grindelwald (formerly)[26]Order of MerlinDumbledore's first armyOrder of the PhoenixBritish Ministry of MagicCouncil of Magical LawWizengamotInternational Confederation of WizardsHarry PotterDumbledore's Army   [Source]   Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, O.M. (First Class), Grand Sorc., D. Wiz., X.J. (sorc.), S. of Mag.Q.[27] (August[2] 1881[4] \u2013 30 June 1997)[4] was an English half-blood wizard. He was the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, later the Transfiguration Professor, and later the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also served as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (?\u20131995) and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot (?\u20131995; 1996\u20131997). A Muggle-supporting wizard, though the absolute opposite in his earlier years, he was considered to have been the greatest wizard of modern times.  Albus Dumbledore was the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Albus was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death many years later, but, in turn, made him a better person.  While initially unable to directly act against Gellert Grindelwald due to their past blood pact, the Ministry's surveillance of him, his love for Grindelwald, and his lingering guilt over his sister's death, Dumbledore sent Newt Scamander to New York to release the Thunderbird Frank, and later sent Newt to Paris to rescue Credence Barebone. After the tragic death of Leta\nLestrange in Paris, Dumbledore became determined to contribute helpful advice to the resistance against Grindelwald, notably Newt, Theseus, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, and Nagini in the global wizarding war. Initially unbeknownst to Dumbledore, however, Grindelwald intended to use the former's alleged Obscurial relative, Aurelius Dumbledore, as a weapon against him.  Following the global wizarding war, regardless of Aurelius's fate, Dumbledore became most famous for defeating Grindelwald in what was considered to be the most epic duel of all time. He also gained much more recognition with his involvement in the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood and his work on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.  It was through Dumbledore that resistance to the rise of Lord Voldemort was formed. He founded and led the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. Following Voldemort's return and the start of the Second Wizarding War after the resignation of Cornelius Fudge, Dumbledore swiftly formed and led the second Order of the Phoenix. He would also support Jacob's sibling in the latter's quest for the Cursed Vaults, and consistently aid Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger during their first six years at Hogwarts, thus leading them to name Dumbledore's Army after him.  Due to the fact that he had a keen mind and legendary power, Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997, and considered by many as the greatest Hogwarts Headmaster. As he was about to die by a cursed ring, Dumbledore planned his own death with Severus Snape. Per the plan, Dumbledore was killed by Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.  Though he was no longer alive at the time, it was through Dumbledore's manipulations that Voldemort was ultimately defeated, and lasting peace finally restored to the wizarding world. Dumbledore was the only Headmaster who was laid to rest at Hogwarts. A portrait of him was later put in place in his office at Hogwarts. Harry Potter later named his second son, Albus Severus Potter, after him.  Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was born to Kendra and Percival Dumbledore in the summer[2] of 1881, in the mainly wizarding village of Mould-on-the-Wold.[5] The early years of Dumbledore's life were marked by tragedy when his younger sister, Ariana Dumbledore, was attacked by a group of Muggle boys, who saw her performing magic and were frightened by what they saw.  Ariana was left mentally and emotionally scarred by the event and her magical powers were left severely altered and would manifest themselves on rare occasions usually in random or destructive ways. Albus's father, Percival Dumbledore, was heartbroken and set out in search of his own brand of justice. He located the Muggle boys and attacked them, as they had his daughter. For this, Percival was sentenced to Azkaban where he later died, choosing the sentence over explaining why he had attacked the boys as it would have meant Ariana being taken away.  To escape the accusing eyes of the\nlocal community, Kendra Dumbledore moved her young family to the village of Godric's Hollow which, like Mould-on-the-Wold, was a part-wizarding village. Fearing - like her husband - that the ousting of her daughter's inability to control her magical ability would see her confined indefinitely to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Kendra rebuffed all her neighbours, with the eventual exception of Bathilda Bagshot, preferring to be left alone: and Albus learned not to mention his  sister or father in public.[28]  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Dumbledore began attending Hogwarts in the autumn of 1892 and was Sorted into Gryffindor house. Dumbledore's first year was met with much whispering about his father's crime. Many of Albus's fellow students mistakenly believed that, like father like son, Albus too hated Muggles. Some praised his father's actions, hoping to gain his trust, but", "PPL": 0.1840713918209076, "PPL/lower": 0.24354977142308695, "PPL/zlib": 5.777507590110094e-05, "Min-5%": 3.41369303242833, "Min-10%": 1.8223773215477372, "Min-20%": 0.9189376829278572, "Min-30%": 0.6131277315260566, "Min-40%": 0.4604739570543472, "Min-50%": 0.3682778228459746, "Min-60%": 0.3068233444338838}, {"text": "a Ford Anglia, and bewitched it to\nmake it fly; in order to do so, he made sure to include a loophole in a law he wrote for the Ministry: as long as he was not intending to fly the car, it would be legal. The car was part of Arthur's substantial personal collection of Muggle artefacts, which he kept in a shed and included plugs and batteries.[20]  At one point in either 1985 or 1986, Arthur walked in on his twin sons attempting to make an Unbreakable Vow with five-year old Ronald and, in Ron's own words, \"went mental\". Precisely what happened was never elaborated on, but it was the only time Arthur was ever seen to have been as angry as his wife and it left Fred feeling \"his left buttock has never been the same\" for years afterwards.   Arthur and Molly visited Hogwarts on at least two Christmases in the 1980s, when Charlie was attending Hogwarts. During these visits, Arthur met Jacob's sibling.[21][22]  Arthur greeting his family after returning from work In 1992, Ron, Fred, and George borrowed their father's car to rescue Harry Potter from Privet Drive, after not receiving letters from him all summer.  When Arthur returned to the Burrow after a night of Ministry raids, he was pleased to find out the car could indeed fly. That was until he caught his wife's eye; he then poorly reprimanded the boys for doing so. When asked if he had found anything during the raids, he responded that they had only found a bunch of shrinking door-keys and a biting kettle. He was also introduced to Harry Potter and asked him about rubber ducks, due to his fascination with muggles.[20]  Arthur's confrontation with Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts A few days later, the family, as well as Harry, went to Diagon Alley to purchase school supplies for the upcoming year. While there, they visited Flourish and Blotts, where Gilderoy Lockhart was having a book signing event, during which Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy over Arthur's support for Muggles. He was very excited to meet Hermione Granger's parents, both Muggle dentists, insisting on taking them out for a drink.[20]  When Harry and Ron were prevented from getting on Platform 9\u00be, the pair borrowed the Ford Anglia to fly to Hogwarts. As this was a serious potential breach of the Statute of Secrecy, Mr Weasley faced an inquiry at work over the incident.[20]  In the spring of 1993, Arthur and Molly were called to Hogwarts when it was learned the Monster of Slytherin had taken their daughter, Ginny, into the Chamber of Secrets. It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had planted an old school diary of Tom Riddle's on Ginny, which subsequently possessed her and forced her to open the Chamber. Ginny was nearly killed, but was saved by Harry Potter and her brother Ron.[20]  The Weasley family in Egypt Arthur won some money in a Daily Prophet drawing and he and his family travelled to Egypt to visit his son Bill. In\nautumn of the same year, when Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban and was believed to be seeking Harry's death, Arthur wanted to tell Harry the truth. He discussed the matter with his wife in secret, not wanting Harry to panic. Harry, however, overheard their conversation. On Platform 9\u00be, Arthur and Harry briefly discussed what Harry had heard; while pleased that Harry was not scared, Arthur urged Harry not to go seeking Black.[23]  Weasleys, Diggorys, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger in Dartmoor In the summer of 1994, Arthur managed to get himself and his family (as well as Harry and Hermione) tickets for the Quidditch World Cup from Ludo Bagman because Arthur had helped Otto, Ludo's brother, out of a minor scrape. Arthur was among the Weasleys who fetched Harry from the Dursleys via the Floo Network. While there, he expressed his fascination at various Muggle artefacts in the Dursley's house. The group sat in the Top Box, where they were confronted by the Malfoys, who were there by a personal invitation from the Minister himself, though both Arthur and Lucius were able to restrain themselves out of respect for Fudge.[16]  A little while after the Weasleys, along with Harry and Hermione, had returned to their tents, a group of masked Death Eaters began storming the camp-site, jinxing the camp-site manager's family and anything or anyone that got in their way. Arthur, along with Percy, Charlie, and Bill, went out to combat them. Before he left, he told Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione to seek refuge in the woods, and that he would find them when it was safe.[16]  Reappearance of the Dark Mark over the campsite of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Upon seeing the Dark Mark in the sky, Arthur, along with other Ministry officials, Apparated at once to the location from where the mark had been cast. Upon arrival, he and the other Ministry officials immediately sent out Stunning Spells towards the suspected perpetrators, before realising it was Harry, Ron, and Hermione standing in the clearing. He dismissed the possibility that Harry, Ron, or Hermione would have conjured it, even if they had known how to.   After looking in the bushes in the direction that their Stunners had gone, they found Crouch's house-elf, Winky, unconscious and on the ground next to her was Harry's wand, that he lost sometime during the Quidditch match. Despite the evidence that Harry's wand had, in fact, been the wand used to summon the Dark Mark, Arthur refused to believe that either Harry or Winky could have been the ones to do it, and that someone else must have been responsible.[16]  After the event, Arthur departed the campsite in the morning and returned to the Burrow with the others. Arthur was angered when he was shown a scathing article written by Rita Skeeter in the Daily Prophet, which harshly criticised the failure of Ministry officials to prevent the riot from happening, which even indirectly mentioned himself. Arthur and Percy then returned to the Ministry headquarters straight\naway to help straighten the mayhem befalling the Ministry.[16]  An Order meeting taking place at 12 Grimmauld Place In 1995, Arthur learned about the return of Lord Voldemort and joined the second Order of the Phoenix. He did this in preparation for the upcoming war. A week into the summer holiday Arthur got into an intense argument with his son Percy. Percy had recently been promoted to Junior Assistant to the Minister, working directly for Cornelius Fudge. Percy had hoped his family would be pleased, but Arthur suspected it was a move by the Ministry to put a spy in the staunchly Dumbledore-loyalist Weasley family.  Arthur and Molly welcoming Harry Percy proceeded to insult his father, claiming that ever since he started at the Ministry he had to struggle against Arthur's reputation. He stated that Arthur had no ambition, as why Arthur was still working in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office because he had no desire for advancement. This was in Percy's eyes, the reason behind the family's poor economic status. Percy continued by saying that Arthur was an idiot to align himself with Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, as he did not believe their statements that Lord Voldemort had returned.    Percy's own loyalty lay with the Ministry of Magic. Percy soon moved out and found a flat in central London and did not speak to his family for a long time. Arthur took the betrayal of his son very hard, to the extent that he would break whatever he happened to be holding whenever Percy's name was mentioned.[19]  Arthur escorting Harry to his disciplinary hearing When Harry broke the International Statute of Secrecy by defending himself and his cousin Dudley against two Dementors on 2 August, Arthur escorted him to his disciplinary hearing before the Wizengamot on the 12th. While he normally Apparated to work, Arthur felt arriving in a non-magical fashion would make a better impression, given for what Harry was being disciplined (underage magic). He was not allowed in with Harry while the trial was in session and waited for him outside the courtroom.[19]  Arthur being attacked by Nagini in the Hall of Prophecy One night, while guarding the Hall of Prophecy for the Order of the Phoenix, Arthur was attacked by Voldemort's s", "PPL": 0.2618721127510071, "PPL/lower": 0.37796608900931766, "PPL/zlib": 7.234036263839975e-05, "Min-5%": 4.987494652177773, "Min-10%": 2.6035002365927484, "Min-20%": 1.307803017493738, "Min-30%": 0.872413218747377, "Min-40%": 0.6551408028138419, "Min-50%": 0.523951570005007, "Min-60%": 0.43651161876509875}, {"text": "udger on his broom Harry defending himself against Grindylows in 1995 Harry teaching D.A. members how to disarm an opponent Harry duelling Voldemort in the Little Hangleton graveyard Harry defeating Draco Malfoy during their bathroom duel in 1997 Harry attempting the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange, using \"righteous anger\" Harry being one of only twelve students attending a N.E.W.T.-level Potions class Harry conjuring water with the Water-Making Spell Harry during a second-year Herbology lesson Harry using the Leg-Locker Curse nonverbally during his bathroom duel with Malfoy Harry and Buckbeak during the first lesson of Care of Magical Creatures Harry visiting the Restricted Section to search for information while investigating the Philosopher's Stone Harry, leader and teacher of Dumbledore's Army Harry using Side-Along Apparition to Apparate himself and Hermione  Harry was a wealthy wizard, having inherited the Potter family fortune after his parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort.

Because of his upbringing, he had few connections in his early years, the only people he truly interacted with being the abusive Dursleys. With his introduction to the wizarding world, this changed and he built connections with many of the residents of the magical community, both good and bad. His strongest relationships were with: his parents, his children, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Sirius Black, Hedwig, Dobby, Albus Dumbledore, Rubeus Hagrid, Minerva McGonagall, Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood and Teddy Lupin.  Harry is the Middle English form of the name Henry, derived from the Germanic name Heinrich, from the words heim, meaning \"home\", and ric, meaning \"power, ruler\". It has been a very popular name in the English-speaking world for centuries. Harry can also be a diminutive form of the name Harold, from the Old English name Hereweald, meaning \"leader of the army\". It has been the name of five kings of Norway, three kings of Denmark, and two kings of England.[190][191] In an interview J. K. Rowling stated that 'Harry' had always been one of her favourite boy's names and that if her daughter had been a son she would have named him 'Harry', although then she would have to have come up with a different name for the books as it \"would have been too cruel to name him after my own son\".[192] In-universe, it is possible that he was named after Henry Potter, nicknamed 'Harry', who was James' grandfather and Harry's great-grandfather.   The name \"James\" came into the English language from the French variation of the Late Latin name Iacomus, a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek \u1f38\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (Iak\u014dbos), from the Hebrew word \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 (Ya\u02bbaqov, hence the name Jacob), meaning \u201cholds the heel\u201d (in the Genesis narrative, Jacob was born grasping his twin brother Esau's heel and later bought his birthright). James is Harry's middle name, James was the name of his father and is also the name of his first son.  Potter is a very common surname of English origin.[193] It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname.[192][194]  Harry in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows chapter art by Mary GrandPr\u00e9 Harry in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition by Jim Kay Harry on Pottermore by Owen Davey Harry Potter as seen in Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells Harry Potter as a POP!

It was also he who alerted Petunia to the death of her sister and abandoned Harry Potter on her doorstep shortly after, ignoring her feelings on the matter. After Vernon Dursley tried to throw Harry out after the attack on Dudley Dursley, Dumbledore sent Petunia an exploding, screaming letter (howler).  Not even a year later Dumbledore arrived at 4 Privet Drive uninvited telling them that they had to let Harry stay until his 17th birthday for their protection, giving them drinks that constantly hit them in the head. However, when Dumbledore reprehended the Dursleys for their cruel treatment of Harry, Petunia, instead of reacting with anger like her husband, was thought by Harry to look faintly embarrassed. It is unknown to how Petunia reacted to his death or if Harry, Arthur Weasley or Kingsley Shacklebolt told her about his murder. Despite the kindness shown by Dumbledore to Petunia in his letter denying her a place at Hogwarts, she likely felt a sense of bitterness towards him for a number of years.  Petunia is the name of a flower. Her younger sister, Lily, also bears the name of a flower. This could have been done accidentally or by means of demonstrating Petunia's and Lily's sisterhood. A petunia is also a flower that is a symbol of resentment and anger. Petunia was a name J.K. Rowling used for unpleasant female characters in games in her youth, and believes the name may have subconsciously came from Joe and Petunia, a series of public information films she would have seen in her youth.[6]  Petunia flowers themselves are used to represent resentment, along with anger. The alternative meaning is wanting the comfort of another person,[28] which is\nlightly implied when she asks to attend Hogwarts with her sister. It should also be noted that the flower is known for not smelling particularly pleasant.[29]  Petunia's maiden name was Evans. Evans is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name Evan.[30] As a Welsh name, Evan means \"young warrior\". It can also be considered a form of the name John, meaning \"God is gracious\".[31]  Petunia's married surname is Dursley. Dursley is a town in Gloucestershire, England. J. K. Rowling has commented that she visited the place as a child and hated it, which likely affected her choice of surname for the awful family, remarking \"I don't imagine I'm very popular in Dursley\".[32][33] The town is known for its Victorian history in coal mining. Rowling chose the name because it sounded \"dull and forbidding\".

As well as a member of the Malfoy family. Lucius was educated at Hogwarts, where he was made a prefect in Slytherin House. As an adult, Lucius was an aristocratic wizard and patriarch of the Malfoy family, believing strongly in notions of blood purity and the superiority of pure-blood wizards. He joined the Death Eaters, who shared his views on blood purity, and participated in the First Wizarding War, becoming Voldemort's second-in-command. However, he was replaced by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Second Wizarding War.  After Lord Voldemort's first defeat, Lucius managed to avoid imprisonment by lying that he had been acting under the Imperius Curse. He and his family remained members of the social elite, though Lucius continued to demonstrate his prejudice. He attempted to sabotage Arthur Weasley's career by slipping Arthur's daughter an old school diary of Tom Riddle's, opening the Chamber of Secrets in 1992, and in 1994, he participated in the humiliation of a Muggle family after the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.\n When Voldemort returned, Lucius once again served him as a Death Eater, leading the efforts to obtain the prophecy Voldemort sought. In the battle that ensued, the prophecy was destroyed, and Lucius and his comrades were imprisoned in Azkaban in 1996. Although Voldemort broke them out of prison in 1997, he was displeased with Lucius for his failures and treated the Malfoys with much disdain and abuse. Lucius and his family finally rebelled against Voldemort's tyranny and defected before the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, with them all surviving the Second Wizarding War.  Because he and his family defected from the Death Eaters they were pardoned for their crimes after Voldemort's final defeat and did not serve a stint in Azkaban. He and Narcissa later had a grandson, Scorpius Malfoy, after Draco married Astoria Greengrass.

However, she didn't expose Lupin, presumably because she believed he was a good teacher and didn't agree with the prejudice many hold against werewolves.   Trelawney telling Hermione that she does not possess the Second Sight Divination, on the other hand, turned out to be a subject Hermione had no respect or interest in. She considered it a \"woolly subject\" and mocked it to Harry and Ron. She also considered it less interesting then the subject of Ancient Runes. She also believed that Divination was an imprecise branch of magic, an option she and Professor McGonagall shared.[33] She soon dropped the subject after Professor Sybill Trelawney told her that she did not posses the Second Sight.   Professor Lupin and Sirius Black with the trio, before forcing Pettigrew into human form On the day of Buckbeak's execution, the trio ventured down to console Hagrid. While in his cabin, Hermione discovered Scabbers, Ron's lost rat. Hagrid urged them to leave and they witnessed from a distance what they believed to be Buckbeak's execution. Before they could return to their dormitory, Scabbers bit Ron and fled. While chasing after the rat, they were attacked by a black dog, which pulled Ron by the leg into a tunnel beneath the Whomping Willow, which then attacked them. \nAfterward, Hermione and Harry hurried after them eventually arriving in the Shrieking Shack, where Sirius Black, whose Animagus form was the black dog, confronted them. They were soon joined by Professor Lupin who was acting strangely, and Hermione told Harry and Ron of her belief that he was a werewolf, which he then confirmed. It was revealed that Sirius had been framed for the betrayal of James and Lily Potter, and that the true traitor was Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding from the world as Ron's pet rat. Hermione also cast Expelliarmus on Snape when he discovered them, knocking him out, at which she was horrified.  Harry, Hermione, and Sirius being attacked by Dementors at the Black Lake Once it had been decided that Pettigrew would be turned over to the authorities rather than murdered, the motley group left the Shrieking Shack. When the full moon appeared, chaos ensued as Lupin transformed into a werewolf as, due to the chaotic turn of events, he hadn't taken the Wolfsbane potion that Professor Snape produced for him monthly in order for him to retain his humanity. In the chaos, Pettigrew attacked Ron and escaped, and Sirius had to transform into his dog form in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the werewolf. After Lupin was eventually distracted by a howl from the Forbidden Forest, Hermione and Harry rushed to Sirius' aid when they heard him moaning, but hundreds of Dementors descended on them, come to recapture Sirius who quickly fainted, and Harry told Hermione to think of something happy and attempt to cast a patronus as he was trying to himself, but she was unable to cast one.  As Harry conjured an incorporeal Patronus, Hermione passed out, leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone. Harry held them off for a while but was eventually overwhelmed. The Dementors were about to perform the Kiss on Harry, Hermione, and Sirius when a mysterious figure in the distance cast a very powerful Patronus Charm to repel the Dementors. Unable to see properly in the resulting blinding light, Harry thought he glimpsed his father just before he, too, lost consciousness.  Harry and Hermione using the Time-turner Harry and Hermione awoke in the Hospital Wing after being rescued by Severus Snape, who conjured stretchers for Hermione, Harry and Sirius. After realising that Sirius' soul was to be destroyed by the Dementor's Kiss and receiving vague, though instructive and useful, instructions from Dumbledore, Hermione used her Time-Turner to return herself and Harry to a time earlier in the evening. It was a very difficult task and Harry had to be constantly reminded by Hermione to stay concealed as being seen could cause irreparable damage to their timelines. Hermione agreed with Harry that it was difficult to watch their problems again, but she strictly said that they could do nothing about it, as bad things happened to wizards who tried to meddle with their past and future lives.  Harry and Hermione setting Sirius Black and Buckbeak free The two did, however, successfully use the\nopportunity to rescue Sirius and also Buckbeak, as it was hinted by Dumbledore that more than one innocent life could be spared that night.[33] Whilst waiting, she discussed their saviour with Harry, and when Harry realised that it was not his father he saw but himself having travelled back in time, she claimed that none but a powerful wizard could have conjured a Patronus to drive away that many Dementors. As evidenced by her assertion that time-travelling was extremely dangerous, Hermione took great personal risk to save Sirius and Buckbeak. At the end of the year Hermione returned her Time-Turner, claiming it caused too much trouble and that she would drop a few subjects instead, which was a very big surprise to everyone.  Ron, Harry, and Hermione after the riot of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Before her fourth year at Hogwarts, Hermione spent much of the summer holidays at the Burrow with Harry and Ron, sharing a room with Ginny Weasley. With the other Weasleys (excluding Molly Weasley), they attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in August. After the game, the communal campsite was set upon by Death Eaters. Hermione, Harry, and Ron fled into the woods and witnessed the casting of Morsmordre. Initially caught up in the chaos surrounding the effort to catch the caster, she took exception to the accusations levelled against Harry, and the many wizards' treatment of the house-elf Winky who had also been at the scene.  Once at Hogwarts, it was revealed to the students that former Auror Alastor Moody (who was, in fact, a polyjuiced Barty Crouch Jnr) was to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Lupin having left at the end of the previous year due to Snape outing his werewolf status. Moody was a hands-on professor who believed in a practical approach when it came to defence. One of his earliest lessons was on the Unforgivable Curses. Hermione and her fellow classmates witnessed the curse's effects on a spider.   The first \"meeting\" of the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare Hermione began a crusade for the liberation of house-elves by beginning the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or what she and the group called S.P.E.W, (or, as Ronald Weasley called it, \"spew\") having been appalled by Bartemius Crouch's abusive treatment of his house-elf Winky. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believed that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning.   Harry, Ron, and Neville only reluctantly joined S.P.E.W., mostly in order to prevent Hermione from nagging them about it. Hagrid as well as Fred and George Weasley refused to join on the grounds that it would upset the house-elves. Despite this, Fred did tell Hermione how to get into the Hogwarts kitchens. One morning she (along with Harry and Ron) visited the kitchens, where she spoke to Dobby and Winky. Dobby was pleased to see Harry and his friends and proceeded to tell them his struggles as a freed elf.  The trio\nvisiting the house-elves in the Hogwarts kitchen While the trio were within the kitchen it was revealed that Winky was so saddened by the lose of her previous job that she had taken to drinking Butterbeer, as a means to get drunk and numb her pain. Hermione considered Dobby to be a good example of a free elf and tried to comfort Winky about being sacked by Crouch. This did little good, however, as Winky soon became upset by Hermione's claims that house-elves deserved to have holidays and wages. Winky was not the only elf bothered by this, as the other elves stated that proper house-elves would never need such things and to want them is considered very shameful.

However, Dumbledore professed not to care, so long as the Ministry did not eliminate him from Chocolate Frog Cards. He confessed that he believed that Fudge's persecution of him was of his own free will and not due to the Imperius Curse, though this was small comfort.[62]  Before the beginning of the school year, Dumbledore was made Secret-Keeper of the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix and ensured that Harry Potter's friends did not divulge any information about the Order to him, as he did not want the Order to be compromised in anyway.[62]  Dumbledore attended Harry's trial at the Ministry, arriving three hours early at five a.m. by a handy mistake. He presented Arabella Figg for Harry's defence and offered to call Dobby to testify that Harry had not used a Hover Charm in 1992 and reminded Fudge that he himself had pardoned Harry's accidental inflation of Marjorie Dursley. He also commented on the unusual behaviour of the court holding a full criminal hearing for a simple case of underage magic. After the Wizengamot had ruled in Harry's favour, Dumbledore left without having so much as spoken to Harry or looked at him.[62]  When the time came to choose the Prefects from the fifth-years, Dumbledore considered Harry, but out of sympathy for the ordeals he had faced and the ones still to come, he chose to spare him the added responsibility and passed it on to Ron Weasley. This decision confused some people who had assumed Harry would naturally receive it and would have shown solidarity with the young wizard.[62]  Dolores Umbridge, the new DADA professor interrupting Dumbledore Dumbledore had come to fear the connection that existed between the Dark Lord and Harry, and purposely avoided him throughout the school year. When signs of this connection became increasingly obvious, Dumbledore had Severus Snape attempt to teach Harry the art of Occlumency, rather than himself, as he\nfeared that Voldemort may have been able to peer into his mind through his connection to Harry. The Ministry also began to interfere heavily at Hogwarts. They appointed Fudge's Senior Undersecretary (Dolores Umbridge) to the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.[62]  Umbridge started her reign at Hogwarts by rudely interrupting Dumbledore's Start-of-Term Feast. Things got progressively worse from there. Umbridge and Fudge slowly passed rules and regulations that syphoned the powers of the Headmaster, while increasing those of Umbridge herself. Until finally Umbridge was granted the new position of High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. In response to Umbridge and the Ministry's refusal to teach practical defensive magic, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley created a group of students that met secretly to learn defence against the Dark Arts. With Harry acting as the leader and teacher, this organisation was known as Dumbledore's Army, in order to frighten the Ministry.[62]  Dumbledore escaping the Ministry workers: Fudge, Umbridge, Dawlish and Shacklebolt When this illegal society was uncovered, Dumbledore willingly took the blame; pointing out that it was named \"Dumbledore's Army, not Potter's Army.\" While Fudge ordered his arrest, Dumbledore stated that he would not come quietly and easily overpowered his would-be captors with a single spell and went underground, working to aid the Order full-time. In Dumbledore's stead, Umbridge was named Headmistress of Hogwarts and took full advantage of her position and authority over students and staff alike.[62]  Unfortunately, as Dumbledore had feared, Voldemort finally acted to use the connection between himself and Harry Potter. Using Legilimency, Voldemort created a vision that indicated that his beloved godfather, Sirius Black, had been captured by Voldemort personally and was being tortured by him within the Department of Mysteries. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom all rushed to the Ministry in the hopes of saving Sirius. However, the six students were ambushed by a group of Death Eaters, who hoped to force Harry to recover the record of the prophecy made about him and the Dark Lord. Voldemort perceived that it was too dangerous to enter the heart of the Ministry of Magic himself. Fortunately, Severus Snape was able to alert the Order to this and several members arrived in the Ministry where they battled with the Death Eaters.[62]  Dumbledore duelling Voldemort Near the end of the battle, Dumbledore himself arrived and swiftly captured all the Death Eaters personally; except Bellatrix Lestrange, who murdered Sirius and evaded a spell cast at her by the revered wizard. After binding the Death Eaters with an Anti-Disapparition Jinx, Dumbledore went to the atrium of the Ministry where Lestrange had been joined by Voldemort himself, who attempted to kill Harry.[62]  Voldemort's curse, however, was prevented; Dumbledore quickly animated a golden statue to cover Harry and shield him from the curse. He animated the other statues from the Fountain of Magical Brethren to immobilise Bellatrix and alert Ministry officials. With Voldemort having arrived in the Ministry, Dumbledore took this chance to give undeniable evidence to Fudge that the Dark Lord truly\nhad returned and fought him both to protect Harry and hold him at bay. Dumbledore displayed his extraordinary magical capabilities as he calmly countered or dodged Voldemort's attacks and returned with his own assault that steadily forced Voldemort to go on the defensive, yet Dumbledore was not fighting to kill, a fact which surprised Voldemort. Soon enough, Dumbledore managed to trap the Dark Lord within an Orb of Water just after having been saved by Fawkes, who intercepted a killing curse Voldemort had shot at Dumbledore while the latter was countering the strike of a fiery serpent that Voldemort had conjured. Though Dumbledore had failed to capture or defeat Voldemort, the Dark Lord realised himself that he could not overpower his former teacher, and so abandoned his effort and disapparated.[62]  Dumbledore telling Harry the whole prophecy in its entirety Before Voldemort fled the Ministry however, he briefly possessed Harry, hoping that Dumbledore would sacrifice the teenager in an attempt to kill him. However, Dumbledore did not take the bait as he cared for Harry too much to do it. Fortunately, Dumbledore did not have to resort to whatever means he would've needed to remove Voldemort from Harry himself, as the tremendous power of Harry's love, dwelt on his grief for his late godfather, inflicted great pain upon Voldemort and the Dark Lord was forced to remove himself and block his connection. With his failure to retrieve the prophecy and his attempt on Harry's life foiled, Voldemort fled the Ministry with Bellatrix, but not before he was seen by Ministry officials, including Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. With Dumbledore's credibility realised once more, Fudge's was permanently lost. Henceforth, Dumbledore successfully ensured that Fudge removed Umbridge, pardoned Hagrid so he could return to Hogwarts and he himself would be reinstated as headmaster.[62]  Once he was back at Hogwarts, Dumbledore consulted with a distraught Harry. After all the stress and pain that was put on the fifteen-year-old's shoulders for an entire year, coupled with the loss of his godfather, Harry finally snapped and began destroying Dumbledore's possessions in an incredible rage. However Dumbledore calmly levelled with the boy, freely admitting that Harry had every right to be angry with him, and if anything he should have been far angrier at him.

Ron destroyed the locket Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, which had been left by an unknown assistant in a pool in the Forest, saving Harry's life and thus receiving forgiveness from Harry for leaving. Before he destroyed it, however, the locket revealed some of Ron's deepest fears, including that Hermione preferred Harry to him. Hermione, however, was unaware of this, as she had\nbeen in the tent while this occurred.  Upon seeing Ron, she screamed at Ron despite Harry trying to tell her that Ron just saved his life, and punched him until Harry cast a shield charm between them with Hermione's wand. She was furious with Ron for days for his abandonment, but gradually warmed up to him again.  The trio speaking with Xenophilius Lovegood at his home, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole The trio then travelled together to Xenophilius Lovegood's home to ask him about the strange symbol in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which Xenophilius had worn on a chain around his neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding. They had thought it to be the sign of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald after Krum recognised it at the wedding (Grindelwald being a former Durmstrang student), but Xenophilius informed them it was the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. Shortly after making this discovery, Harry realised that Luna wasn't at home, despite it being the Christmas holidays, and had been away for a long time. Xenophilius revealed to them that Luna had been taken prisoner by Death Eaters and that he planned to betray them in order to get her back.  Death Eaters ambushing the trio while they were inside the Lovegood home However, in attempting to capture them, Xenophilius made the Erumpent horn in his living room (which he had insisted was a Snorkack horn, much to Hermione's annoyance) explode, giving the trio the chance to hide just as Death Eaters Selwyn and Travers arrived. They threatened to kill Luna if they found that Xenophilius had lied about Harry Potter's presence in his home. In a remarkable show of mental and magical dexterity, Hermione concocted the trio's escape while safeguarding Ron's feigned illness and allowing the Death Eaters to glimpse Harry, so that they would not carry out their threat to kill Luna.[10]  In the spring of 1998, Harry accidentally triggered the Taboo jinx and Hermione, Harry, and Ron were tracked down and captured by a group of Snatchers, which included the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Greyback had developed cannibalistic tendencies when out of werewolf form and was eager to bite Hermione. After a brief and violent interrogation by the Snatchers, the captives were brought to Malfoy Manor and turned over to Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix immediately panicked at the sight of Godric Gryffindor's Sword and incapacitated the Snatchers with ease, as she was too quick for them. She then ordered them moved to the courtyard where she would deal with them later.  Bellatrix Lestrange torturing Hermione in Malfoy Manor Bellatrix gave away that what she believed to be the sword and another Horcrux were hidden in her vault at Gringotts in her panic. She proceeded to isolate Hermione and then brutally torture her with the Cruciatus Curse repeatedly along with taking a dagger and cutting the word Mudblood into her arm as interrogation methods. Ron (who had tried to take her place unsuccessfully) was reduced to sobs from hearing Hermione scream in pain. However, Hermione came\nup with a fake story that the sword was merely a copy of the real thing; a lie that Harry persuaded the imprisoned goblin Griphook to go along with.    Hermione was soon tortured into unconsciousness. With Hermione's moans and screams of pain echoing throughout the manor, Harry and Ron saw no possible hope left. Suddenly, Dobby came to the rescue of the prisoners in the dungeon, with audible crack as he apparated. Harry and Ron fought off Peter Pettigrew, who had been sent to investigate the noise. Harry snarled at him that Pettigrew owed him for Harry's sparing of his life with Lupin and Sirius, and the momentary relaxing of Pettigrew as a result caused him to be choked to death by his own silver hand (created by Voldemort) for showing Harry mercy.   Bellatrix holding her silver knife to Hermione's throat They raced upstairs and were forced to drop their wands when Bellatrix held a silver knife to Hermione's throat. Bellatrix cut through some skin, leaving a thin cut on the front of Hermione's neck. Right when Bellatrix was about to slit her throat, Dobby returned and sent the chandelier crashing to the floor, knocking Bellatrix over and enabling Harry to grab their wands from Draco and Disapparate with Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Dobby to Shell Cottage, where Bill and Fleur Weasley took up residence after their marriage. Unfortunately, Dobby was killed during this escape, by a knife Bellatrix threw.  The trio speaking with Griphook about what lay within the Lestrange vault Hermione, Harry, and Ron stayed at Shell Cottage for some time, whilst Fleur helped Hermione recover from her trauma. Ron didn't leave Hermione's bedside throughout this time. The trio formed a plan to break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts to retrieve the Horcrux Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, with the reluctant assistance of Griphook. The goblin only agreed to help them in exchange for Gryffindor's Sword; although lothe to lose it, Hermione was strongly against deceiving or double-crossing Griphook, who was startled by the care she and Harry had shown for house-elves,since most wizards do not think highly of non-human beings. The trio reluctantly agreed to Griphook's terms.  Ron and Hermione, disguised as Dragomir Despard and Bellatrix Lestrange Once more, Hermione used Polyjuice Potion, containing Bellatrix's hair. She was also forced to use Bellatrix's wand, as her wand had been confiscated by Snatchers. She very much disliked this, as the wand in question had caused so much suffering, such as contributing to Sirius' murder. She stated that the wand felt wrong and Harry speculated that it was because Hermione had not won the wand's intelligence.  It was determined that Hermione was \"too polite\" to really impersonate Bellatrix, as she did not treat those around her like scum. Despite this, the group managed to get into the vault, mainly because of Harry's use of the Imperius Curse. After many harrowing challenges, and Griphook betraying them out of a belief that they would not have kept to their agreement, Hermione, Ron, and Harry escaped on\nthe back of the half-blind dragon that was guarding the vault, with another Horcrux in their possession.[10]  Hermione and Ron destroying the cup in the Chamber of Secrets The trio finally returned to Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, with the assistance of Aberforth Dumbledore, after Harry had a vision that the remaining Horcrux they had not identified (but suspected was something formerly belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw) was hidden at the school. They were reunited with their friends in the reformed Dumbledore's Army, who declared their wish to fight the encroaching Death Eater army. Whilst Harry and Luna went to Ravenclaw Tower, Hermione and Ron retrieved Basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets in order to use them to destroy Horcruxes, and Hermione destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup.  Soon after reuniting with Harry, Ron expressed concern for the house-elves in the Hogwarts kitchens, prompting Hermione to kiss him for the very first time. Ron responded with great enthusiasm, but they quickly broke apart when Harry reminded them of their objective.

Upon seeing him, Harry attacked Black with Hermione and the seriously injured Ron helping in any way they could, but Harry could not bring himself to finish the job when he had Black in his power, and he was disarmed by Professor Lupin. Relieved at the sight of Lupin, Ron became worried when Lupin and Black greeted each other like brothers and demanded that Ron turn over his rat, Scabbers. Sirius and Lupin then told them about their own years spent at Hogwarts and how a wizard named Peter Pettigrew betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort then framed Sirius and transformed into a rat to go into hiding.  Still not fully convinced, Ron reluctantly handed over Scabbers when Lupin promised that if he was actually a rat, no harm would come to him. Scabbers was revealed to be Pettigrew, whom Sirius had recognised due to a missing toe. (Pettigrew has cut off one of his own fingers before transforming). A tearful Pettigrew confessed to the betrayal and begged for mercy from his former friends.[6]  Ron in the Hospital Wing with a broken leg, unable to walk When it was decided that Pettigrew should be turned over to the Dementors, Lupin splinted Ron's leg, and the assembled company left for Hogwarts. Along the way, the full moon broke out, and Lupin began to transform into a werewolf. In the skirmish, Pettigrew stole Lupin's wand, stunned Ron, and escaped into the moonlight. Hours later in the Hospital Wing, Ron was recovering both from his broken leg and Pettigrew's attack. Ron was unable to walk, so he did not join Harry and\nHermione on their rescue mission. Ron was told that Harry and Hermione had managed to save Sirius from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak from execution with Hermione's Time-Turner.[6]  Ron understood why Hermione did not immediately mention the Time-Turner. Ron was slightly dismayed but, now knew the reason for her strange behaviour and timetable earlier on, he was nevertheless relieved that Sirius and Buckbeak were both safe and free.  Ron offering Pig to Crookshanks to check on Hogwarts Express As a replacement for his lost pet, Sirius sent Ron a tiny owl. Ron, to the surprise of both Harry and Hermione, allowed Crookshanks to sniff the owl. Crookshanks gave his approval, thus confirming that it was in fact just an owl. Ginny immediately named Pigwidgeon because she thought the name was \"sweet\"; annoyed and disgusted at this, Ron tried to choose another name, but it was too late, so he settled for using the nickname \"Pig\".[6]  Ron at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with his friends and family In the summer of 1994, Ron invited Harry and Hermione to accompany the Weasleys to the Quidditch World Cup, which was being held in Britain for the first time in decades. While Hermione joined the Weasleys at The Burrow, Harry had to be picked up from the Dursleys. Arthur Weasley arranged to pick up Harry via Floo Network, not knowing that the Dursleys' fireplace was blocked, so when Ron, Arthur, Fred and George tried to fetch Harry they ended up stuck in the chimney. Part of the Dursleys' house was destroyed before Harry returned to the Weasley's house.[28]  The following day, Harry, Hermione, and all the Weasleys except Molly Weasley left for the Quidditch World Cup, where they set up camp and met many of their friends from Hogwarts or the Ministry. They had prime seats for the match, thanks to Mr Weasley, who had helped Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, out of a messy problem. During the match Ron watched Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker, play an excellent match and catch the Snitch. Even though Krum caught the Snitch the Irish National Quidditch Team still won the match.[28]  Ron, Harry, and Hermione after the riot at the Quidditch World Cup That night, while the Irish supporters were still awake celebrating their victory, trouble began. Some Death Eaters who had managed to avoid imprisonment in Azkaban, attacked the camp where Ron and his friends and family were staying. Mr Weasley ordered Ron, Harry, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny to get to safety, while he and the older Weasley children set off to help the Ministry of Magic. Fred and George were responsible for Ginny's safety, which left the trio to themselves.[28]  Running off into the woods, Ron, Hermione, and Harry quickly lost Fred, George and Ginny, but they did find Draco Malfoy. Malfoy meanly suggested that Hermione, being a Muggle-Born, could easily be targeted by the Death Eaters, causing Ron to insist that she and Harry join him in going deeper into the\nwoods. Soon they reached a patch of woods giving off a silver glow, where the trio found a few Veela witches surrounded by admirers. Ron was entranced and stated that he would create a broom that would fly to space. They had reached an empty clearing when they heard an unknown person cast the Dark Mark.[28]  The trio during a Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson on the Unforgivable Curses On 1 September, Ron and his friends departed for Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts Express. That evening at the Welcoming Feast, Dumbledore announced that Hogwarts would host the Triwizard Tournament. Ron found himself caught up in dreams of being a Triwizard Champion, but he was snapped back to reality by his fourth year classes. In Care of Magical Creatures, Hagrid had his students tending to Blast-Ended Skrewts, and in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Ron was impressed by the new professor, \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, when he taught the class about the three Unforgivable Curses.  It was announced that the students from the Durmstrang Institute and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic would be arriving at Hogwarts on 30 October. Ron was dumbstruck when he saw Viktor Krum among the Durmstrang students, not realising how young his hero was. He was disappointed when Krum sat among the Slytherin students.[28]  An angry Ron and an upset Hermione watching as Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire Having discussed the possibility of somehow outsmarting the Goblet of Fire and the Age Line that Dumbledore had cast around it, Ron was surprised to find that Harry's name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. Jealous of the fact that Harry always seemed to receive all the attention, Ron refused to accept that Harry didn't put his name in the cup. He even went as far as to accuse Harry of cheating his way into the tournament. After the argument, he and Harry stopped talking to each other, and Ron began hanging out with other Gryffindors like Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.[28]  Ron and others watching Harry participate in the first task When Ron heard Harry talking to someone one night, he went down to see who it was since Harry didn't tell him about such a thing. When Harry accused Ron of trying to spy on him and when he told him who he talked to was none of Ron's business, Ron was deeply offended to the point where he tried to get Harry to tell him whom he was talking to by accusing him of practising for an interview. This only made Harry throw one of Draco Malfoy's \"Potter Stinks\" badges at him and tell him he could wear that during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. This made Ron finally realise that the reason Harry had started avoiding him was because Harry felt betrayed by him to the point where he had lost Harry's trust and respect and Harry no longer saw him as a friend, a realisation that deeply hurt Ron.[28]  Ron and Harry did not talk to\neach other again until after the First Task. After seeing just how much danger was involved in the task, Ron realised Harry would never have put his own name into the Goblet of Fire, and the two became best friends once again.[28]  Ron wearing his more traditional dress robes Soon after the First Task, Professor McGonagall told Ron and the other Gryffindor boys about the traditional", "PPL": 0.28700995445251465, "PPL/lower": 0.30680130029168634, "PPL/zlib": 8.22849640058815e-05, "Min-5%": 5.246822057985792, "Min-10%": 2.834154413099967, "Min-20%": 1.432705936493457, "Min-30%": 0.9560738925580148, "Min-40%": 0.718030433767375, "Min-50%": 0.5742496455736963, "Min-60%": 0.47841532631847}, {"text": "she was a talented witch, regardless of what bigoted people said about her Muggle-born status.[4]  Harry and Ron were surprised, and Ron annoyed, by Hermione's obvious crush on Gilderoy Lockhart, who became that year's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. She scored full marks on the first quiz in his class, which consisted entirely of questions pertaining to Lockhart's books, including a question regarding his favourite colour (lilac) that most of the class had answered incorrectly. In fact,\nshe went as far as to doodle hearts on her DADA assignments, not knowing until later that he was, in reality, a self-obsessed fraud.[4]  The writing on the wall and the Petrified form of Mrs Norris On Hallowe'en 1992 Hermione attended Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party with Harry and Ron. Whilst heading back upstairs, she followed Harry in a detour, after he claimed to be hearing voices. They discovered the caretaker's cat, Mrs Norris, petrified and the walls vandalised. Hermione began spending all her free time in the Hogwarts Library after she saw the writing on the corridor walls, which had said that the Chamber of Secrets had been re-opened. Despite hoping to read about the legend, she could not, as all the books had been previously checked out.[4]  Hermione asking Professor Binns about the Chamber of Secrets Hermione shocked everyone when she actually interrupted Professor Binns during a History of Magic class, asking about the Chamber of Secrets. This was the only known time when a student had asked the boring professor a question, and the class was interested in what he had to say. Professor Binns had stated that Salazar Slytherin had hidden a chamber which consisted of a horrible monster. It had been unleashed before once by an \"Heir of Slytherin\", petrifying many Muggle-born and had also killed a Ravenclaw girl, named Myrtle Warren, who began haunting the girls' lavatory and became known as Moaning Myrtle. Slytherin, a pure-blood loyalist, was against Muggle-born children being allowed to attend Hogwarts, but he was outnumbered by the other founders and Muggle-borns like Hermione were permitted as students. Slytherin fled the school, but rumours spread that he had built a hidden chamber; it was said that the school had been searched many times, but no such chamber had been found.[4]  Hermione brewing Polyjuice Potion, used by the trio in an attempt to gain information from Draco Malfoy When Harry proposed the theory that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin, Hermione and Ron agreed. Hermione suggested that they brew Polyjuice Potion, and temporarily transform themselves into Slytherin students in an attempt to find out the truth. She went even further by daring to check Moste Potente Potions out of the library using a note from Professor Lockhart \u2014 who had no idea what the book was \u2014 in the desire to research the potion. The book was in the Restricted Section and therefore unavailable to younger students without permission from a teacher. She hoped that they would be able to obtain a viable confession from Malfoy, if he was unaware he was being interrogated. She brewed the potion in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, as no one used it due to Myrtle herself being highly irritating. She also risked serious consequences when she stole potion ingredients from Professor Snape's personal cupboards that were needed for the difficult potion, which took a month to brew.[4]  The trio discuss possible theories behind Tom Riddle's mysterious diary Unfortunately, Hermione was unable to join Harry and Ron in the ruse with Polyjuice Potion because\nthe hair she obtained from Slytherin Millicent Bulstrode during their scuffle in the Duelling Club was actually the hair of Bulstrode's cat. Hermione grew fur and a tail and remained in the Hospital Wing for weeks as she did not transform back when the normal duration of effectiveness \u2014 one hour \u2014 was up. Harry and Ron, however, were able to use the potion she brewed to transform into Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe, respectively. They entered the Slytherin common room, and through conversation with Draco Malfoy, realised that he was not the Heir of Slytherin, and was not involved in the opening of the Chamber after all.[4] Meanwhile, Hermione continued to complete her school work from her bed in the Hospital Wing while she recovered.[32]  A Petrified Hermione in the Hospital Wing Months after her recovery from the Polyjuice complication, Hermione suffered another accident. Drawing the connection between Harry hearing voices in the walls and him being a Parselmouth, she came to the conclusion that the creature attacking students must be a Basilisk, and rushed to the library to conduct further research. On her way back from the library, she warned the first person she saw, Penelope Clearwater, and advised her to look around corners with a mirror before going anywhere. It saved both their lives, because they were both petrified when they spotted the Basilisk's eyes through the mirror instead of dying immediately as they would have done if they'd looked straight into its eyes.[4]  Though she was petrified for the rest of the school year, Hermione was still able to assist Harry and Ron, for she had torn out the page on Basilisks and scribbled on it \"pipes\", referencing the manner in which the creature had moved around the school undetected. Harry and Ron found it clenched in her hand when they were finally allowed to visit her in the Hospital Wing. Using this note and other information they had gathered, Harry and Ron were able to successfully put an end to Lord Voldemort's plans to resurrect his body through his memory stored in an old school diary.[4]  A fully recovered Hermione Hermione was later cured with a Mandrake Restorative Draught created by Professor Sprout. Upon arriving at the Great Hall, she was immediately greeted by Nearly Headless Nick. After hugging Harry she exchanged an awkward greeting with Ron. Hermione was disappointed to learn that, as a special treat for the school, Professor Dumbledore cancelled the students' end of year exams, but she was intensely proud that her friends had solved the mystery.[4] That summer, Hermione went on holiday to France with her parents.[33]  Hermione adopting Crookshanks from the Magical Menagerie Just before she began the 1993-1994 school year, while visiting Diagon Alley with Harry and the Weasley family, Hermione met and adopted a ginger part-Kneazle cat named Crookshanks from the Magical Menagerie. However, her new bond with her cat caused friction with Ron and his pet rat Scabbers, as Crookshanks was always trying to catch the rat. Also at the beginning of this school\nyear, Hermione obtained a Time-Turner from Professor McGonagall so she could double up on classes, though this was kept secret from everyone, even Harry and Ron.  McGonagall confiscating Harry's Firebolt after Hermione reported it When Harry received a Firebolt for Christmas with no note, Hermione reported it to Professor McGonagall, thinking it was sent by Sirius Black, whom everyone believed to be a dangerous murderer who was after Harry. His broom was taken away to be inspected, which caused a temporary rift between the two friends. There was a further social strain for Hermione when Ron accused Crookshanks of eating Scabbers, who had disappeared.  Hermione poured herself into defending Buckbeak, the hippogriff on trial before the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures for attacking Draco Malfoy during a Care of Magical Creatures class. Once the trio reconciled, after Hagrid told Harry and Ron how disappointed he was when they selfishly put the Firebolt and Scabbers over their friendship with Hermione, they apologised. Their initial attempt to save Buckbeak failed, as Lucius Malfoy frightened the Committee into deciding that the creature would be executed. Hermione was extremely upset by this news and grew furious to the point of slapping Draco Malfoy when he dared to mock Hagrid for his tears and being upset over Buckbeak's fate.  That year, Hermione was among the students who found Remus Lupin to be the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they have ever had. She cleverly deduced that Professor Lupin was a werewolf, based on his Boggart taking the form of a full moon, the timing of his unexplained absences from class, and Professor Snape changing a lesson he took over to the subject of werewolves even though it wasn't", "PPL": 0.09605041146278381, "PPL/lower": 0.16162634897286143, "PPL/zlib": 2.6129056437101147e-05, "Min-5%": 1.9018326371762098, "Min-10%": 0.9578758798626379, "Min-20%": 0.4796164446598042, "Min-30%": 0.3199115854704863, "Min-40%": 0.2402647908574268, "Min-50%": 0.19216603977815772, "Min-60%": 0.16010130416634935}, {"text": "charm\nDescription: Shrinks the head of the target.

In 1993, Lucius's son, Draco, was injured by Hagrid's Hippogriff Buckbeak. Lucius was furious and complained to the Ministry of Magic. At Buckbeak's trial, Lucius was the witness for the prosecution. Hagrid desperately tried to defend Buckbeak but he lost due to Lucius's influence at the Ministry. Buckbeak was sentenced to death but was saved by Harry and Hermione, which possibly led Lucius to feel that the Hippogriff had made him and Draco look like fools.  Death Eaters, his former loyal comrades As a high ranking Death Eater, Lucius was occasionally given leadership over his fellows by Voldemort. When given commands, the other Death Eaters usually follow them without question or signs of resentment. Once Lucius and his family lost favour with Voldemort the other Death Eaters largely lost any respect they had towards Lucius, even loudly jeering at him when Voldemort mentioned their relation by marriage to werewolf Remus Lupin (through Lucius's niece Nymphadora Tonks).  Peter Pettigrew worked alongside Lucius in keeping prisoners in the Malfoy Manor. They also stood next to each other in the Death Eater circle following Voldemort's rebirth. Lucius and Peter's Hogwarts years would have overlapped. The relationship between the two is unknown beyond this, although Pettigrew was assigned to work in the dungeons in Malfoy Manor as a servant, meaning he possibly had a low opinion of him.  Barty Crouch Jnr was a highly loyal Death Eater who had a strong dislike towards Lucius for never attempting to search\nfor Voldemort after he disappeared. While disguised as Alastor Moody at Hogwarts, Barty enjoyed intimidating Lucius's son Draco.  Corban Yaxley seemed familiar with Lucius and his wealthy and extravagant lifestyle, though he expressed this in a snide manner.  Igor Karkaroff was a friend and comrade of Lucius's during the First Wizarding War. Lucius considered sending his son to Durmstrang due to Karkaroff's headmastership and the fact that Durmstrang doesn't allow muggle-born wizards and witches to attend.  Lucius appeared to be friendly with Crabbe and Nott, as their sons were familiar with each other prior to arriving at Hogwarts. Nott visited the Malfoy Manor on at least one occasion to discuss unknown things with Lucius. Despite this, Lucius didn't hesitate to leave an injured Nott behind during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, knowing that Voldemort would be much angrier at losing the prophecy.  Lucius shared at least some of his Hogwarts years with Avery, Mulciber, Evan Rosier, Wilkes, and Rodolphus Lestrange. He and Rodolphus were brother-in-laws through their marriages with Naricissa and Bellatrix respectively. Lucius also chose Mulciber as his partner during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.  Lucius was disdainful towards werewolf Fenrir Greyback when he brought Harry Potter and his friends to the Malfoy Manor. Greyback was likewise resentful of the Malfoy's cold reception and argued with Lucius over who would receive credit for capturing Harry.

After attacking three male Muggles who assaulted Ariana, he was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban. Percival died there sometime after 1891.[5][6] Many years later, his eldest son became the longest and most noted Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was considered by some as the greatest wizard of all time.  Percival was a wizard, born into the presumably either pure-blood or half-blood Dumbledore family.[1]  In his later life, he married a Muggle-born witch named Kendra with whom he had three children: Albus (who bore the same as his second name), Aberforth, and Ariana.[6]  At the age of six, Percival's daughter Ariana was assaulted by three Muggle boys. The incident left her permanently traumatised and unable to control her magic powers. Percival, in a fit of vengeful rage, attacked her assailants. This resulted in his arrest and conviction by the Ministry of Magic. He was sentenced to Azkaban, where he later died. Percival never admitted the reasons for his attack on the Muggles. This was largely due to his fear that if the Ministry found out about his daughter's del", "PPL": 0.17769525945186615, "PPL/lower": 0.18965116631171597, "PPL/zlib": 5.5529768578708174e-05, "Min-5%": 3.304948054107965, "Min-10%": 1.7635692090489994, "Min-20%": 0.8871373703514287, "Min-30%": 0.592669875225619, "Min-40%": 0.4443376691061488, "Min-50%": 0.3553554624118394, "Min-60%": 0.29629354431965904}, {"text": "afterwards from her injuries.  The trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences, but Luna, Ernie Macmillan, and Seamus Finnigan came to their assistance. Under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, the three made their way to the Shrieking Shack, where they witnessed Voldemort have Nagini kill Severus Snape, as he had (ultimately incorrectly) assumed that the Elder Wand's loyalty lay with Snape.  During the brief pause in fighting, when Voldemort issued an ultimatum to Harry, Hermione comforted Ginny Weasley over Fred's death. When Voldemort and his army approached with a supposedly dead Harry, Hermione screamed in horror and denial.  Hermione witnessing Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort The Battle of Hogwarts soon resumed, and Hermione fought Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Ginny and Luna, despite being hindered by using Bellatrix's own wand against her. When Bellatrix nearly killed Ginny, Molly Weasley took over the fight and killed Bellatrix. Hermione witnessed Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, and she and Ron reached him first, overjoyed. Hermione survived the battle relatively unscathed, only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from\nentering the Lestranges' Vault shortly before the battle.[10]  At some point, Hermione found her parents in Australia and restored their memories. In 1998, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to attain her N.E.W.T.s.[36] She was the only one of the trio to do this, as Harry and Ron opted to join the Auror department and help round up remaining Death Eaters. By returning to Hogwarts she demonstrated how important schooling was to her.  At some point between 2010 and 2011, Hermione travelled to Diagon Alley, where she accidentally bumped into a Hogwarts student, causing both of them to drop their belongings. After the two apologised to each other, Hermione noticed that the spine on one of the student's books was broken, watching as they used the Mending Charm to fix it. Hermione asked if the student was enjoying their time at Hogwarts, which the student confirmed, although they admitted feeling somewhat overwhelmed on account of being Muggle-born. Hermione, herself a Muggle-born witch, reassured the student that they didn't have to learn everything in their first year, before asking them what their favourite class was.   Upon hearing their answer, she explained that Study of Ancient Runes was one of her favourite classes, to which the student, who hadn't previously recognised Hermione, revealed that they had just purchased a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard newly translated from Ancient Runes by Hermione Granger, noting that the picture of the author looked just like her. Hermione explained that she was indeed the author of the book and thanked them for buying a copy, asking them to send her an owl when they had finished in order to hear their thoughts on it. Hermione then wished the student luck in their studies, asking them to say hello to Neville Longbottom and Rubeus Hagrid for her as well.[32]  Hermione encountering the student at Hogwarts On 19 September, her birthday of a certain year, Hermione went back to Hogwarts in reminiscence. While at Hogwarts she visited the Library, as it was one of her favorite locations within the school. During her school days she spent extensive amounts of time within its walls. While in the library she encountered the same student. She noticed the book they were holding and told her story that involved it.[37]  Hermione with others at the end of the battle Hermione also came to Hogwarts's aid when the school fell under attack by Dementors and other Dark creatures, and joined the big battle at the end. When it was over, she discussed the possible cause of the attacks with Harry, Ron and the Hogwarts staff, noting that the other creatures couldn't have been swayed by the Dementors to join the attacks, since they were not easily affected by them as humans would be.[38]  Hermione and Harry meeting the student at Zonko's When Ron Weasley asked Hermione to help him sell joke products and compete against his brother George, who had already invited Harry, she couldn't say no, and so she came to Zonko's Joke Shop when\nthey were having a sale there, though she didn't really care for pranks and found that she was not good at promoting the products with passion. She was having a conversation with Harry in the shop when they met the Muggle-born student, who was surprised to see Hermione was the important guest that Ron claimed to have invited, seeing as she didn't seem to be the kind of person that was interested in joke products. Hermione agreed and talked about her feelings with them, and gave them some tokens to buy products with to save herself from doing her promotion speech.[39]  Hermione with her husband and two children By 2017, Hermione and Ron were married with two children: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. She had several nieces and nephews through her marriage to Ron. Hermione was also the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest child, James Sirius.[40]  Newspaper report on the trio joining the Ministry Hermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic, first through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. There, she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of underprivileged non-humans such as house-elves. She then went on to become Deputy Head[12] of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and assisted the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of pure-bloods. Along with Harry and Ron, she helped to revolutionise the Ministry and reform the wizarding world. At some point, Hermione, Harry, and Ron were all featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments.[41]  Hermione also eventually translated The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the original, which had been written in runes and which Albus Dumbledore bequeathed to her in his will in 1997. Her new translation was published in 2008 and included notes on each tale written by Dumbledore before his death; these notes were lent to Hermione by her former professor, Hogwarts Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.[42]  Both Hermione and Ron attended the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and sat in VIP Box Two. Rita Skeeter noted that Ron had become catatonic at the appearance of the Bulgarian Veela and Hermione had to elbow him in the ribs.  On 1 September 2017, Hermione and Ron brought their children to King's Cross Station to see Rose off for her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and met Harry, Ginny, and their three children there.  At some point between 2019 and 2020, Hermione was elected as Minister for Magic.[43] In the summer of 2020, Hermione had to visit Harry to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do. She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when Voldemort was alive. Harry reminded her that he did just find a Time-Turner and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own time. They agreed that the Time-Turner should be destroyed and Hermione hid it away.  A few months later, Hermione was returning to\nher office when she was stopped by Ron, who was really Albus Potter transfigured to look like Ron. Albus was trying to stall her while Scorpius Malfoy and Delphi stole the Time-Turner. Hermione found Ron annoying although he stalled her long enough for the others to find the Time-Turner and they left.  Hermione had found out about Harry's nightmares and how his scar was hurting again and she called a meeting. However, no one thought it was a threat.  Hermione and Ron standing in her office at the Ministry of Magic Hermione's life was changed by Albus and Scorpius when they meddled with time. In one alternate reality, she did not marry Ron and became the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. In another alternate reality where Harry died, Hermione was in hiding as a member of what remained of Dumbledore's Army with Ron and Severus Snape. When Scorpius turned up with information about the original timeline where they won, Hermione agreed to", "PPL": 0.15903878211975098, "PPL/lower": 0.2721447539503515, "PPL/zlib": 4.431283982160796e-05, "Min-5%": 3.1017736983942052, "Min-10%": 1.5845617203991496, "Min-20%": 0.7944002677031854, "Min-30%": 0.5298302718320655, "Min-40%": 0.39787324719386596, "Min-50%": 0.31819788486721134, "Min-60%": 0.26509774244645895}, {"text": "Sirius was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, much to the dismay of his friends and loved ones. Hermione was devastated by his death, and often tried to provide comfort to Harry, who had been even more deeply affected by the tragedy. At the end of the Second Wizarding War, Hermione became godmother to Harry's eldest son, James Sirius, whose first and middle name was derived from James Potter and Sirius Black respectively.  Hermione with Crookshanks Crookshanks was Hermione's large, bandy-legged, half-Kneazle, ginger-coloured pet cat since she bought him from the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley, in 1993. She seemed to think he was gorgeous, although no one else had wanted to buy him when he was still being sold at the Menagerie. She was proud of his cleverness. The latter proved to be quite true during the 1993\u20131994 school year.[33]  Crookshanks recognised that Hermione had left him at the Burrow before Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997,[10] most likely had been left in care of Mrs Weasley or Ginny, but it is possible that they were reunited after the Second War given the deep care and affection they had for each other.  Lavender Brown, her roommate and romantic rival Hermione's roommates at Hogwarts were fellow Gryffindors Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as Fay Dunbar and another girl. While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends, Hermione was not very close to either of them. Although the girls did not dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result.   For example, Hermione scorned Divination, Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject, and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit.[33] Hermione was also angry with Lavender for doubting Harry Potter's assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995 and snapped at her about it.   Parvati Patil, her roommate When Lavender began dating Ron Weasley, she was very upset and confided in Harry about her feelings. Once they broke up however, Hermione chose to not display open affection towards Ron so Lavender's feelings would not get hurt. She also came to Lavender's rescue during the Battle of Hogwarts, blasting Fenrir Greyback away from her.[10] Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the time Hermione reached her. It can\nbe assumed that Hermione was at least saddened by Lavenders death.  Hermione had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati, although the two were not close. During Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, she hugged Parvati after Harry caught the Snitch at a Quidditch game. Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in Transfiguration, and the two discussed Hermione's attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen. As Parvati looked \u201cpositively agog\u201d at Hermione confiding in her,[35] it can be assumed that Hermione seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates.  Cormac McLaggen Cormac McLaggen was a Gryffindor student one year above Hermione. The two became acquainted in 1996 through the Slug Club, of which they were both members, though Hermione did not think highly of McLaggen. When she overheard him insulting Ron and Ginny during Quidditch try-outs, Hermione struck him with the Confundus Charm, undermining his abilities as a Keeper.   Later in the year, when Hermione was furious with Ron for dating Lavender Brown, she decided to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with McLaggen because she knew Ron despised him. McLaggen was apparently interested in Hermione, as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there. This, as well as his tendency to boast about himself, put Hermione off, and she soon abandoned him for the company of Harry and Luna before leaving the party altogether to avoid him.[35] It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction.  Cho Chang in her fifth year Hermione had a two sided history with Cho; while Hermione offered Harry advice for making his relationship with Cho successful, Cho thought that Hermione's friendship with Harry was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Harry spends so much time with her. Hermione has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Harry told Hermione that Cho insulted her, instead rather cross at Harry for messing up his own relationship. When Harry arrives at the Room of Requirement with Ron and Hermione, shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted Hermione in a friendly way, probably since Cho had long broke up with Harry. The two seemed to be on neutral terms.  Lord Voldemort, her enemy Hermione first learned about Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time, after reading about him sometime before she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During her first year, she and Ron Weasley helped Harry Potter reach the Philosopher's Stone and protect it from Voldemort.   A year later, Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have \"magical powers\", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally \"caught\" the \"Heir of Slytherin\" when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also\ncorrectly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, the attempted to use the spell Aparecium, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an \"interested\" Hermione. When Ron compared Riddle to Percy \"in disgust\", mentioning the former as being \"Prefect, Head Boy... probably at the top of every class\", Hermione responded in a \"slightly hurt\" voice, \"You say that like it's a bad thing.\"    Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had \"caught the wrong person\", and that \"it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people\". Later on, after Harry mentioned \"hearing the voice\" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a Basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified  by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory.   In 1995, she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Harry against the Ministry's denial and smear campaign. She also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to prevent Voldemort from obtaining a vital prophecy, but was severely injured and rendered unconscious. In 1997, she left Hogwarts to help Harry and Ron find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. She personally destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup using a Basilisk's fang. She later witnessed Harry's defeat of Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.  However, Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort, truly seeing him for the first time during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin's Locket whilst travelling with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1997. The Horcrux locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of time, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry's likenesses in emotionally torturing", "PPL": 0.13980473577976227, "PPL/lower": 0.27712330596010215, "PPL/zlib": 3.934836357437722e-05, "Min-5%": 2.7602465029294585, "Min-10%": 1.3956719323782725, "Min-20%": 0.698600676398574, "Min-30%": 0.46580434926040015, "Min-40%": 0.34976607323804937, "Min-50%": 0.27971832074822045, "Min-60%": 0.2330377718930861}, {"text": "the Platform, catching his first sight of the Hogwarts Express. As most of the compartments were full, Harry pushed his things to near the end of the train, and with some help from twins from the red-headed family, was able to get his things aboard.[82]  While helping, the twins noticed his scar and recognised that he must be Harry Potter. While Harry sat near the window in his compartment watching the family, the twins Fred and George Weasley reported this discovery to the amazement of their little sister Ginny and their older brother Percy who was a Prefect and had already changed into his robes. After boarding, the train soon departed and Ron asked if he could sit with Harry, who agreed. Ron asked Harry about his scar, and Harry asked if Ron's whole family were wizards, which they are except for his mother's second cousin, who was an accountant. When the trolley witch came by around half-past twelve, Harry bought some of all the treats from the cart and shared them with Ron.  The trio meeting for the first time aboard the Hogwarts Express Neville Longbottom soon came by searching for his lost toad, Trevor. While Ron was attempting a magic spell to change his rat Scabbers, Hermione Granger interrupted trying to help find Trevor. After Ron's spell failed, Hermione introduced herself and upon learning Harry's name, informed him that he was in several books on magical history. While speculating which house they might be in, Harry and Ron were interrupted by Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. Although Draco attempted to ingratiate\nhimself, Harry refused to shake his hand after he insulted Ron and his family. When Goyle attempted to take some of their Chocolate Frog Cards, Scabbers bit his finger and helped drive them off. Ron afterwards explained that the Malfoy family were on Voldemort's side, but came back saying they had been bewitched, although his father did not believe it.[82]  Upon arriving, Hagrid gathered all the first years together and they followed a path down to the edge of a Great Lake. In groups of no more than four, they climbed aboard a little fleet of small boats, and sailed across the lake to an underground harbour. Helping to remind Neville to take his toad, Hagrid took them up a passageway to the gates of the castle.[82]  The new students were greeted at the castle door by Professor Minerva McGonagall, who explained the four houses of Hogwarts: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, as well as the rules of the House Cup. McGonagall led the first years into a small room off the Entrance Hall and told them to wait until she returned. When she did, they were led into the Great Hall, where they were greeted by the rest of the students, and more importantly, a shabby wizard's hat on a small stool.  Harry during the Sorting Ceremony Harry was particularly anxious, as he did not feel that any of the Houses as they were described in the Hat's song were right for him. Harry noted that Draco Malfoy, whom Harry had met in Diagon Alley, was instantly placed in Slytherin, and remembered what Hagrid and Ron had told him about Slytherin's reputation for turning out Dark wizards, and that Voldemort had been in Slytherin. When Harry put on the Hat, it slipped down past his eyes, and the hat told him that he \"would do well in Slytherin\". Thinking of Voldemort, Harry desperately repeated the phrase \"not Slytherin\". The Hat heeded Harry's request and placed Harry in Gryffindor along with Ron and Hermione Granger. In his second year during a visit to Dumbledore's office, the Sorting Hat re-emphasised the idea that Harry \"would do well in Slytherin\".  The Sorting Ceremony was followed by the Start-of-Term Feast. Having previously never been allowed to eat as much as he wanted, Harry was overwhelmed by the sheer variety of foods in front of him. Dessert arrived, and talk turned to the first-years' families. Neville Longbottom told the others how his family thought he was a Squib until his great-uncle accidentally dropped him out of a window, and he bounced.  Harry as his scar began to hurt during the Sorting Ceremony after making eye contact with Severus Snape It was during the feast that Harry's scar hurt for the first time: Harry was looking up at the staff table at Professor Quirrell when the hook-nosed teacher Quirrell was talking to looked past Quirrell at Harry, who immediately felt a sharp pain in his scar. This was because Lord Voldemort was inhabiting Quirrell's body as anytime Voldemort was near Harry's scar\nhurt. After the last morsels melted from the golden plates and goblets, Dumbledore gave a speech welcoming the new students to the school and the old students back. He added a few warnings about staying away from the Forbidden Forest, and avoiding the third-floor corridor before leading the school in singing the school song and sending everyone off to their dormitories.  In his first ever Potions class, Harry discovered that Professor Snape hated him, mocking him as the school's \"new celebrity\" before teaching the class how to brew a Boil-Cure Potion. Harry and Ron went down to Hagrid's hut for tea, where they met Hagrid's huge and fierce-looking dog, Fang. Hagrid told Harry that he was overreacting to Snape's treatment, asserting that he would have no reason to hate him. Hagrid and Ron began to talk about Ron's older brother Charlie Weasley. While they were talking, Harry picked up a cutting from the Daily Prophet that was lying on the table. The article detailed a break-in that occurred on Harry's birthday at Gringotts. The vault that was broken into was number 713, the same vault Hagrid visited with Harry on their trip to Diagon Alley.  The first flying class of the 1991\u20131992 school year One of the things that Harry had been looking forward to was learning to fly until he found out that the Gryffindors would be taking flying lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy had been bragging about his skill to anyone who would listen. Madam Rolanda Hooch taught the class by starting with basic broom control. After learning the theory, the students were told to hover gently off the ground on Madam Hooch's go-ahead. Terrified of being left behind, Neville panicked and kicked off before anyone else, rising fifty feet in the air before falling off and breaking his wrist. Madam Hooch took Neville to the Hospital Wing after warning the other students to stay on the ground until she got back.  Draco Malfoy nicked Neville's Remembrall from off the ground and was told to give it to Harry, jeering that he would leave it \"up a tree\" unless Harry stopped him and took off on his broom. Harry mounted his broom and kicked off after him. As much to his surprise as everyone else's, he discovered that he could not only fly, but that it was something he did not need to be taught. Bending low on the broom handle, he shot toward Draco, who realised that Harry was a better flyer and threw the Remembrall into the air, daring the famous boy to catch it. Harry raced the ball towards the ground, catching it and coming out of his dive a foot from the ground. He toppled lightly onto the grass amidst the cheers of the Gryffindors, grinning wildly.  McGonagall discovering Harry's potential as the new Gryffindor Seeker His euphoria did not last long, however, as Professor McGonagall quickly arrived on the scene. Having seen the dive, she ordered Harry to follow her. Expecting punishment, Harry was instead introduced to Oliver Wood, whom she\npulled out of a Charms class. Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Wood's confusion at being introduced to a first year quickly turned to excitement and ecstasy upon hearing McGonagall recount the dive. He told her that Harry would need a decent broom if they were to compete, and explained to Harry that he would make an excellent Seeker, perhaps rivalling the legendary Charlie Weasley.  Harry told Ron about everything that happened after he left with McGonagall over dinner that night, but warned him that Wood wanted to keep it a secret.

The destination of their journey was Bhutan. The walk of the Qilin was to be held there, and a new Supreme Mugwump was to be elected.[16]  Dumbledore invited his crew to dinner at Hog's Head, where Aberforth prepared a meal for them. Albus explained to Aberforth that Credence was the son of Aberforth, the fruit of a relationship with a girl from Godric's Hollow. It turned out that Newt had overheard their conversation. After Aberforth left the room, Albus told Newt the truth about Credence and that the boy was dying and could not be saved. He also revealed that his sister, Ariana, was an Obscurial like Credence, and that she died as a result of a fight between him, Aberforth and Grindelwald. Newt tried to cheer Albus, but to no avail, as Albus blamed himself for his sister's death.[16]  Later, Dumbledore waited with Bunty for Newt, Theseus, Jacob and Lally in the Room of Requirement. There were five identical suitcases waiting for them, in one of them was hidden Qilin. Dumbledore asked Newt if he knew which of the suitcases was real, to which Newt replied that he did not know. Dumbledore replied that it was good, because if he had known, the plan would not work. Dumbledore had successfully planned an escape plan in case Grindelwald's men would attack. The three suitcases contained enchanted books, Quaffle, Bludgers, and Jacob's pastries that would attack the Grindelwald's acolytes in case of trouble. Everyone, apart from Albus, took one suitcase and they all used a Qilin Ceremony Portkey to the Magisterial Chamber of Ancient Wizardry in Bhutan. Dumbledore and Jacob went\nfirst, the rest followed.[16]  The Qilin bowing before Dumbledore During the ceremony, Grindelwald used the revived Qilin, which bowed to him, making him the new Supreme Mugwump. Dumbledore witnessed how Grindelwald used the Cruciatus Curse on Jacob. Newt, however, wanted to expose Grindelwald, and with the help of Credence, revealed that Grindelwald was a liar. When Bunty appeared, Newt pulled a second Qilin from the suitcase. The second Qilin bowed before Albus. While honoured by the Qilin's selection, he declined to assume office, saying there was a second person equally deserving to be Supreme Mugwump. Ultimately, Vic\u00eancia Santos won the election, as the Qilin bowed to her. Out of anger, Grindelwald cast a Killing Curse at Credence, which was deflected by Albus and Aberforth.[16]  The deflected curse damaged the blood pact's pendant, which Dumbledore owned. The vial was destroyed, because neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald thought of attacking each other; one wanted to kill someone, the other wanted to defend. Immediately, both wizards duelled each other, which ended in an impasse. When the Aurors and the rest gathered to capture Grindelwald, he told Albus before Disapparating that he had never been their enemy, now or then.[16]  Later Dumbledore witnessed Newt, Tina Goldstein, Theseus, and Lally attending Jacob's and Queenie Goldstein's wedding in New York City. Albus thanked Newt for his help, to which Newt replied that if Albus asked him again, he would help him.[16]  Dumbledore arriving at Wool's Orphanage At some point in his career, Albus also became involved with the recruitment of students for Hogwarts, becoming a special messenger for the school whose job it was to visit the young witches and wizards whose names appeared in the Book of Admittance and came from Muggle families in order to explain to their parents that magic existed and to deliver the acceptance letter in person. Most prominent among the students he recruited was Tom Riddle in 1938, who resided at Wool's Orphanage in London.[45] For the purposes of fulfilling his duty as the school's messenger, Dumbledore wrote to the matron, Mrs Cole, to schedule a meeting with her to discuss arrangements for the boy's future. Because young Riddle was a ward of the state and she the custodian of the institution at which he lived rather than the boy's legal guardian, however, Albus was purposefully vague in his reasons for wanting to meet the boy.  Thinking he might be a family member wanting to claim him, she accepted the preposition and, at the agreed upon time and date, Professor Dumbledore presented himself at the establishment in question. Shown in by one of the employees, Albus was formally introduced to Mrs Cole, who invited him to join him in her office to talk about the reasons for his visit. The news that Tom had been accepted to attend the school where Albus taught came as a surprise to Mrs Cole, who at Dumbledore's request recounted Tom Riddle's history at the orphanage, mostly notably the circumstances of Tom's birth, his anti-social behaviour and his extraordinary bad influence on the\nother children; including some very nasty incidents that resulted in the death of a pet rabbit and a gathering with several of his peers in a cave that left them traumatised.[45]  Dumbledore meeting Tom Riddle Once it became clear that Albus would not be dissuaded from his mission, however, Mrs Cole agreed to let him meet the prospective student and escorted him to the upper floor to the boy's room, where the two were formally introduced. Initially suspicious and hostile towards him, Albus found himself having to assure the boy that he was not, in fact, a doctor that had come to lock him up at the asylum; showing his awareness of the matron's suspicions about his behaviour, and was finally able to extend the invitation to Hogwarts and inform him that he was, in fact, a wizard. And though he was impressed to hear, as Mrs Cole's testimony suggested, how well-developed his powers were for such a young wizard, as well as how his degree of control over them was such that he had already begun to use them intentionally. It was also during this encounter that Albus first learned that the boy was a Parselmouth; a fact that he did not find nearly as concerning as the boy's \"obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy and domination\".[46]  Upon discovering that Riddle had stolen from the other children at the orphanage, Dumbledore admonished him for his behaviour and instructed him return the items to their rightful owners and apologise for taking them, warning him that he had exercised his abilities in a manner that would be unacceptable at Hogwarts, should he agree to attend. Thereafter, Dumbledore provided him with enough information to find Diagon Alley and Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, as well as a stipend from school funds so that he could purchase his books and other equipment. On account of his conduct around his peers, Dumbledore became immediately suspicious of and resolved to keep a close eye on him during his studies at the school.[46]  Professor Dumbledore talking with Tom Riddle during the first opening of the Chamber of Secrets, 1943 At an unknown point in time, Dumbledore became the Professor of Transfiguration. In the 1942\u20131943 school year, several Muggle-born students were mysteriously petrified by a beast rumoured to have been released by the Heir of Slytherin from the mythical Chamber of Secrets. Indeed, the final victim of the beast, Myrtle Warren, was actually killed; this act seemed likely to ensure the permanent closure of the school, forcing Riddle to go back to the orphanage. While Dumbledore rightly suspected Riddle was behind the attacks, the aspiring Dark wizard expertly framed Gryffindor student Rubeus Hagrid as the perpetrator.[47]  Riddle was able to pass off Hagrid's tamed Acromantula, Aragog, as the beast attacking students, resulting in Hagrid's expulsion and ensuring that Hogwarts remained open. Dumbledore was never able to uncover hard evidence implicating Riddle, however, he nonetheless kept a very close watch over Riddle, preventing him", "PPL": 0.2618115246295929, "PPL/lower": 0.39641453679001465, "PPL/zlib": 7.4314937448082e-05, "Min-5%": 4.911155018151975, "Min-10%": 2.6115338015826604, "Min-20%": 1.3086105194073716, "Min-30%": 0.8724396345110804, "Min-40%": 0.6550511944366799, "Min-50%": 0.523846610587647, "Min-60%": 0.4364151080786269}, {"text": "nake Nagini; the attack was witnessed by Harry, through his mental connection with the Dark Lord.

Because of Harry witnessing the event and alerting Dumbledore to it Arthur survived the attack and hence he was transported to St Mungo's in time.[19]  Arthur during Christmas Arthur was required to take a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. At the suggestion of trainee Healer Augustus Pye, he tried stitches, a Muggle alternative, which Molly did not like. However, the stitches were not effective; Nagini's fangs apparently had a poison that dissolved them prematurely. Eventually, an antidote to the poison was found and he was cured, coming home to find fellow Order members Severus Snape and Sirius Black in the middle of a heated\nargument. Despite this near death experience, Percy did not so much as question about his father's well-being.[19]  After the Ministry finally accepted the truth that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned to power, Arthur was promoted to the Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. He had no less than ten people working under him. However, this promotion by Rufus Scrimgeour might have been an unsuccessful way of trying to warm Harry up to the Ministry, given the time frame of events that took place.[24]  Arthur at the Burrow along with Molly, Tonks, and Lupin Scrimgeour was put down by Dumbledore on the idea of Dumbledore approaching Harry on Scrimgeour's behalf to get Harry to become a \"mascot\" for the Ministry of Magic. Having been told by Dumbledore that Harry would not want anything to do with the Ministry following the events of the previous year at Hogwarts, Scrimgeour, who knew that Harry was close to the Weasley family, might have then decided to promote Arthur so that Harry would possibly be more open to joining the Ministry (Molly did say that Arthur's promotion had been within days of Harry's arrival at the Burrow). During the summer, the Burrow also became the home of his son Bill's new fianc\u00e9e, Fleur Delacour, much to his wife Molly's dismay.[24]  The Burrow was later placed under the highest security the Ministry could provide, due to arrangements to have Harry Potter stay there for the summer holiday. During this time Arthur would sometimes bring home news of odd accidents or disappearances. One of these disappearances was that of Garrick Ollivander, he brought home the news before it even reached the Daily Prophet.[24]  Harry confiding in Arthur his suspicions regarding Draco Malfoy Arthur later accompanied several of his family members, as well as Harry and Hermione, to Diagon Alley, under the Ministry protection of Rubeus Hagrid. Harry later spoke to Arthur about suspecting Draco Malfoy of joining the Death Eaters and having purchased a Dark artefact from Borgin and Burkes to presumably use at Hogwarts, before leaving himself for Hogwarts. Later, Arthur once more personally searched Malfoy Manor for any possible Dark objects, to no avail.[24]  That year, he sent a letter to his son, Ron to inform the latter that Harry's suspicions were correct.[24]  Arthur spending Christmas with his family, Harry Potter, and Remus Lupin Harry, Ron, and Ginny spent Christmas at the Burrow, where Harry tried to persuade Arthur and Remus Lupin that there was indeed something Dark about Draco Malfoy. His argument went unheard, as neither believed his theory regarding him. Arthur also tried to keep the peace between Molly and Fleur during the Christmas holidays, the latter of whom had made a negative comment about a song Molly was particularity fond of.[24]  Newly appointed Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour also arrived at the Burrow, with Arthur's son Percy in tow. Molly was overjoyed to see Percy, while Arthur and the twins remained stone-faced. When the Minister announced his\nintention to speak to Harry alone Arthur prepared to speak, but Harry dismissed him stating that it was fine. Scrimgeour attempted to recruit Harry, with little success, while Percy once again fell out with his family.[24]  Harry's suspicions about Draco Malfoy were later proved to be true. He helped Death Eaters to infiltrate Hogwarts and Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape. Arthur and Molly later arrived at Hogwarts shortly after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower to see their son Bill, who was gravely injured by Fenrir Greyback during the conflict. The Weasley family sadly attended the funeral of Dumbledore, a man they respected greatly and who had led them as the head of the Order of the Phoenix.[24]  Arthur and Mad-Eye Moody at 4th Privet Drive During the summer holidays, Arthur participated in the plan to evacuate Harry from the home of his aunt and uncle, before his seventeenth birthday. This was done due to Harry needing more protection from Voldemort and his Death Eaters, along with the protection of having a \"place to call home\" being broken on his seventeenth birthday. The original plan of evacuation was to have Alastor Moody side-along Apparate Harry to the Burrow, but that plan was moot as Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was under the influence of the Imperius Curse and had sealed off the house. Arthur flew with his son Fred.[9]  Arthur finding out about George's loss of an ear after the battle Unfortunately, dozens of Death Eaters ambushed the Order members and the Battle of the Seven Potters ensued. Alastor Moody was murdered by Voldemort himself in the conflict, while Arthur's son George lost an ear at the hands of Severus Snape, and Harry's owl Hedwig was killed by an unknown Death Eater. Harry, however, was successfully transported to the Burrow, which was protected by powerful enchantments. Arthur was confronted on arrival by Kingsley Shacklebolt out of paranoia of him being an impostor or otherwise bewitched; his fatherly concern for George caused the normally laid-back and calm Arthur to not only yell at, but threaten his friend and ally with bodily harm if he did not back off and let him see his injured son.  Arthur greeting Fleur's family the wedding in 1997 During the wedding of Bill and Fleur, Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus arrived informing the guests that the Ministry of Magic had fallen to Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The current Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, was brutally tortured and murdered. Death Eaters then interrupted the reception and the Weasley family was placed under constant watch. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, escaped to 12 Grimmauld Place.   After they arrived, Arthur's weasel Patronus appeared and informed them that the rest of the family was safe, but warned them not to attempt contact as that might cause problems.[9]  However, Harry saw Arthur again while disguised as Albert Runcorn by use of Polyjuice Potion when he, Hermione, and Ron infiltrated the Ministry of Magic. He found out that Arthur was under\nsurveillance by the Voldemort-controlled Ministry for his \"blood traitor\" status. Arthur was one of the few people who made his disgust for the Ministry's anti-Muggle and Muggle-born stance very clear. He confronted Albert Runcorn (actually Harry Potter in disguise) who seems to have been considered very intimidating by most Ministry employees, about turning Muggle-born wizard Dirk Cresswell into the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.[9]  Arthur's Ministry file, kept in Dolores Umbridge's desk Arthur also had a file at the Ministry regarding his blood-status, his family's status, and his status in the Ministry. The file was kept in Dolores Umbridge's office. Harry tried to warn Arthur that his movements were being monitored by the Ministry, but Arthur thought he was trying to threaten him.[9]  When Harry accidentally broke the Taboo on Voldemort's name in 1998, the Death Eaters realised that Ron was with Harry, and the other Weasleys, including Arthur, were forced into hiding and prevented from going to work. They stayed with Molly's Aunt Muriel during this time.[9]  Arthur duelling a Death Eater during the Battle of Hogwarts In May, Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Rowling has commented that Draco is very capable of compartmentalising his life, which makes him skilled at Occlumency and at bullying others.[40]  She also compared Draco to his first cousin once removed, Regulus Black, in that they were both initially attracted to the Death Eater organisation, but 'the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle'.[40] Rowling also compared Draco to Dudley Dursley; in addition to both being bullies, Draco was also 'raised as a pampered only son, indoctrinated with his parents' beliefs'.

At least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery & Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells & Harry Potter: Magic Awakened & Hogwarts Legacy. As such, spoilers will be present within the article. Each spell in the list is described in a text block, separated by an empty line. The name of the spell, the type, the spell description and optionally the reference and the etymology are provided in each text block.\n\nSpell name: Aberto\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: Portuguese for 'open'. Compare Spanish 'abierto'.\nDescription: A spell used to open doors; it is probably related to Alohamora.\n\nSpell name: Accio\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: The Latin word accio means \"I call\" or \"I summon\".\nDescription: Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is casted nonverbally). This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it. The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target as long as they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledore's office simply by saying \"Accio Horcrux books!\" while in Gryffindor Tower.\n\nSpell name: Age Line\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Prevents people above or below a certain age from access to a target.\n\nSpell name: Aguamenti\nSpell type: Charm, Conjuration\nEtymology: Possibly a hybrid of Latin words aqua, which means \"water\", and menti, which means \"for the mind\".\nDescription: Produces a clean, drinkable jet of water from the wand tip.\n\nSpell name: Alarte Ascendare\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: Ascendere is a Latin infinitive meaning \"to go up,\"\"to climb,\" \"to embark,\" \"to rise(figuratively);\" this is the origin of the English word \"ascend\".\nDescription: Shoots the target high into the air.\n\nSpell name: Albus Dumbledore's forceful spell\nSpell type: Spell\nDescription: This spell was, supposedly, quite powerful as when it was cast, the opponent was forced to conjure a silver shield to deflect it.\n\nSpell name: Alohomora\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: The incantation is derived from the West African Sidiki dialect used in geomancy; it means \"friendly to thieves\".\nDescription: Unlocks doors and other locked objects. It can also unlock doors that have been sealed with a Locking Spell, although it is possible to bewitch doors to become unaffected by this spell.\n\nSpell name: Amato Animo Animato Animagus\nSpell type: Transfiguration\nEtymology: Amato is a conjugation of the Latin word amo, which means \"I love\" or \"I am obliged to\". Animo and animato are both different conjugations of the Latin word animo, which can mean \"I animate\" or \"I fill with breath or life\". Animagus on the other hand appears to be a portmanteau of animo or \"animal\", and magus, which is Latin for \"wizard\".[citation needed] Overall, the incantation can roughly mean \"My love brings me life, I am obliged to become an animal wizard.\"\nDescription: Spell used as part of the process of becoming an Animagus. The incantation has to be recited at sunrise and sundown, every day before the consumption of the Animagus Potion. The incantation is also recited just prior to the consumption of the potion, which has to take place just after a lightning storm starts. The incantation is recited while placing the", "PPL": 0.3971363306045532, "PPL/lower": 0.3251564526175837, "PPL/zlib": 0.00012418271751236812, "Min-5%": 6.486936728159587, "Min-10%": 3.8430184407853614, "Min-20%": 1.979902181464696, "Min-30%": 1.3226321179120943, "Min-40%": 0.9934571338900021, "Min-50%": 0.7945531868747502, "Min-60%": 0.6619716350450784}, {"text": "his family. Percy also expressed his wish to take part in the fight against Voldemort's encroaching army. Arthur and Percy reconciled, and all the Weasleys took part in the battle.   Arthur and the other defenders of Hogwarts witnessing Harry Potter's final defeat of Voldemort During the second half of the battle, he and Percy duelled and defeated Pius Thicknesse and also witnessed his wife kill Bellatrix Lestrange after she nearly killed Ginny. He also witnesses Harry's final defeat of Voldemort. During the battle, Arthur lost his son, Fred, which devastated him, his wife and the rest of their children, as well as Harry and Hermione.[9] After the Battle, he was seen sitting with several members of his family.  A younger Arthur Having moved back to the Burrow following the Battle of Hogwarts with his wife, in the years that followed, their family grew even larger, with most of his children marrying and having children of their own.[25] Shortly after the final battle, Arthur returned to his old job as Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,[11] as he had previously missed working with Muggle artefacts during his stint at the larger division.[26] Sometime after this, however, Arthur, who presumably embraced the efforts to de-corrupt the Ministry by Kingsley Shacklebolt, later rose to a higher office within the Ministry when he was promoted to the Head of Department.[12]  Their home also became \"quite the photo op for wizarding history buffs\" following the publishing of a book titled One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War,[27] whereupon its role as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix became public knowledge. Ron suggested that they should charge a fee for the number of tourists that subsequently showed up to photograph and be photographed with their old front sign, an idea that Arthur firmly\nrefused to go along with.[28]  Arthur, a retired septuagenarian By 2020, his son-in-law Harry Potter had taken over as Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[29] Noted to have been particularly proud of the accomplishment that was Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, in his old age, Arthur was often found perusing their products while visiting Diagon Alley.[28]  Following the outbreak of the Calamity, Arthur, while retired, still assisted the newly created Statute of Secrecy Task Force in returning Foundables that had been displaced in the Muggle world.[27] Around the same time, a younger version of himself appeared as a Foundable, forcing volunteer members of the SOS Task Force to track him down to free him, allowing him to return to his original time.[30]  Like many other members of the Weasley family, Arthur had bright red hair, though he was balding by the early 1990s. He wore glasses and had green eyes, and also possessed the tall, thin build inherited by his sons Ron and Bill.[20]  He also had visible marks somewhere on his body from a decent caning whilst at Hogwarts, for being late. The punishment was set by the caretaker at the time, Apollyon Pringle.[16]  Arthur fighting with Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts In the wizarding world, Arthur Weasley was known for being a well-meaning, reasonable and competent every-man, trying to take care of his family and do the right thing. A man of principle, he was strongly opposed to the discrimination of Muggles, Muggle-borns, half-bloods, half-breeds, and cursed beings such as werewolves, and did not think highly of those who subscribed to such intolerant beliefs, despite it being the prevailing views of so many of his fellow pure-bloods. While this earned him respect of his friends and family, others, such as Lucius Malfoy, considered him to be a \"blood traitor.\"[20] and a \"disgrace to the name of wizard\". The latter, however, he never truly took to heart, as his opinion about what disgraced the name of wizard differed greatly from theirs.   While Arthur Weasley was often seen as \"fun\" in the earlier years, with the return of Lord Voldemort and the gathering crisis in the wizarding world he shouldered a role of increasing challenges, assuming duties within the Order of the Phoenix in addition to new responsibilities at the Ministry. He was protective of Harry, and at times assumed a father like role, a position previously occupied by Harry's godfather Sirius Black, and by Albus Dumbledore. He was a man of principle and remained loyal to Dumbledore, even though this impeded his advancement in the Ministry of Magic and cost him the respect of Percy, who also worked at the Ministry but agreed more strongly with the policies of the Minister for Magic.   A devoted father, Arthur was the more laid-back parent than his wife, but was nevertheless very protective of them, and loved his own flesh and blood so much that the only times he was seen to lose control of himself was when any of his children were hurt. In\naddition, he could also get just as angry at them as his wife if they did something very seriously bad; an example of this was when he went berserk on catching Fred and George trying to trick Ron into making an Unbreakable Vow, a potentially lethal act of magic, and his reaction was so pronouncedly different from his usual temperament that Ron still recalled it over a decade later and Fred swore at least one part of his anatomy was never the same since.  Arthur with Mr and Mrs Granger in Flourish and Blotts Arthur was fascinated at how Muggles were able to go about their lives without magic. Whenever he found himself in close proximity to them, he had a hard time containing his enthusiasm. During Harry's stays at the Burrow, he liked to sit next to Harry, in order to ask him questions about living with them and had at various times attempted to engage the Dursleys in conversation about electricity. In 1992, when he learned Harry had never travelled by the Floo Network, he joyfully began to ask about the \"escapators\" in the London Underground. When the Weasleys and Harry met Hermione Granger in Diagon Alley that same year, Arthur was ecstatic to meet Hermione's parents, both Muggles, who were exchanging money at Gringotts. While the other family members went shopping for school supplies, Arthur insisted on taking Mr and Mrs Granger for a drink in the Leaky Cauldron.[20]  In addition to his Ford Anglia, Arthur also collected a number of other Muggle items. He had a large collection of plugs and batteries, as well as other undisclosed items in his shed. After successfully transporting Harry to the Burrow in the aftermath of the Battle of the Seven Potters, Arthur showed Harry the remains of Sirius' motorcycle and told him he was eager to learn how the brakes worked and that he also wanted to put it back together when Molly was not around. In time, Arthur did put it back together and returned it to Harry.[9] When given the chance to use matches to light a bonfire, Arthur enjoyed it immensely, even though he was not successful.  Harry Potter surrounded by Arthur's collection of Muggle objects Because of his fondness for Muggles, in 1992, he drafted a proposition for the Ministry called the Muggle Protection Act. Many pure-blood wizards took offence to this, and Lucius Malfoy attempted to sabotage Arthur's plans; by planting Riddle's diary on Arthur's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and bury the legislation.[20] So adamant in protecting Muggles, he was outraged at Fred and George's prank on Dudley Dursley, even though the twins did not target Dudley because he was a Muggle, but rather he was a horrible boy.   When he took his family, Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, he was adamant about remaining incognito. He insisted on putting up their tents by hand and cooking their food outside with a fire. While somewhat familiar with the concept, he had trouble with a Muggle\nmatchbox; he would light a match and subsequently drop it in surprise. In the end, he managed to get the fire lit with Hermione's help and seemed to have a great time. When Death Eaters started a riot after the cup, Arthur was one of the people who acted to protect Muggle victims.[16]  His wall in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office was covered with Muggle pictures, including several of Muggle cars (one of which was a disassembled motor) Muggle", "PPL": 0.1488453596830368, "PPL/lower": 0.26028890881338707, "PPL/zlib": 4.0601571108302454e-05, "Min-5%": 2.9185306374348845, "Min-10%": 1.4841606350314311, "Min-20%": 0.7435147698347008, "Min-30%": 0.49587888144740094, "Min-40%": 0.3723724152950324, "Min-50%": 0.2978051277214649, "Min-60%": 0.24810701755946207}, {"text": "Voldemort. She snapped their wands and killed Craig Bowker Jnr who was sent to find them, before she made Albus and Scorpius travel back in time with her to the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.  Albus and Scorpius, knowing the Time-Turner only kept them in the past for five minutes, tried to stall Delphi and ended up meeting Cedric Diggory in the maze. Cedric helped Albus and Scorpius and retrieved the Time-Turner, believing it to be part of the tournament. As he left, Albus and Scorpius told him that his father Amos loved him. However, Delphi managed to get the Time-Turner back and went back in time to 30 October 1981, the day before James and Lily Potter died. Delphi then destroyed the Time-Turner and left, abandoning Albus and Scorpius.  Scorpius reunited with his father Believing Delphi hoped to murder Harry herself so the spell wouldn't rebound on Voldemort, Albus and Scorpius went to Godric's Hollow and saw James and Lily alive with their baby Harry. To warn everyone in the future what is happening, Albus and Scorpius used Harry's blanket to send a message through time. Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Draco deciphered the message and used a more advanced Time-Turner to travel back to 1981 and join their children.  Ginny realised Delphi only meant to stop Voldemort going into the house and murdering the Potters, so his downfall never happened. Harry transfigured himself to look like Voldemort and planned to apprehend Delphi. Delphi pleaded with Voldemort, actually Harry, to accept her. However, the Transfiguration spell faded, and Delphi and\nHarry duelled. Scorpius and the others joined Harry and finally stopped Delphi. They then returned to the present.  After their traumatic experiences with the time-turner, Albus and Scorpius returned to normal life and Scorpius asked Rose to be his friend, and she turned him down, but Scorpius was excited because she had pity in her eyes and not hate, saying it \"was a foundation for a palace of harmony\". Albus asked if she\u2019s who he wanted in his palace and they had a brief moment of acknowledging their feelings for each other. Rose told them that it was only going to be weird if they let it be weird and Scorpius gave Albus a big hug before going off to watch Slytherin play Hufflepuff at Quidditch.  Scorpius inherited his father Draco's physical traits, meaning that he likely had blond hair, grey eyes, and a pale pointed face. He was also noted for looking almost the same as his father did at age eleven. He was said to resemble Draco as much as Albus Potter resembled Harry Potter.[5]  Scorpius was shown to be a brave, intelligent, and understanding individual. However, despite his traits, he was shown to be incredibly lonely and insecure, who suffered from slight depression throughout his childhood and eventual years at Hogwarts. Scorpius was noted to be extremely kind, according to Albus.  Scorpius was known to have a personality that Albus and himself describe as \"nerdy\" and \"geeky\", and was known to be something of a loner. A consummate social outcast, Scorpius relied on his romantic and amorous personality to lighten his burdens in life. A particular trait of his was his long-standing romantic interest in Rose Granger-Weasley, his best friend's cousin and unreachable goal. Scorpius was rather persistent when he wanted something and vaguely shows his ambitious side in the fact that no other girl has ever caught his eye before, potentially referencing another part of his identity he, himself had yet to figure out. His overall neutral want to restore Rose's existence to the timeline shows that his interest in her was apparently more than just a simple schoolboy crush to the audience and can be implied that he actually loves her. However, this desperation to restore a timeline was sidelined by the overwhelming relationship between Scorpius and Albus as well as the confirmation from Snape that Scorpius was generally \"giving up his kingdom\" by restoring the timelines all for Albus.[8]  Living in a timeline without Albus being his friend was shown to be more unbearable and saddening for Scorpius than living in a timeline without Rose's existence altogether.[9]  Scorpius was also known to be prone to feelings of jealousy. His jealousy was shown from when Scorpius once observed Albus showing interest in a girl, Delphi. In an alternate timeline when Albus was ordered by his father to stay away from Scorpius, Delphi admitted that in the letters Albus wrote to her so she could feel Scorpius's absence from his life. Scorpius retorted that it seemed like he had found another shoulder\nto cry on and inquired how many owls they had sent to one another. Through his backhanded comment, this jealousy can be inferred, but it was unknown what these complicated feelings really meant.  In another alternate timeline where Albus was never born and Voldemort ruled, Scorpius was apparently more of a bully, as he allegedly forced Craig Bowker Jnr to do his homework for him. The Scorpius who inadvertently made this timeline shift was rather surprised and shocked at this revelation.  His wand Scorpius had a close relationship with both his parents. He loved his mother very much, and was very grief-stricken by her death. He believed she saw the best in him and his father. His relationship with his father was slightly different, but he loved and admired him very much, believing he could depend on him to save him. He confided in his father who he relied on for comfort following his mother's death and had his approval for his friendship with Albus. Astoria and Draco raised Scorpius with the love and affection they did not have when they were children, and cared for him and his wellbeing. Unlike Draco himself, they did not spoil Scorpius, nor teach him their families' historical prejudice against Muggles. Indeed, when Scorpius and Albus were facing punishment for using the Time-Turner that caused a catastrophic change in reality (that he managed to reverse), Draco was prepared to accept any punishment that Professor McGonagall was about to hand down to the students.  Scorpius with his best friend Albus Scorpius became friends with Albus Potter when they met on the Hogwarts Express during their first journey to Hogwarts, even though Albus was the son of Harry Potter, the former archrival of Scorpius's father. They awkwardly introduced themselves and shared a compartment, sharing sweets and stories. They were later placed in Slytherin together and became close during their first few years at Hogwarts even though they were made fun of by other students. Albus became isolated because of the jokes being made about him which led Harry to believe that Scorpius was the one influencing him instead. He told Albus to end his friendship with Scorpius which he refused to do.  In their fourth year, Scorpius decided to help Albus change the past by time-travelling to 1994 and trying to save Cedric Diggory. In one alternate reality, they did not speak to each other for a few weeks when Harry told Albus to end their friendship again, which immensely upset Scorpius. Regardless, the two later made up and took another trip in time. Scorpius was upset when he found out they had created another alternate reality where Albus no longer existed, and resolved to put time right again.   Scorpius and Albus at Hogwarts He was later happily reunited with Albus where which he hugged him while submerged in water. On their next trip in time, he helps him and Harry duel Delphi. They later returned to normal school life, with the approval of Harry to be friends again.  Scorpius was\napparently romantically interested in Rose Granger-Weasley, complimenting her by saying she smelled of something nice, \"like a mixture of fresh flowers and fresh bread\".[15] After helping to restore Rose's existence in the current timeline, he attempted to hug her after she called him \"Bread-head\", but was welcomed with a kick to the shin. Near the end of his fourth year, Scorpius asked Rose out, however, he was rejected. Interestingly, at the very last moment, Rose passed Scorpius and Albus on the stairs.

Their initial attempt to save Buckbeak failed, as Lucius Malfoy frightened the Committee into deciding that the creature would be executed. Hermione was extremely upset by this news and grew furious to the point of slapping Draco Malfoy when he dared to mock Hagrid for his tears and being upset over Buckbeak's fate.  That year, Hermione was among the students who found Remus Lupin to be the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they have ever had. She cleverly deduced that Professor Lupin was a werewolf, based on his Boggart taking the form of a full moon, the timing of his unexplained absences from class, and Professor Snape changing a lesson he took over to the subject of werewolves even though it wasn't due on the syllabus for weeks. However, she didn't expose Lupin, presumably because she believed he was a good teacher and didn't agree with the prejudice many hold against werewolves.   Trelawney telling Hermione that she does not possess the Second Sight Divination, on the other hand, turned out to be a subject Hermione had no respect or interest in. She considered it a \"woolly subject\" and mocked it to Harry and Ron. She also considered it less interesting then the subject of Ancient Runes. She also believed that Divination was an imprecise branch of magic, an option she and Professor McGonagall shared.[33] She soon dropped the subject after Professor Sybill Trelawney told her that she did not posses the Second Sight.   Professor Lupin and Sirius Black with the trio, before forcing Pettigrew into human form On the day of Buckbeak's execution, the trio ventured down to console Hagrid. While in his cabin, Hermione discovered Scabbers, Ron's lost rat. Hagrid urged them to leave and they witnessed from a distance what they believed to be Buckbeak's execution. Before they could return to their dormitory, Scabbers bit Ron and fled. While chasing after the rat, they were attacked by a black dog, which pulled Ron by the leg into a tunnel beneath the Whomping Willow, which then attacked them. \nAfterward, Hermione and Harry hurried after them eventually arriving in the Shrieking Shack, where Sirius Black, whose Animagus form was the black dog, confronted them. They were soon joined by Professor Lupin who was acting strangely, and Hermione told Harry and Ron of her belief that he was a werewolf, which he then confirmed. It was revealed that Sirius had been framed for the betrayal of James and Lily Potter, and that the true traitor was Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding from the world as Ron's pet rat. Hermione also cast Expelliarmus on Snape when he discovered them, knocking him out, at which she was horrified.  Harry, Hermione, and Sirius being attacked by Dementors at the Black Lake Once it had been decided that Pettigrew would be turned over to the authorities rather than murdered, the motley group left the Shrieking Shack. When the full moon appeared, chaos ensued as Lupin transformed into a werewolf as, due to the chaotic turn of events, he hadn't taken the Wolfsbane potion that Professor Snape produced for him monthly in order for him to retain his humanity. In the chaos, Pettigrew attacked Ron and escaped, and Sirius had to transform into his dog form in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the werewolf. After Lupin was eventually distracted by a howl from the Forbidden Forest, Hermione and Harry rushed to Sirius' aid when they heard him moaning, but hundreds of Dementors descended on them, come to recapture Sirius who quickly fainted, and Harry told Hermione to think of something happy and attempt to cast a patronus as he was trying to himself, but she was unable to cast one.  As Harry conjured an incorporeal Patronus, Hermione passed out, leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone. Harry held them off for a while but was eventually overwhelmed. The Dementors were about to perform the Kiss on Harry, Hermione, and Sirius when a mysterious figure in the distance cast a very powerful Patronus Charm to repel the Dementors. Unable to see properly in the resulting blinding light, Harry thought he glimpsed his father just before he, too, lost consciousness.  Harry and Hermione using the Time-turner Harry and Hermione awoke in the Hospital Wing after being rescued by Severus Snape, who conjured stretchers for Hermione, Harry and Sirius. After realising that Sirius' soul was to be destroyed by the Dementor's Kiss and receiving vague, though instructive and useful, instructions from Dumbledore, Hermione used her Time-Turner to return herself and Harry to a time earlier in the evening. It was a very difficult task and Harry had to be constantly reminded by Hermione to stay concealed as being seen could cause irreparable damage to their timelines. Hermione agreed with Harry that it was difficult to watch their problems again, but she strictly said that they could do nothing about it, as bad things happened to wizards who tried to meddle with their past and future lives.  Harry and Hermione setting Sirius Black and Buckbeak free The two did, however, successfully use the\nopportunity to rescue Sirius and also Buckbeak, as it was hinted by Dumbledore that more than one innocent life could be spared that night.[33] Whilst waiting, she discussed their saviour with Harry, and when Harry realised that it was not his father he saw but himself having travelled back in time, she claimed that none but a powerful wizard could have conjured a Patronus to drive away that many Dementors. As evidenced by her assertion that time-travelling was extremely dangerous, Hermione took great personal risk to save Sirius and Buckbeak. At the end of the year Hermione returned her Time-Turner, claiming it caused too much trouble and that she would drop a few subjects instead, which was a very big surprise to everyone.  Ron, Harry, and Hermione after the riot of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Before her fourth year at Hogwarts, Hermione spent much of the summer holidays at the Burrow with Harry and Ron, sharing a room with Ginny Weasley. With the other Weasleys (excluding Molly Weasley), they attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in August. After the game, the communal campsite was set upon by Death Eaters. Hermione, Harry, and Ron fled into the woods and witnessed the casting of Morsmordre. Initially caught up in the chaos surrounding the effort to catch the caster, she took exception to the accusations levelled against Harry, and the many wizards' treatment of the house-elf Winky who had also been at the scene.  Once at Hogwarts, it was revealed to the students that former Auror Alastor Moody (who was, in fact, a polyjuiced Barty Crouch Jnr) was to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Lupin having left at the end of the previous year due to Snape outing his werewolf status. Moody was a hands-on professor who believed in a practical approach when it came to defence. One of his earliest lessons was on the Unforgivable Curses. Hermione and her fellow classmates witnessed the curse's effects on a spider.   The first \"meeting\" of the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare Hermione began a crusade for the liberation of house-elves by beginning the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or what she and the group called S.P.E.W, (or, as Ronald Weasley called it, \"spew\") having been appalled by Bartemius Crouch's abusive treatment of his house-elf Winky. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believed that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning.   Harry, Ron, and Neville only reluctantly joined S.P.E.W., mostly in order to prevent Hermione from nagging them about it. Hagrid as well as Fred and George Weasley refused to join on the grounds that it would upset the house-elves. Despite this, Fred did tell Hermione how to get into the Hogwarts kitchens. One morning she (along with Harry and Ron) visited the kitchens, where she spoke", "PPL": 0.10366687923669815, "PPL/lower": 0.1654076375186747, "PPL/zlib": 2.9459187052201806e-05, "Min-5%": 2.0378788359024944, "Min-10%": 1.0308436343912035, "Min-20%": 0.5171740779364004, "Min-30%": 0.34515386901178524, "Min-40%": 0.25928260392885405, "Min-50%": 0.20739554515473074, "Min-60%": 0.17279551910226856}, {"text": "theoretical education would suffice, a furious Hermione (fearful of being ill-equipped to deal with the reborn Lord Voldemort and the upcoming O.W.L.s) conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so. Though the secret classes were taught by Harry, Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the Hog's Head, created the DA's method of covert communication, and jinxed their member list to reveal any betrayal.   All of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year (with the exceptions of Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and later Zacharias Smith, who deserted them), as evidenced by their reunion in 1997, and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Moreover, the DA truly cemented Hermione's friendships with Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom, who were the only members, aside from Ginny Weasley, to fight alongside Hermione, Harry, and Ron at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.  The original Order of the Phoenix, her allies Hermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, when she, Harry and Ron spent several weeks at the Order's headquarters. Through her time at Grimmauld Place, Hermione got to know Alastor Moody, the most famous Auror of modern times, known for rounding up several Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War and for his growing paranoia. He and Hermione fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and later, in the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Moody was killed by Voldemort's own hand. Hermione, like the rest of the Order, was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror, \"the consummate survivor,\"[10] and disgusted by Mundungus Fletcher's desertion. Hermione, who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after Sirius Black's death, aside from being a member of the Order, took part in interrogating Fletcher, when she, Harry and Ron realised Salazar Slytherin's Locket had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place.  Hermione had great respect for Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror and eventual Minister for Magic, who was known as \"Royal\" on Potterwatch, and who saved countless lives (including Hermione, Ron and Harry's) when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding the Burrow. Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother. Though Hermione, Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the Hog's Head Pub, they finally met him in 1998, just before the Battle of Hogwarts, when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by Death Eaters. Prior to that, he sent Dobby to rescue them, along with Dean Thomas, Luna\nLovegood, Garrick Ollivander and Griphook the Goblin, from the Malfoy Manor; as it turned out, Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black's two-way mirror from Mundungus Fletcher, and been keeping an eye out for Harry.  Nymphadora Tonks, a funny, Metamorphmagus witch, who had become a good friend of Hermione's, died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order, Remus Lupin, during the Battle of Hogwarts. As their son, Ted Lupin, was Harry's godson and was also dating Hermione's niece, Victoire by 2017, it's likely Hermione remained quite close to him.  Albus Dumbledore, her former headmaster As with most aspects of the wizarding world, Hermione read about Albus Dumbledore shortly after learning that she was a witch. Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to. She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school, in 1991, and quickly came to respect Dumbledore's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with Harry Potter, he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with Ron Weasley, trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.  He respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows. Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed, and visited his portrait with Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts to determine the fate of the Hallows.  Rubeus Hagrid, her friend and professor Rubeus Hagrid was the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts, as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Since Hagrid had met Harry Potter prior to the start of Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed, eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Harry and Ron Weasley. In their second year, Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a \"a filthy little mudblood\" by Draco Malfoy.   Though she disapproved of Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron, as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half-brother Grawp. In turn, it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re-think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry's new Firebolt confiscated in their third year. When Dolores Umbridge threatened Hagrid's job during the 1995-1996 school year, Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.  Hagrid remained close to the\ntrio throughout their time at Hogwarts, and fought various battles in the course of the Second Wizarding War. In 2017, Harry's sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that Hermione and Ron's daughter would have been joining them.  Remus Lupin, her professor and friend Hermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Hermione deduced he was a werewolf during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry, Ron and Hermione whilst in the Shrieking Shack. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help Sirius Black kill Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort.   However, thanks to Harry's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. Hermione, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.  Hermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. She and Lupin both fought against the Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and survived (despite Hermione being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven Potters began, and became even more joyful", "PPL": 0.13255736231803894, "PPL/lower": 0.2760232185608983, "PPL/zlib": 3.848936188096369e-05, "Min-5%": 2.6208400257370053, "Min-10%": 1.3243373512637382, "Min-20%": 0.6626260635476618, "Min-30%": 0.44173033951712676, "Min-40%": 0.331661497782575, "Min-50%": 0.2652291784944688, "Min-60%": 0.22096082491729757}, {"text": "in Great Britain and raised in the lap of luxury at the ancestral home of Malfoy Manor in the county of Wiltshire in England; a magnificent mansion that had been in his family's possession for around a thousand years.[15] Historically rather well-known for their cast-iron belief in wizards' superiority over Muggles and espousal of pure-blood values, Lucius adopted the unfeigned contempt for the Muggle world of his elders from a young age and was encouraged to make friends 'of the right sort' when the time came for him to attend school, a sentiment Lucius would later follow to the point where he viewed those who openly associated themselves with Muggles to be a \"disgrace to the name of wizard\".[16]  Descending from a long line of cold, brutal fathers that produced cold, brutal sons,[17] while it is unknown just how close he was with his parents during his formative years, quite arguably the biggest influence in his young life was that of his father. A proud member of the social elite that commanded great respect in certain circles, Abraxas Malfoy was, in addition to a harshly demanding parent with high expectations and known to have kept a collection of Dark magical artefacts harking back to family history, also a man of considerable (and much resented) influence at the Ministry of Magic in London; all things that Lucius would eventually go on to emulate later in life.[15]  Lucius was educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from around the year of 1965/1966 to 1972/1973, once there, he honoured his family's tradition of being Sorted into Slytherin House, a place where many other like-minded young idealists were often found.[18] It was during this time that he first met his future wife, a proud member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black; one of the most prominent pure-blooded wizarding families in Great Britain, and, like the Malfoys, one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.   Lucius's third year also saw the premature retirement of Nobby Leach, the first Muggle-born Minister for Magic to ever hold office, after he fell ill with a mysterious illness. Before long, a number of conspiracy theories were circulating regarding what\nactually happened to him, and for a time, Lucius's own father fell under suspicion of having had a hand in the shady plot that led Leach to resign, although nothing was ever proven against him.[15]  Lucius as a member of the Slug Club in his student years The scion of an old wizarding family noted for its wealth and influence, Lucius was ultimately a model student that lead by example and became a voice of authority among his peers, and who effectively managed to uphold his family's name, be a credit to Slytherin House and master the art of keeping up appearances all in one fell swoop when he was named a Prefect in his fifth year, and by being invited to join the out-of-hours dining and social club hosted by their always talent-scouting Potions Master, Horace Slughorn, known as the 'Slug Club'.[19][20]  In 1971, Lucius also became the first person apart from Lily Evans to ever extend Severus Snape a hand of friendship when he warmly welcomed him into the fold after the latter's sorting into the same house; a gesture that marked the beginning of a lifelong, mutual respect and camaraderie between the two young wizards.[21] Which was not to say, however, that his magical education was by any means an uneventful one.  Lucius's arrival at school coincided with a recent increase in Dark magical activity throughout Great Britain; while few knew what lay behind the mounting attacks and sightings, the truth was finally revealed in the form of a Dark wizard of immense power. But whereas Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters were swiftly becoming a source of widespread fear by a most of his own kind, Lucius, on the other hand, found himself rather agreeing with their views regarding the treatment that the non-magical community deserved.  Over the course of his schooling, Lucius also developed a strong dislike for the school's Head of Transfiguration.[22] Not only a shamelessly vocal pro-Muggle activist, Albus Dumbledore was also quickly becoming the biggest symbol and rallying point for opposition to the dark forces, thus representing everything that Lucius despised. As such, when Dumbledore succeeded Armando Dippet as headmaster, Lucius saw it as the worst thing ever to have happened to Hogwarts; a sentiment he would carry with him into to adulthood.[23]  Lucius graduated from Hogwarts around the year of 1972/1973, and being independently wealthy and with no need to work for a living, continued to inhabit the family estate; free at last to enjoy full-time the creature comforts that their ancestral home had provided him throughout his privileged upbringing. At some point, he also became romantically involved with Narcissa Black, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin student back at Hogwarts with whom he had a lot in common; not least of all their shared anti-Muggle sentiments, fondness for the lavish and privileged lifestyle that their rich family vaults afforded them. In due time, the uppish couple entered what was seen as a very respectable, pure-blood marriage, and took up residence at Malfoy Manor.   In doing\nso, Lucius also officially assumed both the patriarchy of the Malfoy family, ownership of their house-elf, Dobby, and gained the possession of a prized family heirloom that had been passed down for many generations.[24] This, he began to carrying around with him, both as a status symbol and as a replacement for his original wand. Heir apparent to a long line of wily beneficiaries of political patronage in the magical community, Lucius also wasted little time in carrying on the family tradition of frequenting the headquarters of the Ministry of Magic in London, where he successfully used his family name and fortune to curry favour with a number of high-ranking Ministry officials, and became a very well-connected man.[1]  That was not to say, however, that this was all he aspired to do with his life, because even though his former teachers had done an adequate job of sheltering their charges from the storm that had only continued to brew in the world beyond Hogwarts Castle in the years that he had resided there, and despite the strong-arm tactics that the Auror Office had been authorised to employ in the effort to suppress it, it was nevertheless the case that the Dark Lord's campaign of violence had just grown ever fiercer. Throughout the entirety of his magical education, Lord Voldemort and his followers had only been gaining in strength, until finally the ongoing conflict culminated in the First Wizarding War.   In the motley collection that made up Lord Voldemort's innermost circle of followers, Lucius most certainly fell into the category of \"the ambitious seeking some shared glory\". By the time Lucius left Hogwarts, rumours had also began to circulate that the Lord Voldemort, who had indulged in all manner of Dark Magic in an attempt to make himself invincible, had somehow made himself immortal,[25] thus further cementing the idea that he was unstoppable. And, being no less enthralled by their quest for the purification of the wizarding race than before, not to mention very much in favour of the idea to rid the world of Muggle-borns and putting pure-bloods in charge, Lucius eventually swore his eternal allegiance to the Dark Lord and, officially joined the ranks of the Death Eaters in earnest.[15]  Although never made privy to the names of every one of his new comrades,[26] they were all still able to tell each other apart when it mattered by the masks they wore to conceal their identities; which were all unique to the individual using them.[27] Not only was he ideally positioned supply his brothers-in-arms with important information directly from the Ministry itself, but nor did he, as an advocate for violence and unafraid to use it himself, shy away from lending an extra wand in actually waging the war either. More than willing to turn his talents to coercion,[28] torture,[29] murder[30] and other atrocities in order to carry out his Master's bidding if called upon to do so, Lucius quickly proved himself a most valuable servant to the Dark Lord.

She often fawned over him, laughing loudly at his snide jokes, showing great concern when Draco was injured by Buckbeak in their third year,[17] and accompanying him to the Yule Ball in 1994.[3] Draco and Pansy were both members of the Inquisitorial Squad and Prefects in their fifth year,[18] which is indicative of their leadership roles in Slytherin House. They are noted as being particularly cosy in their sixth year at Hogwarts, seen in the Hogwarts Express with Draco's head in Pansy's lap, Pansy stroking Draco's hair, and wasted no time in vilifying Harry for (unintentionally) slashing Draco with a deadly curse.[19] Sometime after this period, however, Pansy and Draco's friendship waned. Whether she was ever his girlfriend is unknown, but Draco eventually married Astoria Greengrass.  Draco was also friends with Theodore Nott, one\nof the few people whom he considered an equal, given that Theodore was just as pure-blooded and somewhat cleverer than him. However, Theodore was a solitary person who did not feel compelled to join any gang, including Draco's.[31] Theodore and Draco did laugh together at Hermione's blood-status once, and Nott was also seen with Draco and his gang after Harry listed their fathers names in a Quibbler article. It is also said that they had known each other prior to their arrival at Hogwarts.  He was also friends with Blaise Zabini during their sixth year, as they sat together at Hogwarts Express, where they discussed Harry Potter, Neville Longbottom, and Ginny Weasley, who had all become members of the Slug Club. Blaise was also one of the few people Draco had told about his mission, however he didn't seem to think highly of Draco's new position.  Draco also appeared to be friendly with Marcus Flint, as shown when Flint defended Draco against Fred and George Weasley, and again when he assisted Draco and his gang in their attempts to psych Harry out during a Quidditch game by disguising as dementors. Flint however did not hesitate to shout at Draco after he failed to catch a snitch despite it flying within his reach (he was too busy making fun of Harry to notice).  Severus Snape, his favourite teacher and former head of house The teacher Draco initially respected the most was Severus Snape, Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House. Snape, in turn, took Draco as his favourite student and showed him undeserved lenience on several occasions, which likely had something to do with Snape's long-time comradeship with Draco's father, or on the pretext of it, given that Snape defected from the Death Eaters. Draco even stated that Snape should apply for the position of Headmaster, after Dumbledore was suspended.  However, after Lucius's imprisonment in Azkaban, Draco came to resent and mistrust Snape, believing him to have usurped his father's place in the ranks of the Death Eaters, and that he was trying to take Draco's chance of glory as well. As such, Draco avoided Snape most of the year, refused any assistance, and even verbally assaulted him. However, Snape continued to protect him as when Draco was caught lurking outside of Professor Slughorn's Christmas party, and did not punish Draco when the boy refused to answer his summons to the office, something other students would not get off with so easily and which Draco took advantage of. Snape continued to protect Draco even after they fled from the Battle of the Astronomy Tower together; when questioned by Voldemort about Draco's actions during his attempted murder of Dumbledore, Snape lied and told the Dark Lord that Malfoy hadn't lowered his wand and emphasised the young student's ability to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts as well as cornering Dumbledore, which allowed Snape to kill him. Snape's defence of Malfoy saved the boy's life and convinced Voldemort to free Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban, for which Draco reconciled with Snape.  It\nis unknown how Draco reacted when he learned about Snape's death by Lord Voldemort in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, or of his true loyalty to the Order of the Phoenix due to his love for the Muggle-born mother of Harry Potter, Lily Evans. However, given Draco's own disillusionment with the Death Eater cause and subsequent rapprochement with Harry, it is likely that Draco came to sympathise with his late teacher. In addition, it is possible that Draco's aforementioned detente with Harry as adults might have been motivated, at least in part, to avoid having a similar relationship that Snape had with Harry's father and his friends after their own Hogwarts years.  Harry Potter, his school rival and enemy turned ally and later friend Draco became Harry Potter's arch-rival almost immediately after they met, just before their first year at Hogwarts. Draco was at first interested in Harry because he was so famous, but Harry was unimpressed by his arrogant manner. For the rest of their time at school, Harry and Draco loathed each other and tried to one up each other whenever possible, although Harry compared to Ron was less prone to incorporating violence on Draco. This reached its pinnacle after Lucius Malfoy was sent to Azkaban following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.  After finding out what Draco had gone through during their sixth year, Harry began to feel somewhat sorry for him, a feeling intensified by witnessing the use to which Lord Voldemort was putting him. During that year, Harry nearly killed Draco with the Half-Blood Prince's curse Sectumsempra (which he used by accident, unaware of what the effects of the curse were). Harry himself felt utterly horrified and guilty at what he did.[19] However, despite their enmity towards each other, Draco showed great reluctance in identifying Harry and his friends when they were imprisoned in his home. In turn, Harry saved his life twice during the Battle of Hogwarts.[21] The main reason behind Draco's enmity towards Harry was Draco's jealousy of Harry.[32]  Over the years, Draco and Harry made their peace as adults, but still were not friends by the time Scorpius and Albus started school. This later developed into a more cordial relationship due to Scorpius and Albus being best friends. Draco would grow to trust Harry's luck and instincts over the years, and knew that Harry was always in the thick of the action when it was necessary. Draco would grow to have a deep respect and friendly relationship with Albus Potter and trusted him with helping Scorpius heal from the grief of losing his mother. During the Delphini crisis, Draco would come to confess much to Harry, discussing at first in a rather distant manner, but upon revealing key details about his wife prior to and after her death as well as his family's hidden Time Turner, Draco and Harry finally came to a mutual respect for one another, and saw each other as friends for the first time, though it still did not heal everything in spite of many\nconfessions. Draco even admitted that he had always envied Harry, Ron, and Hermione's friendship.  Draco was first cousins, twice removed, with at least one member of the Potter family, through the Black family. It is almost certain that the said Potter was related to Harry, but it is unknown whether Harry and Draco were aware of it.  The Weasley family (excluding Bill and Charlie) The Malfoy family generally looked down upon the Weasley family for their lack of wealth and 'blood traitor' status, a sentiment Draco made clear immediately upon meeting Ron Weasley on the train to Hogwarts for their first year.[16] He and Ron had a hostility that mirrored that of their fathers, often insulting one another and prone even to physical fights at times. Draco also wrote the lyrics to the demeaning song Weasley is Our King, which was meant to undermine Ron's abilities as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[18]  When Crabbe set the Room of Requirement on fire, Ron assisted Harry and Hermione in pulling Draco and Goyle away, but", "PPL": 0.09109117090702057, "PPL/lower": 0.25161263156924224, "PPL/zlib": 2.613806912683517e-05, "Min-5%": 1.804098890619535, "Min-10%": 0.9097331358740727, "Min-20%": 0.45525682822762464, "Min-30%": 0.3035272766110003, "Min-40%": 0.22790777176680627, "Min-50%": 0.18225924126620346, "Min-60%": 0.15184009729031642}, {"text": "Charm\nDescription: Produces a large bubble of air around the head of the user; it is commonly used as the supernatural equivalent of a breathing set.\n\nSpell name: Bubble Spell\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Produces a stream of non-bursting bubbles from the wand tip.\n\nSpell name: Calvorio\nSpell type: Curse\nDescription: Removes the victim's hair.\n\nSpell name: Cantis\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: Cantare is Latin for \"sing\".\nDescription: Causes the victim to burst uncontrollably into song.\n\nSpell name: Capacious extremis\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Expands the internal dimensions of an object without affecting the external dimensions, enhancing its capacity, and rendering its contents lighter.\n\nSpell name: Carpe Retractum\nSpell type: Charm\nEtymology: From the Latin carpe, meaning \"to seize\" and retracto, meaning \"I draw back\".\nDescription: Produces a rope of light used to pull objects towards the caster, or, if the target is fixed in place, to pull the caster towards the target.\n\nSpell name: Cascading Jinx\nSpell type: Jinx\nDescription: Attacks multiple opponents in close proximity to each other.\n\nSpell name: Caterwauling Charm\nSpell type: Charm\nDescription: Anyone entering the perimeter of this spell sets off a high-pitched shriek.

He had to complete it if he was to finally defeat Voldemort. He was joined by Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. With four Horcruxes remaining (plus the unknown soul fragment residing inside Harry) the trio made plans.  Harry, Hermione, and Ron all remained committed to their goal to locate and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. To protect their families Hermione altered her parents' memories so that they forgot they had a daughter, then instructed them to move to Australia, and with some help from Fred, George, and their father, Ron transfigured the family ghoul to resemble himself with Spattergroit. Harry's aunt and uncle were taken into hiding by several members of the Order of the Phoenix, such as Dedalus Diggle and Hestia Jones, despite many misgivings on the part of the Dursleys.  The seven Potters Harry stayed at 4 Privet Drive for a time, but the Order of the Phoenix needed to evacuate him to the Burrow before he turned seventeen. On 27 July the Order sent the Dursleys into hiding first. Harry was surprised by Dudley's gratitude towards him for saving his soul and his sincere goodbye. Six out of thirteen of Harry's escorts took Polyjuice Potion to take on Harry's appearance in order to be diversions if they were attacked, despite Harry's protests. Harry also secretly thought that he wished they would respect his body more. Upon leaving, the group was attacked by over thirty cloaked Death Eaters. Harry rode with Hagrid on his godfather Sirius' old motorbike, that had been modified. They were attacked by multiple Death Eaters, including an Imperiused Stan Shunpike and eventually Lord Voldemort himself, who had invented and mastered unsupported flight.  Harry's wand retaliating automatically against Voldemort during the battle Harry's owl Hedwig was hit by a stray Killing Curse a Death Eater sent Harry's way. When Voldemort caught up with them, Harry thought this was the end, but his wand acted on its own to strike out at the man who was both \"kin and mortal enemy\", destroying Voldemort's borrowed wand. The chaos ended when Harry and Hagrid passed the protective enchantments placed over the house of Nymphadora Tonks' parents, although Harry was still completely grief-stricken over the death of his beloved owl. After finding Hagrid safe and sound, the pair took a Portkey to\nthe Burrow, where he found a worried Molly and Ginny Weasley standing watch outside in the darkness.  Harry and others safely at the Burrow after participating in the sky battle earlier that night Harry was relieved to see that Hermione and Ron were fine, but was shocked when Remus Lupin arrived with George Weasley, who had lost an ear. Everyone else arrived safely, but Alastor Moody who had been murdered by Voldemort and Mundungus Fletcher, who had Disapparated as soon as the fight started. Many amongst those gathered at the Burrow believed that they had been betrayed, but Harry refused to believe any of those he loved would sell him to Voldemort, much to the chagrin of Remus Lupin. Harry then stormed outside, where he was struck by a vision of Voldemort torturing Ollivander.  Once settled in at the Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione helped prepare the wedding ceremony of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. The day before the wedding, the group celebrated Harry's seventeenth birthday. Harry received a watch from Mr and Mrs Weasley, a traditional coming-of-age gift. Ginny also gave him the most passionate kiss they have ever shared. It was something to remember her by in case he \"meets some veela\" during the Horcrux hunt. Harry responded by saying that \"dating opportunities will be thin\". The pair was then interrupted by Ron and Hermione.  Scrimgeour giving the first Snitch Harry caught, willed to him by Albus Dumbledore At the party that night, Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour arrived to release the contents of Albus Dumbledore's will. Harry was left the first Snitch he had ever caught in a Quidditch match and Godric Gryffindor's Sword; Scrimgeour withheld this second gift, claiming that it was a historical magical item and was not exclusively Harry's property. Noting that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the only students mentioned by name in the will, he asked the trio why this was; the three were unable to give him an answer.  On 1 August, Harry attended Bill and Fleur's wedding disguised as a distant Weasley cousin, Barny Weasley. They used polyjuice potion and the hairs of a red-haired Muggle boy from the village to disguise him. During the party, Harry met Luna Lovegood's father, Xenophilius, (who wore a necklace bearing an Triangle-Eyed symbol) and Viktor Krum, (who dislikes the symbol for it is synonymous with the dark wizard Grindelwald, who attended Krum's school, Durmstrang). The reception was interrupted when the Patronus of Kingsley Shacklebolt arrived and announced the fall of the Ministry of Magic and the death of Rufus Scrimgeour. Chaos erupted and guests started to flee, while Harry and Hermione drew their wands and grabbed Ron before Disapparating to Tottenham Court Road.  The trio duelling Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle in Luchino Caffe There, Hermione revealed that she had planned ahead, packing supplies in her bag, which had an Undetectable Extension Charm on it. Ron changed, and Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak, and the three then entered a nearby caf\u00e9 to hang low for a while. Whilst at\nthe caf\u00e9, Ron and Hermione discussed the events of the wedding and Voldemort's coup. They unwittingly broke the Taboo that had been placed on Voldemort's name when the Death Eaters overthrew the Ministry of Magic, alerting Death Eaters Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle to their location. After a brief skirmish, the trio defeated the Death Eaters, whose memories Hermione wiped at Harry's suggestion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione then found refuge at 12 Grimmauld Place.  Harry labelled as \"Undesirable No. 1\" by the Ministry Having found no leads regarding the Horcruxes over the summer, Harry discovered R.A.B. during the trio's first morning at 12 Grimmauld Place. Once Hermione remembered that the locket had been in the house during its occupation by the Order of the Phoenix, Harry summoned Kreacher, and they learned that it had been stolen by Mundungus Fletcher. When the trio questioned him about it, he revealed that it was now in the possession of Dolores Umbridge. On the same day, Remus Lupin had been to visit. He asked Harry if he could join them, but once Harry found out that Tonks was pregnant, he refused. This caused a temporary rift between the two of them.  For the following month, the trio would take turns under the Invisibility Cloak to watch the Ministry entrance. On 2 September after formulating their plans, they managed to infiltrate the Ministry. Using Polyjuice Potion Harry transformed into Albert Runcorn. Once inside the Ministry it became apparent that the trio did not plan well enough, as they focused all their attention on how to get in and not what they were going to do once inside. Harry searched Umbridge's office but did not find the locket. He did, however, take Moody's eye from her door. Finding Umbridge trying Muggle-borns for \"stealing\" magic, Hermione managed to trick Umbridge into revealing the locket, and she lied about how she obtained it.  Harry casting his stag Patronus at Dementors, right before capturing Slytherin's locket Furious, Harry stunned both her and Yaxley. He and Hermione freed the Muggle-borns who were being held by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and Hermione conjured a copy of the locket while they took the real thing. They met up with Ron again and escaped, though Yaxley grabbed Hermione's arm while they were Disapparating. She evaded him with a Revulsion Jinx, but the location of 12 Grimmauld Place was revealed to him, and they were forced to abandon it as a hide-out. But instead Hermione took them to the woods that were once the location of the Quidditch World Cup.", "PPL": 0.20099687576293945, "PPL/lower": 0.24621044994470398, "PPL/zlib": 5.5539341188985753e-05, "Min-5%": 3.8946954590432785, "Min-10%": 1.9948242466677637, "Min-20%": 1.003017322446076, "Min-30%": 0.6694398158516565, "Min-40%": 0.5028186180774142, "Min-50%": 0.4021437206089746, "Min-60%": 0.3350372981851417}, {"text": "umbledore often sympathised with Harry about the grief and loneliness caused by his parents's death, and would comfort him\nat times when he really needed it. He also firmly believed and emphasised many times that Harry's love for his parents, James and Lily, was the reason why he had a power stronger than Voldemort's.  Years after James and Dumbledore's deaths, the former's second grandson was named after the latter.[43]  Minerva McGonagall, his former head of house and teacher Minerva McGonagall was the Transfiguration Professor and also the Head of Gryffindor House, at the time James was a student. McGonagall was simultaneously fond of, and exasperated with James: she knew that he was a mischievous trouble-maker and often played cruel pranks on some of his school rivals (such as Severus Snape), but she also knew that he was a clever and talented wizard, and essentially a good person; overall, they had a good relationship, which presumably improved significantly after James cleaned up his act, and became worthy of being made Head Boy.[33]  Upon learning of James and Lily's deaths a few hours after they were murdered, McGonagall was devastated, and barely managed to keep her composure.[8] In her later years, she shared quite a close relationship with James's son, Harry.  The original Order of the Phoenix James did have a good relationship with most of the members of the Order of the Phoenix, during the First Wizarding War. He might have been friendly with some members, such as Elphias Doge and Alastor Moody, as they were all members during the first war and most likely fought in several battles together. It is possible that James had many other friendships during his time in the Order, but they were unknown; his most famous friendship being the one he shared with the Marauders. Most of the original members of the Order were killed during the Second Wizarding War; only a few of them managed to survive.

He was the Captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team and played as a Chaser.  Roger was born between 1 September 1977 and 31 August 1978[1] in Great Britain or Ireland. He had an older brother named Chester Davies who was also in Ravenclaw.[4]  He began attending Hogwarts on 1 September 1989[1] and was sorted into Ravenclaw house. He joined the Ravenclaw Quidditch team as a Chaser and eventually became their Captain.[3]  Roger at the Yule Ball with Fleur In 1994, Roger was Fleur Delacour's date at the Yule Ball. He was very taken with the part-Veela witch's beauty and charm. He was so mesmerised, in fact, that he was looking at her the whole time and did not notice what she was actually saying, as well as repeatedly missing his own mouth with his fork while trying to eat. After dancing for some time at the ball, Roger and Fleur left for the gardens, sneaking into the rose bushes for a romantic engagement.[5]  Roger and Cho Chang sitting next to each other in the Great Hall According to Cho Chang, Roger asked her to go out with him shortly after the death of Cedric Diggory in June of 1995. She refused, as she was interested in Harry Potter at the time, though she brought this incident up to Harry when they went on a date in 1996 at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, apparently to make him jealous.[6]  Davies with a girl in Madam Puddifoot's teashop Roger was also there with his own date for Valentine's Day; Harry watched them for clues as to what to do with Cho, whom he thought was eyeing Roger as if she wished she were with him instead. When Cho left the teashop in a dramatic and tearful fashion, Roger, along with the rest of the customers in the teashop, looked at Harry, who was left behind.[6]  Fleur Delacour, his Yule Ball date who he was smitten with During 1994, Davies attended the Yule Ball as Fleur's partner. He was apparently too smitten by her part-Veela magic to actually take\nnote of anything she said, most of which was criticism of Hogwarts, while constantly missing his own mouth with the fork during dinner. The two apparently enjoyed their time together, as they had a romantic night within the bushes during the later parts of the Ball.[5] However, they did not keep in contact after the Triwizard Tournament ended, and Fleur later married Bill Weasley.[7]  Cho Chang, his ex-girlfriend Sometime after Cedric Diggory's death, Roger asked Cho out, to which she refused, being interested in Harry Potter at the time. Cho would later use this event to gauge Harry's feelings for her based on the jealousy he would produce, though he was only confused. Cho also watched Roger and his girlfriend holding hands and kissing over their sugar bowl in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, as though they were setting a standard that she expected Harry to live up to. Roger and his girlfriend stopped kissing to look at Harry in astonishment when Cho departed dramatically after an argument.[6]  Roger got himself a girlfriend sometime before 1996's Valentine's day, and the two seemed to be passionate with their relationship, as they were holding hands and kissing frequently over their sugar bowl inside Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop.[6]  Roger means \"famous spear\" from the Germanic elements hrod \"fame\" and ger \"spear\". The Normans brought this name to England, where it replaced the Old English cognate Hro\u00f0gar (the name of the Danish king in the Anglo-Saxon epic 'Beowulf'). It was a common name in England during the Middle Ages.\nAt least some content in this article is derived from information featured in: Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells\u00a0& Harry Potter: Magic Awakened.As such, spoilers will be present within the article.

And it had been for this reason that Jacob had taken the blame for the very potion that The Cabal had forced Duncan Ashe to make, as he feared that they would go after his family had he tried to expose them.[66]  Even though Dumbledore was fully prepared to take the mitigating circumstances of Jacob's transgressions into account going forward, any decision the Headmaster might have meant to make about revoking Jacob's expulsion or help to fight The Cabal ultimately became rather inappreciable when Jacob went mysteriously missing shortly thereafter.[68] With Jacob gone and unable to protect his kin, and given the possibility that The Cabal - whose members were still unknown and very much at large - might make good on their threats had he began to move against them prematurely, Dumbledore kept most of his findings to himself. As such, there were only three people who knew the full story once the dust had\nsettled: Jacob, Duncan Ashe, and the Headmaster himself.[66] Certain that Hogwarts had not seen the last of The Cabal, however, he tasked his old friend, veteran Auror and brother-in-arms in the Order of the Phoenix, Alastor Moody, with investigating The Cabal, who henceforth monitored their activities off-the-books.[75][76][77]  Albus Dumbledore in 1981, at age 100, during the trial of Igor Karkaroff Still, the wizarding war raged beyond the walls of Hogwarts: Shortly before the Potters' deaths, Dumbledore discovered that James's Cloak of Invisibility was, in fact, one of the Deathly Hallows. Although Dumbledore had long given up his desire to unite the Hallows and become Master of Death, he could not resist the thought of studying the Cloak. To that end, he borrowed it from James while James and Lily were in hiding. Later, Severus Snape approached Dumbledore, having already told Voldemort about the Prophecy. Snape was shocked by the fact that Voldemort had concluded that the prophecy was about Harry Potter, the son of James Potter, and Snape's own beloved childhood friend, Lily Evans. Dumbledore agreed, on the basis that Snape worked as a double agent for the Order. Dumbledore made arrangements to ensure the safety of the three; he advised them to stay hidden in their house in Godric's Hollow, which was protected by a Fidelius Charm. However, their Secret-Keeper (believed by Dumbledore and everyone else to be Sirius Black, but was in truth Peter Pettigrew) betrayed them, resulting in James and Lily's deaths at Voldemort's hands. However, as Voldemort attempted to murder Harry the curse backfired due to the protection provided by Lily Potter's love for her son and destroyed his body. This unfortunate occurrence provided Dumbledore with ownership of two of the Hallows, having already confirmed James's old cloak was indeed the one of legend.  Albus Dumbledore delivering Harry Potter with Minerva McGonagall Presumably well aware that Lord Voldemort wasn't truly vanquished, Dumbledore made sure that Harry would be kept safe with his family, the Dursleys, despite them not being selected as his guardians in the event of James and Lily's death, as his spells ensured that Voldemort could not harm Harry there as long as he could have a home with those with whom he was related by blood. He convinced Snape to help him protect Harry, although years later Dumbledore secretly planned to allow Voldemort to kill Harry in the end, which would destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul inside Harry. However, he also hoped to influence Harry into such a person who would willingly sacrifice his life for the greater good, allowing him the chance to choose between life and death in the end, guessing correctly the significance of such an act. Shortly thereafter, Dumbledore gave Snape employment at Hogwarts as the Potions master, and later defended Snape against the Ministry of Magic, who were rounding up and arresting remaining Death Eaters. Dumbledore attended many Death Eater trials, including that of the Lestranges and Barty Crouch Jnr. He was also a witness to Igor Karkaroff's testimony which secured his release from Azkaban in return\nfor the names of fellow Death Eaters. With Harry safe and certain members of the Order of the Phoenix and allies of their cause keeping watch over him and reporting back to Dumbledore, he continued his work as the brilliant if eccentric Headmaster of his beloved school.  Dumbledore at the Sorting Ceremony of 1984 At the Start-of-Term Feast during the 1984\u20131985 school year, Professor Dumbledore witnessed the Sorting ceremony of first-year students, including Charlie Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks, and Jacob's younger sibling, after which he stood behind the Owl Lecturn and gave a traditional welcoming speech. In his speech, he mentioned how Harry Potter was safe and would himself attend Hogwarts when old enough, along with House points and the yearly House Cup.[64]  At some point during the school year, Dumbledore was informed by Professor Severus Snape about cursed ice resurfacing in Hogwarts Castle,[72] and a Locked Room which possibly contained the source of it.[78]  After Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde duelled in the Courtyard without permission or supervision, Dumbledore introduced the students to the Hogwarts Duelling Club in the Dungeons, where duelling could be practised safely. He made certain to impress on the students how the destruction caused by these duels was left there so other students who wanted to duel could see how dangerous duelling could be, and consider the implications of casting unfriendly spells.[79]  Dumbledore checking up on Jacob's sibling Before this year's Hallowe'en Feast, several students volunteered to help Dumbledore with decorations, such as the carving of jack-o'-lanterns and crafting hats for a troupe of dancing skeletons.[80] Near the end of the feast, however, the school was under attack by a pack of werewolves, and after Dumbledore successfully removed five that had almost overran Hagrid's Hut, he came back to the Training Grounds in time to save Jacob's sibling and another unconscious student from three more, including Fenrir Greyback, who caught the scent of Dumbledore and left. The Headmaster examined the unconscious student, who was Chiara Lobosca, and concluded that she had not been bitten. He then informed the Ministry of Magic about the incident, and as a result, Cecil Lee was sent to investigate.[81]  A month later, the castle was under another attack by Greyback's army, during which Chiara fought as a werewolf to protect Jacob's sibling. The Headmaster came to know this identity of Chiara, and extended her the same offer he had done Remus Lupin years before. When this whole incident was over, Dumbledore held another Hallowe'en Feast to finish what had been left out.[81]  Dumbledore attending Hagrid's birthday celebration Before Rubeus Hagrid's birthday, Dumbledore decided to throw him a surprise birthday party. He first contacted Jacob's sibling, who was already a friend of Hagrid, and then went to find Amos Diggory, who agreed to drop by the castle with a selection of magical creatures for them to pick from as a birthday gift. In order to distract Hagrid, Dumbledore asked him to meet at the Training Grounds and help take care of some \"urgent business\" in Hogsmeade, while Jacob's\nsibling stayed behind and babysat Fang. When they returned, Dumbledore instructed Jacob's sibling to invite Professor Snape next, even if they had to bribe him with a gift. The birthday party was held as scheduled and turned out to be a huge success.[82]  Around Christmas, students continued to help Dumbledore with festive decorations. This tradition would be continued for the following few years.[83]  When Dumbledore found out Jacob's sibling and their friends had broken into", "PPL": 0.23681068420410156, "PPL/lower": 0.35761226621565606, "PPL/zlib": 6.498646657631767e-05, "Min-5%": 4.563365441619181, "Min-10%": 2.3611668826756524, "Min-20%": 1.1832773035476416, "Min-30%": 0.7890490575474368, "Min-40%": 0.5924857354809446, "Min-50%": 0.47382104473327863, "Min-60%": 0.3947402921789248}, {"text": "done her job and she scooped the fire into a jar. Suddenly, up in the air, the spell on Harry's broomstick was broken and he was\nonce again able to control his broom. The spectators watched in confusion as Harry dove towards the ground, only to clasp his hand to his mouth as if he was being violently sick the instant he landed. In actuality, Harry had caught the Snitch in his mouth. His capture of the Snitch ended the match, resulting in Gryffindor's victory.  The trio searching for information on Flamel in the Hogwarts Library After the match, Hagrid took the three back to his hut. Ron and Hermione told Harry and Hagrid about what was happening on the other side of the stands, and how Snape was cursing his broomstick. Hagrid, however, did not believe them, asking why Snape would try to kill Harry; Harry told Hagrid about Snape being bitten by the dog in the third-floor corridor. Surprised by their knowledge, Hagrid involuntarily revealed that the dog belonged to him, and that what the dog was guarding did not concern them, as it was a secret known only to Albus Dumbledore and a man named Nicolas Flamel.  Impressed as they were with the fact that Harry had managed to hold onto a bucking broomstick, Malfoy soon found that the rest of the school no longer found his taunts that Harry was to be replaced amusing, and so reverted to teasing Harry about having to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. Harry, however, was looking forward to spending Christmas away from the Dursleys, especially in light of the fact that Ron was also staying at Hogwarts, but also because it would give them some time to look up Nicolas Flamel; they were certain that the librarian would be able to find a book on Flamel in an instant, but were worried that it might be suspicious, and were thus forced to search for themselves.  Harry receiving his father's Cloak of Invisibility as a Christmas gift On Christmas day, Harry and Ron awoke to a pile of presents, each at the foot of their beds. At the bottom of the pile, he found a package containing an Invisibility Cloak and an anonymous note telling him only that the cloak once belonged to his father, and to \"use it well\". That night, Harry thought on the Cloak and decided to try it out. Realising he could go anywhere, he snuck back to the library and headed straight for the Restricted Section. Knowing he had to start somewhere, Harry pulled down one of the heavier books, and let it fall open on his knee. To his shock and horror, the silence was rent by a blood-curdling scream that issued from the book in front of him. He stuffed the book back in its place and ran for the door, knocking over the lantern he brought with him in his haste. Ducking under Filch's outstretched arms, Harry ran down the dark corridors, away from the library, and away from Filch.  Thinking he had escaped, Harry was scared to hear Filch's voice approaching, and horrified when he realised whom Filch was talking to: Snape. As Snape and\nFilch rounded the corner, Harry realised that although his father's cloak made him invisible, it did not stop him from being solid, and that he had no chance of sneaking past them, as the corridor was particularly narrow. Thinking quickly, (and panicking slightly), Harry noticed a door to his left; slipping inside, he found himself in an abandoned classroom. After Filch and Snape passed his hiding place, Harry relaxed and took in more details about the room he was in.  Harry standing in front of the Mirror of Erised In doing so, he noticed something he had missed the first time: an old, gilded mirror bearing the inscription \u201cErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi\u201d. Stepping in front of the mirror, Harry very nearly cried out in shock: inside the mirror he saw a large crowd of people standing behind him. Shocked, Harry turned around to look at the room, but saw no one there. Turning back to the mirror and looking more closely, Harry realised that the man and woman in the front looked oddly like him. The man looked just like him, from his untidy hair to his glasses, and the woman, Harry saw, had the same eyes he had. Understanding, Harry focused on other members of the crowd, and saw others who had his untidy hair, his eyes, and even an old man who had Harry's knees; Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.  The next night, Harry brought Ron with him to the mirror room. Ron did not see Harry's family in the mirror, but instead saw himself standing alone, tall, holding the House Cup, wearing badges indicating he was Head Boy and Quidditch Captain. The two began arguing over who would be allowed to look in the mirror; Mrs Norris, Filch's prowling cat, entered the room, attracted by the sounds of their argument. The next day, Ron, worried about being caught and about his friend's obsession with the mirror, warned Harry not to return; Harry, however, was not to be dissuaded.  Dumbledore advising Harry from seeking out the mirror again Going to the room that evening, Harry was ready to stay there all night, staring at the family he lost. However, in his haste, he failed to notice Professor Dumbledore standing by the door until after he removed his cloak. Dumbledore, who had been waiting for Harry, explained that the mirror, which was known as the \u201cMirror of Erised\u201d, displayed the deepest, most desperate desire of whoever looked into it. Harry, who had never known his family, saw them standing around him; Ron, ever overshadowed by his older brothers, saw himself standing alone, the best of them all.  Before sending Harry back to bed, however, Dumbledore warned him that the mirror was a dangerous object; men had been driven mad by what they saw in the mirror, not knowing if what they saw was real, or even possible. He told Harry that the mirror was to be moved to a new location, and warned Harry\nto not go looking for it. Before he left, Harry asked the headmaster what he saw in the mirror. Much to his surprise, Dumbledore told Harry that he saw himself with a pair of woollen socks. Despite his promise to Dumbledore, Harry found it difficult to forget the image of his parents, until Wood told the team that Snape would be refereeing the next Quidditch match against Hufflepuff.  Harry cheering Neville up after the latter was bullied by Draco Malfoy Shortly before the match, Malfoy, ever eager to pick on Neville, used the Leg-Locker Curse on Neville, forcing him to bunny hop his way back to the Common Room. Harry told Neville he was \"worth twelve of Malfoy\" and gave him a Chocolate Frog. Thanking Harry, Neville handed the card back to Harry for his collection. Looking down, Harry noted it was Dumbledore's card, the first he ever got. He turned the card over and suddenly remembered where he read the name Nicolas Flamel before: on the train on the way to school.  As the Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff Quidditch match drew nearer, tensions mounted in the school; Gryffindor had failed to overtake Slytherin in the Inter-House Quidditch Cup for seven years, and Harry was worried that it would be impossible with Snape as a referee. Unknown to Harry, Ron and Hermione had been practising the Leg-Locker Curse to use on Snape, should he show any signs of wanting to harm Harry. Before the match began, Wood took Harry aside and reminded him that he needed to catch the Snitch as soon as he could, before Snape could favour Hufflepuff too much. Harry performed his role as Seeker phenomenally, catching the Snitch within five minutes of the game starting, putting Gryffindor in first place for the Quidditch Cup.  The trio watching a dragon egg hatch while in Hagrid's Hut Having realised how much Harry, Ron, and Hermione had worked out about the Stone after running into them in the library, Rubeus Hagrid told them to meet him in his hut later. When the trio arrived later, they noticed that the fire was lit, despite the heat of the day. Although he was reluctant to answer their questions, Hermione managed to manipulate him into talking about the various protections used to guard it: Fluffy, the three headed dog, was Hagrid's, along with enchantments from Professors Sprout, Flitwick, McGonagall, Quirrell, and Snape.

Managing to appease Harry, he began explaining the meaning of his connection with Voldemort and asserting the meaning of the prophecy. Before the end of the year, he also had the Inquisitorial Squad disbanded and reverted any damage they did.[62]  Dumbledore trying on Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, activating a nasty curse During the summer of 1996, Dumbledore tracked one of Voldemort's Horcruxes to the house of the Gaunts. Dumbledore journeyed to Little Hangleton, where he found the remains of the shack hidden behind weeds and bush. Voldemort had placed many powerful enchantments around the former home of his ancestors;\nhowever, Dumbledore proved skilful enough to pass through them unharmed. When he found the Horcrux, a ring formerly owned by Marvolo Gaunt, he saw that the stone in the ring was one of the Deathly Hallows, the Resurrection Stone.[46]  This stone, according to legend, had the power to revive the dead (but in reality, a spiritual form of the person was brought back instead, much like an echo). His desire to see his family overrode his common sense for just a moment and he placed the ring on his finger, forgetting that the ring had been cursed by Voldemort. The curse quickly spread, and were it not for his own prodigious talents, he would have died within moments. Despite this injury, Dumbledore proceeded to destroy the ring, and with it, a piece of Voldemort's soul, bringing Voldemort that much closer to defeat.[46]  Snape's skills managing to trap the curse on the ring in Dumbledore's hand Dumbledore quickly returned to Hogwarts, where the skills of Severus Snape managed to trap the curse in Dumbledore's hand. However, both Snape and Dumbledore knew that it would eventually spread to the rest of his body. Knowing that the curse would kill him, Dumbledore asked Snape, that when the time came, that he be the one to end Dumbledore's life, rather than Draco Malfoy. Malfoy had been given the task of assassinating the headmaster, in order to spare Draco's soul from being torn Snape had to be the one to do it. Snape later objected to the plan but was reminded by Dumbledore that it was the only way to spare him from great suffering. During this time, Dumbledore also shared his insights on Voldemort with Harry by showing him the various memories he had collected, giving Harry a greater knowledge of Voldemort's psychology that would help him in his future conflicts.[46]  Harry and Dumbledore discussing memories of Tom Riddle Throughout the 1996\u20131997 school year, Dumbledore passed on certain pieces of information to Harry Potter that would be important for the boy in his quest to destroy the Dark Lord. Dumbledore held private lessons with Harry, revealing in them much of what he had learnt about Voldemort's past, life and Horcruxes. Dumbledore revealed to Harry that he made it his business to try and find out about Lord Voldemort's past. He did this by questioning people who had known him as a child and a teenager and obtained Voldemort-related memories from them.[46]  He collected memories from Bob Ogden, Morfin Gaunt, Horace Slughorn, and the house-elf Hokey. Using these memories, along with some of his own, he discovered that Voldemort had created six Horcruxes, an unheard-of event, been guilty of murders that he framed others for, and also figured out what the Horcruxes could be based on Voldemort's ego and his long interest in Hogwarts: Tom Riddle's Diary, Gaunt's Ring, Hufflepuff's Cup, Slytherin's Locket, Nagini, and an object of Rowena Ravenclaw's (later revealed to be her lost diadem). They dismissed the idea of a Gryffindor artefact as unlikely as only the Sorting Hat and\nthe Sword of Gryffindor remained as items from Gryffindor himself and Voldemort did not have access to them.[46]  Dumbledore and Harry Potter in the Crystal Cave After much searching, Dumbledore eventually tracked another of Voldemort's Horcruxes to a cave that as a young orphan, he had once visited. As he had promised, Dumbledore allowed Harry Potter to accompany him to the cave and help destroy the Horcrux. Setting off from Hogwarts on an evening in late June 1997,[6] he and Harry Apparated to just outside the cave, being unable to enter directly due to its protective enchantments. Once inside, Dumbledore located the Horcrux's second line of defence; a hidden doorway which only opened when it received an offering of blood.[46]  They next found themselves in a vast chamber containing an underground lake, with a solitary island at its centre from which a faint green light was visible. After a failed attempt by Harry at Summoning the Horcrux, Dumbledore located a carefully concealed boat that would allow them safe passage across the lake. During the crossing, Harry learned of the Horcrux's third line of defence; the lake was filled with Inferi, which would attack anyone who touched the lake's water. Dumbledore instructed Harry on the use of fire as the weapon of choice against the Inferi, should it become necessary.[46]  Arriving at the small island, they found a basin filled with glowing green potion. This last defence could not be removed by Vanishing it or scooping it out; someone would have to drink it to get to the Horcrux that lay within. Dumbledore ordered Harry to help him drink all of the potion, no matter what effects it caused, even if Harry had to force it down Dumbledore's throat.[46]  Dumbledore preparing to drink the Emerald Potion Dumbledore drank and he saw a vision of the duel between him, Gellert Grindelwald and Aberforth Dumbledore and Ariana's death. The drink also was weakening him and made him extremely thirsty as well and caused him great pain (the whole purpose of the potion). He couldn't bear it, but Harry succeeded at getting it down his throat by telling him it would be over soon. On his last drink he fell unconscious. After a failed attempt by Harry to revive him with Rennervate, Dumbledore woke up after his period of unconsciousness wanting water.[46]  Albus creating a fire storm to ward off the attacking Inferi Harry then attempted to summon water for Dumbledore with the Water-Making Spell, but this proved ineffective as the cavern was enchanted to vanish summoned water. In desperation, Harry filled a cup with water from the lake. Harry was only able to tip the water over Dumbledore's face before the Inferi climbed up out of the lake and attacked them. Harry panicked and attempted to fight back with a multitude of spells and curses, including the Impediment Jinx and Sectumsempra curse, but none of them worked since the Inferi were too numerous and had no blood to spill. Dumbledore, having regained consciousness, created a ring of fire around them\nthat repelled the Inferi, driving them back into the lake while he and Harry escaped in the boat with the Horcrux. Harry used a small cut on his arm to reopen the hidden doorway, and once outside the cave they Disapparated back to Hogsmeade.[46]  They would find no rest there, however, as the Battle of the Astronomy Tower had already begun. Harry and Dumbledore took brooms from behind Madam Rosmerta's bar and flew to the Astronomy Tower. Once at the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore and an invisibility-cloaked Harry were confronted by Draco Malfoy. Before Harry could reveal himself, Dumbledore immobilised him with a silent Full Body-Bind Curse, making it so he could only watch the upcoming event.[46]  Dumbledore being disarmed by Malfoy Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore, and admitted that he, Draco, was behind the series of attacks on Hogwarts students, and that Voldemort had ordered him to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore revealed that he knew of Draco's mission and of the attempts on his life with the Opal Necklace and poisoned mead but allowed him to remain in Hogwarts for knowing Voldemort would kill him", "PPL": 0.10728318244218826, "PPL/lower": 0.18746267490070248, "PPL/zlib": 3.127789575574002e-05, "Min-5%": 2.1017996155309913, "Min-10%": 1.067169968134669, "Min-20%": 0.5354300931729103, "Min-30%": 0.35728293902040476, "Min-40%": 0.2683570688239738, "Min-50%": 0.21464004800592643, "Min-60%": 0.17882603179013418}, {"text": "at the news of Lupin's son, Ted Lupin, being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage. Hermione was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' deaths in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, Teddy Lupin, later on in life.  Minerva McGonagall, her Head of House and professor Professor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in her house one of her \"rare smiles\" when Hermione successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for Hermione, and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the troll that entered the school in 1991 on her own, in order to cover up for Harry and Ron. Whenever Hermione and her friends would get into trouble, McGonagall almost inevitably looked to Hermione to be the most sensible one.[3]  McGonagall was noticeably upset when Hermione was Petrified in 1993, even granting Harry and Ron permission to skip a class so they could visit Hermione in the hospital wing.[4] The following school year, she helped arrange for Hermione to\nbe granted a Time-Turner to take extra classes.[33] When the professor was injured with four Stunning Spells in 1996, Hermione was very upset and worried for her.[31] Hermione seemed to regard her head of house as a role model, while Professor McGonagall, in spite of her sternness, was obviously quite fond of Hermione and expected great things of her.  Later, after McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts and Hermione became a member of the Ministry of Magic, McGonagall granted her permission to use notes left to the Hogwarts Archives, written by Albus Dumbledore, in her re-translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, demonstrating McGonagall's trust in her former pupil.  Severus Snape, her professor Severus Snape was the Potions Master during most of Hermione's time at Hogwarts. He was also the Head of Slytherin House, and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own house, while being quick to criticise and deduct points from Gryffindor students. He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio, and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Harry and Ron for their poor to mediocre performances in his class. He could not do the same to Hermione, as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an \"insufferable know-it-all,\"[33] once even snidely insulting the size of Hermione's teeth.[34]  Despite his pre-existing dislike for Gryffindor,[10] Snape's treatment of Hermione likely had more to do with her close friendship with Harry. Despite this, Hermione was still seen to defend Snape on occasion when Harry and Ron blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in Hogwarts, like setting the troll in the dungeon and trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone in Harry's first year. In her fifth year she defended Snape while Ron expressed distrust of him, citing the number of times they were wrong about Snape wanting to harm them. After Dumbledore's death, she like many, believed that Snape was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone. It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of Snape's true motives and allegiance, but given her personality, it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor's cruelty, and even admire him for his bravery.  Dolores Umbridge, her former professor and enemy Dolores Umbridge was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor by the Ministry of Magic, in 1995. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the Black Quill, most notably when she forced Harry Potter to carve \"I must not tell lies\" into the back of his own hand. Umbridge was as obsessed with blood-status as the Death Eaters, and had a particular hatred of what she called \"half-breeds.\" Hermione, like most of the students and staff at Hogwarts, hated Umbridge. Hermione was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge's appointment at the magical school. In turn, Umbridge was not too fond of Hermione, who was not only Muggle-born, but was also probably far too perceptive for her\nliking, as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical defensive magical education.   When Umbridge planned to use Veritaserum and then the Cruciatus Curse on Harry, Hermione was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the Forbidden Forest and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a herd of offended centaurs.  Hermione next met Umbridge a second time at the Ministry of Magic in 1997, when Hermione was disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk through the usage of Polyjuice Potion. Umbridge was, at the time, interrogating \"Mudblood\" witches and wizards, prior to sending them to Azkaban. Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes which Umbridge had taken from Mundungus Fletcher and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the Selwyn family. Hermione replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her. The trio proceeded to free all the Muggle-Borns awaiting interrogation.  Suffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that Hermione detested and loathed in Wizarding society, including but not limited to racial prejudice, sadism, malicious misuse of power, authoritarianism, and pure-blood supremacy.  Septima Vector, her Arithmancy professor Hermione also had a good relationship with her Arithmancy Professor Septima Vector. Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness. However, Hermione said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at Hogwarts. She also never complained about Vector's strictness. During her third year, Hermione joined her class and used a time-turner to get to one of the lessons.[71] Then in her fourth year, Hermione and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term,[72] and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy.[73]  Rowling took Hermione's name from William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale,[74] saying that she wanted it to be unusual, since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it.[74] Rowling's knowledge and interest in Greek mythology may have also influenced her choice in regards to Hermione's name. In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying classics entitled \"What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled\"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[75] The name \"Hermione\" is derived from \"Hermes\", who was the messenger of the Greek gods, as well as the god of wit, eloquence and quick thinking.  'Hermione' is the female derivative of 'Hermes', a messenger god known for his sharp wit and ability to transition between worlds. Quite fittingly, Hermione transitioned between the Muggle and wizarding worlds, delivered information, and was pretty sharp-witted herself.  Hermione in her sixth year Hermione is also the name of another figure from Greek mythology, who was the princess of Sparta and the only daughter of Helen of Troy and King Menelaus. The name also appears in Jean-Baptiste Lully's play Cadmus et Hermione, based on the story of the goddess of harmony, Harmonia, who married the founder of\nThebes.   In order to ensure that fans could correctly pronounce Hermione's name, a scene was created between Hermione and Viktor Krum in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which they discuss the correct pronunciation; however, the closest Krum got was \"Herm-own-ninny\".[76]  In the will of Albus Dumbledore, Hermione's middle name was listed as \"Jean\"; however, in previous interviews, Rowling had stated that her middle name was \"Jane\". Rowling cleared this up in a later interview", "PPL": 0.17037007212638855, "PPL/lower": 0.35690262365683234, "PPL/zlib": 4.7576116203962177e-05, "Min-5%": 3.3654944234911133, "Min-10%": 1.7019594099199145, "Min-20%": 0.851397383838555, "Min-30%": 0.5676601995288922, "Min-40%": 0.42625006268942023, "Min-50%": 0.34088178093171656, "Min-60%": 0.2839894762360625}, {"text": ", and Albus joined Ginny Potter, who had been in Patagonia since the start of the Cup, in her capacity of special Quidditch\ncorrespondent to the Daily Prophet.[108]  Harry along with his family (including Teddy Lupin) and Dumbledore's Army were granted access to the VIP section of the campsite. Harry embraced Viktor Krum, who was competing again after being retired for a few years, upon meeting him and introduced him to his sons, James and Albus.[109] He supported Bulgaria in the match together with the rest of his family (save for Albus) and looked \"emotional\" when Viktor Krum and his team had won the match. While at the game Harry also sported a nasty cut over his right cheekbone, which was a result of his top-secret work for the British Auror Office.  On 31 July 2014, Rita Skeeter launched a book at Flourish and Blotts titled Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of the Demob, regarding the lives of the members of Dumbledore's Army. The book according to Rita's description, seemed to focus on the D.A. members \"imperfections\". Harry and Ginny were featured on the front cover, Harry trying to hide their faces behind his hand. Rita also wrote a mostly fictionalised biography about Harry, with an unnamed title.  Harry with his family at King's Cross Station in 2017 escorting his sons to Platform 9\u00be On 1 September 2017, Harry and Ginny took their three children to King's Cross Station to see James and Albus off to Hogwarts. There, they met Ron and Hermione and their two children, Harry's niece Rose and nephew Hugo. When Albus expressed a fear that he might be Sorted into Slytherin House, Harry told his son that Albus was named after two Hogwarts Headmasters of whom one was a Slytherin and \"probably the bravest man [he] ever knew\". Harry assured him that his parents would be proud of him regardless of where he was Sorted. He also told him that the Sorting Hat would take his preferences into consideration, which happened to him when he was being Sorted. This was a secret he had never shared with his other children.  When Harry picked Albus up from King's Cross, who had returned from a year at Hogwarts, he was surprised to find Albus distant and colder. This distance was in direct response to the pressure Albus felt regarding Harry's legacy and the expectations that others put on him because of it. Albus and Scorpius Malfoy became fast friends during the year, as they were kindred spirits \u2014 they both carry a burden stemming from their family identity and feel that they are misfits and \"losers\" in comparison with the other students at Hogwarts. Harry did not like this and he questioned why Albus was content to have only the one friend. Their relationship would stay strained for the next couple of years to come.  Harry seeing James, Lily, and Rose off to Hogwarts, while Albus stood off to the side In September 2018, Harry took Albus to King's Cross again. He was hurt when Albus told him he wanted to be alone. This stemmed from all the pedestrians watching the two, Albus felt as though they were\nwatching the famous Harry Potter and \"his disappointing son\". Harry told him not to be bothered by people looking and thought his friendship with Scorpius Malfoy, the child of his rival, was the reason why Albus wanted nothing to do with him. Harry then demanded Albus sever their friendship, but his son refused.  In September 2019, Harry took Albus to King's Cross yet again where he gave Albus the permission slip he needed to visit Hogsmeade. Albus destroyed the slip by burning it, stating that he had no wish to go to Hogsmeade and left his father behind. This in turn caused Harry to become angry with him. Their father-son relationship continued to deteriorate, going from bad to worse.  By late summer of 2020, Harry had been made Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[110] After hearing a rumour about an illegal and very powerful Time-Turner, Harry and his team of Aurors raided the Nott residence and confiscated it. Harry defeated Nott in a duel and then arrested him. He was arrested for the illegal possession of an unregistered and advanced Time-Turner.[111]  Nott had created at least two Time-Turners for Lucius Malfoy, who was paying him for his services. The prototype, which was restricted by a boundary of five minutes, was seized by Potter and later used by his son to travel to the past. The improved Time-Turner, which gleamed gold and allowed the traveller to stay in the past for an unlimited time, was kept by Lucius who never used it.[4]  Harry turned the prototype Time-Turner over to Hermione (the Minister for Magic) for safekeeping. While in his paper laden workoffice, he and Hermione spoke about recent activity among Voldemort's former allies and how action must be taken. They discuess the \"mountain trolls riding Graphorns through Hungary, giants with winged tattoos on their backs walking through the Greek Seas, and the werewolves that have gone entirely underground\".[110]  Harry gifting Albus with his old baby blanket Harry was later visited at home by Amos Diggory, who had heard he might have the Time-Turner. Whom he supposedly learned this information from is unknown. While Albus and Delphi Diggory (who claimed to be Amos' carer and niece) listened in, Amos demanded Harry go back in time and save Cedric. Amos proceeded to tell Harry that Cedric was more then a spare and that he deserved a chance to life a full life. However, Harry refused due to the implications of intervening greatly with the past, as changing the past can have severe consequences on the future. This caused Amos to react negatively, calling Harry cold. Later that night Harry attempted to reconcile with Albus.  Harry's relationship with Albus had strained increasingly since he had left for Hogwarts. In an effort to mend things, Harry spoke to Albus and tried to give him the old baby blanket he received from his mother Lily. He did this in the hope a reminder of what happened would make him change his behaviour. This was a significant and sentimental gift on\nHarry's part, as it was the only physical piece of his mother that he had. When Albus rejected the gift, it led to an argument in which they both expressed the wish that they were not related. Harry regretted what he said, but it was too late to take it back.  Harry's awoken from a nightmare after his scar pains him for the first time in many years Harry began to experience nightmares and pains in his scar, something that he had not experienced since his final defeat of Voldemort. Ginny tried to comfort him and proceeded to ask what was wrong. When Harry explained, they decided to let Hermione know. Harry took his scar hurting to be an ominous sign and it left him with many worries concerning his son and the outcome of the future.  He and Hermione held a public meeting, but the community was not convinced there is a threat, as they were not willing to accept that danger was once again imminent. Draco accused Harry of only wanting his name in the papers and proceeded to storm out of the public meeting. Later on Harry, Ginny, and Draco then learnt that Albus and Scorpius were missing. This prompted Draco to start a duel with Harry, Ginny was quick to interrupt it, before it got out of hand. They had decided to retrieve the Time-Turner and help Amos save Cedric. Ginny concluded Albus ran away after his argument with Harry, and Draco was upset that Scorpius had been pulled into their family issues.  Albus and Scorpius's time-travelling antics created two separate alternate timelines. This was something that could have disastrous effects for everyone. In one, Harry received a dream revealing Albus's location in the Forbidden Forest. As he and the others searched, Harry came across the centaur Bane. Bane warned him that a \"dark cloud\" haunted Albus. He took this \"dark cloud\" to mean Scorpius and his doubts regarding his son's friendship with him strengthened even more. He, Ron, and Ginny found the boys just after they return from the past. Scorpius was uninjured, but Albus sustained a broken arm.  Harry conversing with the portrait of Albus Dumbledore Albus was brought to the school's hospital wing, where Harry conversed with a portrait of Albus Dumbledore.

It is known that they had died by the time Petunia had a son.  Lily Evans was Petunia's only sibling. When Lily's magical abilities began to manifest themselves, Petunia was torn between curiosity and disapproval. Their relationship became even more strained when Lily became friends with Severus Snape, the very peculiar boy next door.  When Lily was admitted to Hogwarts, Petunia secretly wrote to Professor Dumbledore begging him to let her attend as well. After being kindly rejected by him, Petunia began calling wizards and witches \"weirdos\" and denied the existence of her sister as much as possible. She would not admit it, but deep inside her, Petunia still cared for Lily, sending her sister a vase (however horrible in Lily's opinion) one Christmas and was in all probability devastated when her sister was murdered.  As James didn't have any living relatives, it was possibly Petunia who arranged the funeral for her sister and brother-in-law and had them buried in Godric's Hollow.  After being given Harry, Petunia kept Lily's blanket, in which he was wrapped, for the rest of her life as (aside from Harry) it was all of her sister she had left.[27]  Vernon Dursley, her husband Petunia met Vernon Dursley at work and married him sometime later.[6] She identified with his narrow-minded views and was proud of his position at work. She and Vernon ignored Harry as much as possible and excluded him from most of the family activities.  They were extremely vain, materialistic, and preoccupied with status. They gave Dudley everything he wanted, allowing him to rule the house. Conversely, they kept strict control over Harry; he performed the chores, cooked the meals (or at least breakfast), and spent time otherwise locked in the cupboard under the stairs. After Harry re-entered the wizarding world, Petunia and Vernon's control over him diminished.  It is unknown if Vernon knew that his wife wanted to attend Hogwarts herself in the past, about her previously close relationship with Lily, or her childhood with the wizard Severus Snape. Given the fact that Petunia had always wanted to appear 'normal', it is likely that she did not tell him.   Dudley Dursley, her son and only child Dudley was Petunia's only child. To say that Dudley was pampered and spoiled is an understatement. Petunia and her husband catered to Dudley's every whim and lavished affection on him while completely disregarding Harry. They praised Dudley excessively, despite the fact that he rarely worked hard or achieved anything noteworthy (except perhaps his considerable boxing abilities, but even that was essentially an extension of his aggressive, bullying nature). Petunia never acknowledged when her son was in the wrong and overlooked his many flaws. As a result of her indulging Dudley's gluttony, he grew up extremely obese. However, Petunia, was in complete denial about her son's size and said that it was just \"baby fat\".  Petunia was a poor parent because she cared more about indulging her son than teaching him how\nto be a good person and as a consequence, he grew up to be lazy, selfish and with no moral values. This fact came back to haunt Dudley when he encountered the dementors.  Harry Potter, her nephew Petunia never showed any love and affection at all towards Harry because he reminded her of Lily and the wizarding world, and Harry never showed any love or affection towards her either.[4] She treated him as a waste of space, often abusing him, giving him the cupboard under the stairs at first and making him do all the chores.[10] She, along with Vernon, ignored most of Harry's birthdays.[11][13]  She didn't accept Harry as a second son and never gave him love and affection. Harry in turn hated Petunia as well due to her cruel treatment towards him. She kept him entirely ignorant of the wizarding world and tried to make her family look as normal as possible, as part of her attempts to hide Harry from other people. When Harry left to search for Horcruxes in 1997, Petunia was almost able to bring herself to wish him luck and admit that her poor treatment of him was born out of jealousy, but backed out at the last moment and left without saying a word.[26]  During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry was privy to many memories of Severus Snape, after the latter's death at the fangs of Nagini, regarding his (Snape's) origins and loyalties. Many of the first memories that Harry had gazed upon depicted his future Aunt Petunia and unwittingly explained to him the reasons for her hatred of him and magic overall, such as: her falling out with his mother as children, Petunia's jealousy of Lily's magical abilities and her childhood enmity with Snape. However, Harry was more concerned about discovering Snape's loyalties and origins than he was about decrypting Petunia's hatred for him.  Petunia would later become an aunt-in-law to Harry's wife Ginevra Weasley and a great-aunt to Harry and Ginny's three children; James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Although Harry's relationship with Dudley had mended to the point that they remained on \"Christmas card terms\" and visited occasionally, it is unknown if Petunia herself ever had contact with Harry again. Despite Harry's hatred towards his aunt, he still cared for her enough to push them to go into hiding for their protection. Although it is not known if Petunia contacted Harry again after the war, it is highly possible that Petunia reconciled with her nephew and was on Christmas cards terms with him too. Given how Harry learned of what caused the rift between his mother and her sister, Harry gained a new understanding of his aunt. After her death, Dudley gave Harry his blanket which had been kept in the possession of Petunia since his arrival at Privet Drive.  Severus Snape, her childhood neighbour Petunia first met Severus Snape during their childhood. She was the sister of Lily Evans, but Petunia was a Muggle, unlike her sister. Snape and Petunia strongly disliked each other, from\nthe first moment they met. Petunia, who was contemptuous of anything out of the ordinary, viewed him with disdain because of his poor economic status and because he was such an oddball. Snape, on the other hand, regarded her balefully because she was a Muggle and also because she made disparaging comments about his clothes. Possibly as a result of this childhood animosity, the subject of Snape, as with anything magic-related, was never mentioned under the Dursley's roof until Dudley Dursley got attacked by dementors and he was indirectly mentioned by Petunia as \"that awful boy\" when talking about Dementors.  In an ironic twist, Snape and Petunia's negative encounters helped shape their respective adult personalities. Snape's interactions with Petunia likely helped reinforce his already growing disdain for the Muggle world, which caused him to dabble in Pure-blood supremacy and the Dark Arts during his teenage years and early adulthood. Likewise, Petunia's encounters with Snape likely hardened her heart towards anything and anyone related to the wizarding world. In a cruel sense of irony, Snape's interests in the Dark Arts indirectly caused the death of Petunia's sister Lily.   Albus Dumbledore It can be assumed that Aunt Petunia would not have gotten on well with Albus Dumbledore due to his \"unDursleyness\" and due the fact that he was as unusual as it is possible to be. It was also he who alerted Petunia to the death of her sister and abandoned Harry Potter on her doorstep shortly after, ignoring her feelings on the matter. After Vernon Dursley tried to throw Harry out after the attack on Dudley Dursley, Dumbledore sent Petunia an exploding, screaming letter (howler).  Not even a year later Dumbledore arrived at 4 Privet Drive uninvited telling them that they had to let Harry stay until his 17th birthday for their protection, giving them drinks that constantly hit them in the head. However, when Dumbledore reprehended the Dursleys for their cruel treatment of Harry, Petunia, instead of reacting with anger like her husband, was thought by", "PPL": 0.11450710147619247, "PPL/lower": 0.3304260961763332, "PPL/zlib": 3.3152027063170956e-05, "Min-5%": 2.2452569921665333, "Min-10%": 1.1415667010644706, "Min-20%": 0.5721350251554687, "Min-30%": 0.3815473305740802, "Min-40%": 0.28649425710517856, "Min-50%": 0.2291122323684174, "Min-60%": 0.19087273943881564}], "holdout": [{"text": "shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter.

With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\"\n\u3000\u3000The elf's ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry's sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue.

Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to\n\u3000\u3000tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was starting to grow on me.\"\n\u3000\u3000The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\n\u3000\u3000Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic.

For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\n\u3000\u3000It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\n\u3000\u3000The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:\n\u3000\u3000Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguises.\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he'd probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.\n\u3000\u3000The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the magic", "PPL": 1.6475958824157715, "PPL/lower": 0.7909135763358084, "PPL/zlib": 0.0004630679826913354, "Min-5%": 20.828786176793717, "Min-10%": 14.83857939523809, "Min-20%": 8.235026881317346, "Min-30%": 5.498629608224214, "Min-40%": 4.120894579527943, "Min-50%": 3.2951660449692004, "Min-60%": 2.747329741812837}, {"text": "to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugle git.\"\n\u3000\u3000It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious. And there was more....\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry closed his eyes in horror.

A large shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"You called, Severus?\" said Lupin mildly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I certainly did,\" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk. \"I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared on Lupin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" said Snape again. \"This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction, warned him not to interrupt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Full of Dark Magic?\" he repeated mildly. \"Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. \"You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?\" he said. \"Harry, do you know any of these men?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You see, Severus?\" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. \"It looks like a Zonko product to me --\"\n\u3000\u3000Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,\" he choked. \"Bought -- it... in Zonko's... ages -- ago...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well!\" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. \"That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back, shall I?\" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. \"Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor, I --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to hear explanations,\" said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. \"I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it' s a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. \"I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let you have it back, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because...,\" Lupin hesitated, \"because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you know them?\" said Harry, impressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've met,\" he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.\"\n\u3000\u3000He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in Snape's office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn't dare go and get it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my fault,\" said Ron abruptly. \"I persuaded you to go. Lupin's right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face convinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart plummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come to have a good gloat?\" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front of them. \"Or have you just been to tell on us?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling. \"I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his case.

The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.\n\u3000\u3000Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all the help you gave us.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head.

As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's gorgeous, isn't he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\n\u3000\u3000That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with that thing around?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages; no one wanted him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with A their shopping.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"They still haven't caught him, then?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They've pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It'd be good to get some more money --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back, You mark my words.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered \"hello\" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry. How nice to see you.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000I hope you're well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather like being introduced to the mayor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well, thanks --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. \"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy scowled.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's enough, now,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum!\" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her hand too. \"How really corking to see you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said, that's enough,\" said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in an empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting news?\" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest. \"Second Head Boy in the family!\" she said, swelling with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"And last,\" Fred muttered under his breath.\n\u3000\u3000I don't doubt that,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice they haven't made you two prefects.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do we want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at the very idea. \"It'd take all the fun out of life.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny giggled.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!\" snapped Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny's got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\" said Percy loftily. \"I'm going up to change for dinner...\"\n\u3000\u3000He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\n\u3000\u3000\"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted us.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\n\u3000\u3000\"How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone looked up at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there'll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\" Percy asked again, in a dignified voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, as we haven't got one anymore,\" said Mr. Weasley,\n\u3000\u3000\"-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr. Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he was under Pressure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thing, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \"Do you realize how much luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle Underground.... You are all packed, aren't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron hasn't put all his new things in his trunk yet,\" said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. \"He's dumped them on my bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time in the morning,\" Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.\n\u3000\u3000After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't touched it, all right?\" Ron roared back.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"My Head Boy badge is gone,\" said Percy, rounding on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So's Scabbers's rat tonic,\" said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk to look. \"I think I might've left it in the bar --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!\" yelled Percy.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed,\" Harry", "PPL": 5.282959938049316, "PPL/lower": 0.9790550474289618, "PPL/zlib": 0.0017158038122927302, "Min-5%": 31.62196725957534, "Min-10%": 26.33461471632415, "Min-20%": 20.006010179123262, "Min-30%": 15.902328856993188, "Min-40%": 12.926710076611899, "Min-50%": 10.557686027558201, "Min-60%": 8.805984247700351}, {"text": "s \nhead and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded \nbag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch\u2019s handbag. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s Mafalda Hopkirk,\u201d he said, reading a small card that identified their victim \nas an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \u201cYou\u2019d better take this, Hermione, \nand here are the tokens.\u201d \n\n He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., \nwhich he had taken from the witch\u2019s purse. \n\n Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, \nand within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed \nMafalda\u2019s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\u201d \n\n They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the \nInvisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds \nlater there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them. \n\n \u201cOh, hello, Mafalda.\u201d \n\n \u201cHello!\u201d said Hermione in a quavery voice, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d \n\n \u201cNot so good, actually,\u201d replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly \ndowncast. \n\n As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along \nbehind them. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re under the weather,\u201d said Hermione, talking firmly over \nthe little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him \nfrom reaching the street. \u201cHere, have a sweet.\u201d \n\n \u201cEh? Oh, no thanks \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI insist!\u201d said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. \nLooking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. \n\n The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the \nlittle wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a \nhandful of hairs from the top of his head. \n\n \u201cOh dear!\u201d she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better \ntake the day off!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no!\u201d He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being \nunable to walk straight. \u201cI must \u2013 today \u2013 must go \u2013 \u201c \n\n\f\n \u201cBut that\u2019s just silly!\u201d said Hermione, alarmed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to work in this state \n\u2013 I think you ought to go to St. Mungo\u2019s and get them to sort you out.\u201d \n\n The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the \nmain street. \n\n \u201cYou simply can\u2019t go to work like this!\u201d cried Hermione. \n\n At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to \nclaw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving \nnothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying \nchunks of vomit. \n\n \u201cUrgh,\u201d said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of \nsick. \u201cIt would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard\u2019s bag, \u201cbut I \nstill think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on \nhis job, though, isn\u2019t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\u201d \n\n Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick \nwizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. \n\n \u201cWeird he wasn\u2019t wearing them today, wasn\u2019t it, seeing how much he wanted to \ngo? Anyway, I\u2019m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\u201d \n\n \u201cNow wait here,\u201d Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \n\u201cand we\u2019ll be back with some hairs for you.\u201d \n\n He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in \nthe sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron \nand Hermione reappeared. \n\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black \nhairs, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he\u2019s pretty tall, you\u2019ll need \nbigger robes \u2026\u201d \n\n She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry \nretired to take the potion and change. \n\n Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, \nfrom what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a \nbeard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the \nother two. \n\n \u201cBlimey, that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. \n\n \u201cTake one of Mafalda\u2019s tokens,\u201d Hermione told Harry, \u201cand let\u2019s go, it\u2019s nearly \nnine.\u201d \n\n They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded \npavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled \nGENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. \n\n \u201cSee you in a moment, then,\u201d said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down \nthe steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending \ninto what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and \nwhite. \n\n \u201cMorning, Reg!\u201d called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a \ncubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \u201cBlooming pain in the bum, \nthis, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry \nPotter?\u201d \n\n\f\n The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cstupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. \n\n To Harry\u2019s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and \npeered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted \nfeet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. \n\n \u201cWe have to flush ourselves in?\u201d he whispered. \n\n \u201cLooks like it,\u201d Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. \n\n They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. \n\n He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be \nstanding in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the \nchain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into \nthe Ministry of Magic. \n\n He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. \nThe great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain \nhad filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished \nwooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was \nrather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved \nthrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. \nEngraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. \n\n Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs.

Something shifted in the shadows at \nthe end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up \nout of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. \nBlack, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, \n\n\f\nits waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty \neye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at \nHarry. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \n\u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t us! We didn\u2019t kill you \u2013\u201c \n\n On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes \nwatering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with \nher arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her \nclumsily on the shoulder and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all r-right. . . . It\u2019s g-gone. . . .\u201d \n\n Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black \ncontinued to scream. \n\n \u201cMudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a \nburst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. \n\n \u201cThat . . . that was . . . \u201c Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t really him, was it? Just something to scare \nSnape.\u201d \nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure \naside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the \nother two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved \nexcept for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. \n\n \u201cBefore we go any farther, I think we\u2019d better check,\u201d whispered Hermione, and \nshe raised her wand and said, \u201cHomenum revelio.\u201d \n\n Nothing happened. \n\n \u201cWell, you\u2019ve just had a big shock,\u201d said Ron kindly. \u201cWhat was that supposed to \ndo?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did what I meant it to do!\u201d said Hermione rather crossly. \u201cThat was a spell to \nreveal human presence, and there\u2019s nobody here except us!\u201d \n\u201cAnd old Dusty,\u201d said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-\nfigure had risen. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led \nthe way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. \n\n Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in \nthe drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her.

He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that \nwas not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. \n\n \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \u201cDid you see him at my \nplace?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2013 he\u2019s really angry \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut that could be at the Burrow,\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cWhat else?

I thought that connection had \nclosed!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt did, for a while,\u201d muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard \nto concentrate. \u201cI \u2013 I think it\u2019s started opening again whenever he loses control, that\u2019s \nhow it used to \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to close your mind!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \u201cHarry, \nDumbledore didn\u2019t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that\u2019s \nwhy you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images \nin your mind, remember \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cYeah, I do remember, thanks,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need \nHermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between \nthem to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius\u2019s death. He wished that he \nhad not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as \nthough he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was \nbuilding and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick. \n\n He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry \nof the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again \nand spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land \nupon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the \nvoice of Ron\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cFamily safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\u201d \n\n The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper \nand a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. \n\n \u201cThey\u2019re all right, they\u2019re all right!\u201d she whispered, and Ron half laughed and \nhugged her. \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d he said over Hermione\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s your \nfamily, \u2018course you were worried. I\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d He thought of Ginny. \u201cI do feel \nthe same way.\u201d \n\n The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had", "PPL": 6.729485034942627, "PPL/lower": 1.0201452024614894, "PPL/zlib": 0.002114860161829864, "Min-5%": 34.99847900166231, "Min-10%": 28.829235768785665, "Min-20%": 22.454228869860213, "Min-30%": 18.39166960265815, "Min-40%": 15.43268985270288, "Min-50%": 13.101658895684594, "Min-60%": 11.176748533590608}, {"text": "time \nthat had met, scraggy and grim. \n\n\"Sorry to intrude,\" said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \n\"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.\" \n\n \n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. \n\n\"Many happy returns.\" \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry. \n\n\"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald \nWeasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\" \n\n\"Us?\" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why us?\" \n\n\"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is \nthere such a place?' he demanded of Mr. Weasley. \n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, \nwhy don't you use that?\" \n\n\"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you \nto accompany us, Arthur.\" \n\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, \nand Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew \nthat the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had \nlearned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. \n\nScrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into \nthe Burrow's sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, \n\n\f\nit was already dark in here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they \nilluminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair \nthat Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side \nby side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. \n\n\"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it \nindividually. If you two\" -- he pointed at Harry and Hermione -- \"can wait upstairs, I will \nstart with Ronald.\" \n\n \n\n\"We're not going anywhere,\" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \n\"You can speak to us together, or not at all.\" \n\nScrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the \nMinister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. \n\n\"Very well then, together,\" he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \"I am here, \nas I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will.\" \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. \n\n\"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you \nanything?\" \n\n\"A-all of us?\" said Ron, \"Me and Hermione too?\" \n\n\"Yes, all of --\" \n\nBut Harry interrupted. \n\n\"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what \nhe left us?\" \n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted \nto examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and her voice \ntrembled slightly. \n\n\"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable \nConfiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will--\" \n\n\"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \n\"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions \nare illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was \ntrying to pass us something cursed?\" \n\n\"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\" asked \nScrimgeour. \n\n\"No, I'm not,\" retorted Hermione. \"I'm hoping to do some good in the world!\" \n\nRon laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry \nspoke. \n\n\"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext \nto keep them?\" \n\n\"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up,\" said Hermione at once. \"They can't \nkeep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?\" \n\n\"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\" asked Scrimgeour, \nignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled. \n\n\"Me? Not -- not really... It was always Harry who...\" \n\nRon looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-\ntalking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done; Scrimgeour looked as though he had \n\n\f\nheard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey \nupon Ron's answer. \n\n\"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that \nhe remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast \nmajority of his possessions -- his private library, his magical instruments, and other \npersonal effects -- were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\" \n\n\"I...dunno,\" said Ron. \"I...when I say we weren't close...I mean, I think he liked \nme...\" \n\n\"You're being modest, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Dumbledore was very fond of you.\" \n\nThis was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and \nDumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been \nnegligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his \ncloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. \nFrom it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. \n\n\"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... \nYes, here we are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that \nhe will remember me when he uses it.'\" \n\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked \nsomething like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light \nfrom a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed \nthe Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. \n\n\"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be \nunique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you and item \nso rare?\" \n\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered. \n\n\"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\" Scrimgeour persevered. \n\"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did \nhe think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\" \n\n\"Put out lights, I s'pose,\" mumbled Ron. \"What else could I do with it?\" \n\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or \ntow, he turned back to Dumbledore's will. \n\n\"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the \nBard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'\" \n\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the \ncopy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. \nHermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and \ngazed at it.

Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock.\n\u3000\u3000\"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this.... He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame werewolf --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w -- would it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll come quietly....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\"\n\u3000\u3000What little color there was in Blacks face left it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\n\u3000\u3000Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You should have left him to me....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please.

Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes!\" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me!

Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"An unworthy trick!\" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\"\n\u3000\u3000If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Harry!\" said George, fighting his way over. \"Party! Gryffindor common room, now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did you do that?\" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" Fred muttered in Harry's ear.\n\u3000\u3000Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you even come to the match?\" he asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. \"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!\" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway...\" She glanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn't want me to join in.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can't you give her a break?\" Harry asked Ron quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep....\n\u3000\u3000He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and -\n\u3000\u3000\"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of the room: \"What's going on?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at the curtains!

Boys, too, were reappearing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent, are we carrying on?\" said Fred Weasley brightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone back upstairs!\" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\n\u3000\u3000\"Perce -- Sirius Black!\" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory!

Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood wasn't pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - \"\n\u3000\u3000*108*\n\u3000\u3000Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.\n\u3000\u3000Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\n\u3000\u3000\"So this year, we train harder than ever before .... Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stifflegged and still yawning, his team followed.\n\u3000\u3000They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood's been teaching us new moves.\"\n\u3000\u3000He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\n\u3000\u3000*io9*\n\u3000\u3000\"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because they're here in person,\" said George, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We'll see about this!\"\n\u3000\u3000Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\"\n\u3000\u3000Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\"\n\u3000\u3000*110*\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.\"'\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\"\n\u3000\u3000And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.\n\u3000\u3000\"Funny you should mention Draco's father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he's made to the Slytherin team.\"\n\u3000\u3000All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors' noses in the early morning sun.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - \"sweeps the board with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n\u3000\u3000*111*\n\u3000\u3000\"What's happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren't you playing? And what's he doing here?\"\n\u3000\u3000He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone's just been admiring the brooms my father's bought our team.\n\u3000\u3000Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\"\n\u3000\u3000The smug look on Malfoy's face flickered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one asked your opinion, you fiIthy little Mudblood,\" he spat.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" ; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint's arm at Malfoys face.\n\u3000\u3000A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron's wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.\n\u3000\u300012\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!

Presents!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.\n\u3000\u3000'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it,\" he said hoarsely.\n\u3000\u3000It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who sent it to you?\" said Ron in a hushed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look and see if there's a card,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, feeling stunned, \"I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys.\"\n\u3000\u3000I bet it was Dumbledore,\" said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \"He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That was my dad's, though,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was just Passing it on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go giving students stuff like this --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!\" said Ron. \"In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry\" -- Ron gave a great whoop of laughter -- \"Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe this,\" Harry muttered, running a hand along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. \"Who -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know,\" said Ron, controlling himself, \"I know who it could've been -- Lupin!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself \"Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but he likes you,\" said Ron. \"And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, he was away?\" said Harry. \"He was ill when I was playing in that match.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't see Lupin affording something like this.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you two laughing about?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't bring him in here!\" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn't a card or anything with it.\"\n\u3000\u3000To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter with you?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron sighed exasperatedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the best broom there is, Hermione,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"So it must've been really expensive....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,\" said Ron happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they'd sent it?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione shrilly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed, right at Ron's chest.\n\u3000\u3000\"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!\" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.\n\u3000\u3000Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.\n\u3000\u3000I forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\n\u3000\u3000The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry's bed nursing his toe. \"Can't you shut that thing up?\" he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too\n\u3000\u3000\"He's not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's stress!\" said Ron. \"He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers died.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor common room that morning.

He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn't need them - he took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle's low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\n\u3000\u3000Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.

Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\"\n\u3000\u3000He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\n\u3000\u3000* 220 *\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the new password again?\" he said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, yeah -pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.\n\u3000\u3000The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I'll go and get it my", "PPL": 0.12174450606107712, "PPL/lower": 0.17371127929240257, "PPL/zlib": 3.8883585455470175e-05, "Min-5%": 2.4072544758810714, "Min-10%": 1.21643011694701, "Min-20%": 0.6086542053267128, "Min-30%": 0.40573143636343656, "Min-40%": 0.3046198010983916, "Min-50%": 0.24359750388965284, "Min-60%": 0.20293789994686853}, {"text": "ville was saying or the \nmatter-of-fact tone in which he said them. \n\n \u201cThe only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the \noutside are giving trouble.

We used to sneak out at night \nand put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore\u2019s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that.

The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming \ndown on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year \nthey\u2019d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo kidding,\u201d muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, I couldn\u2019t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped \nthose kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a \ncouple of weeks ago. That\u2019s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I \nsuppose, and they went for Gran.\u201d \n\n \u201cThey what?\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so \nsteeply, \u201cwell, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to \nforce their relatives to behave. I s\u2019pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the \nother way around. Thing was,\u201d he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he \nwas grinning, \u201cthey bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch \nliving alone, they probably thought hey didn\u2019t need to send anyone particularly powerful. \nAnyway,\u201d Neville laughed, \u201cDawlish is still in St. Mungo\u2019s and Gran\u2019s on the run.

We\u2019re here.\u201d \n\n They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another \nshort flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\u2019s portrait. Neville \npushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for \nunseen people: \n\n \u201cLook who it is! Didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d \n\n As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams \nand yells: \u201cHARRY!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Potter, it\u2019s POTTER!\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d \n\n\f\n He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The \nnext moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their \nhair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They \nmight have just won a Quidditch final. \n\n \u201cOkay, okay, calm down!\u201d Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry \nwas able to take in their surroundings. \n\n He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the \ninterior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\u2019s cabin. \nMulticolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran \naround the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright \ntapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black \nbadger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. \nThe silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few \nbroomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-cased wireless. \n\n \u201cWhere are we?\u201d \n\n \u201cRoom of Requirement, of course!\u201d said Neville. \u201cSurpassed itself, hasn\u2019t it? The \nCarrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to \nget through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly like this when I \narrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. \nBut it\u2019s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd the Carrows can\u2019t get in?\u201d asked Harry, looking around for the door. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: \nSeamus\u2019s face was bruised and puffy. \u201cIt\u2019s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in \nhere, they can\u2019t get at us, the door won\u2019t open. It\u2019s all down to Neville. He really gets this \nroom. You\u2019ve got to ask for exactly what you need \u2013 like, \u201cI don\u2019t want any Carrow \nsupporters to be able to get in\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019ll do it for you! You\u2019ve just got to make sure you \nclose the loopholes. Neville\u2019s the man!\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s quite straightforward, really,\u201d said Neville modestly. \u201cI\u2019d been in here about \na day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and \nthat\u2019s when the passage to Hog\u2019s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. \nHe\u2019s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\u2019s the one thing the room \ndoesn\u2019t really do. \n\n \u201cYeah, well, food\u2019s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental \nTransfiguration,\u201d said Ron to general astonishment. \n\n \u201cSo we\u2019ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\u201d said Seamus, \u201cand it just \nmakes more hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good \nbathroom once girls started turning up \u2013 \u201c \n\n \u201c\u2014and thought they\u2019d quite like to wash, yes,\u201d supplied Lavender Brown, whom \nHarry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized \nmany familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, \nAnthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner. \n\n \u201cTell us what you\u2019ve been up to, though,\u201d said Ernie. \u201cThere\u2019ve been so many \nrumors, we\u2019ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.\u201d He pointed at the \nwireless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break into", "PPL": 7.172054767608643, "PPL/lower": 0.9847843443210176, "PPL/zlib": 0.002186602063295318, "Min-5%": 34.69838624842026, "Min-10%": 29.10103069567213, "Min-20%": 22.992565814906637, "Min-30%": 19.05338219943963, "Min-40%": 16.1869151656377, "Min-50%": 13.89802663323933, "Min-60%": 11.909052495459392}, {"text": ". He couldn't see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .\n\u3000\u3000And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him -\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\"\n\u3000\u3000Someone was slapping his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"W -- what?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you okay?\" Ron asked nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature had vanished. \"What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one screamed,\" said Ron, more nervously still.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"But I heard screaming --\"\n\u3000\u3000A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here,\" he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \"Eat it. It'll help.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that thing?\" he asked Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\"\n\u3000\u3000Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me...\n\u3000\u3000He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, watching Harry anxiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't get it.... What happened?\" said Harry, wiping more sweat off his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought you were having a fit or something,\" said Ron, who still looked scared. \"You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching -- 11\n\u3000\u3000\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... \"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was horrible,\" said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \"Did YOU feel how cold it got when it came in?\"\n\u3000\u3000I felt weird,\" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \"Like I'd never be cheerful again....\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her.\n\u3000\u3000\"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?\" said Harry awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \"Ginny was shaking like mad, though....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, \"I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you know....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Are you all right, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" he muttered, embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firs' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\n\u3000\u3000The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.\n\u3000\u3000As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,\n\u3000\u3000Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.\n\u3000\u3000As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy fainted?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously. \"Shove off, Malfoy,\" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you faint as well, Weasley?\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Did the scary old dementor frighten you too, Weasley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is there a problem?\" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he said, \"Oh, no -- er -- Professor,\" then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.\n\u3000\u3000The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter!

The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn't either.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked horrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"\"You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone will give you permission -- \" musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, look who it is,\" said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the compartment door. \"Potty and the Weasel.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer, Weasley,\" said Malfoy. \"Did your mother die of shock?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back. \"What were you saying, Malfoy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,\" he said angrily. \"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get hold of his head and --\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a violent gesture in midair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \"be careful...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.\n\u3000\u3000The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.\n\u3000\u3000The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. \"I'm starving. I want to get to the feast....\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't be there yet,\" said Hermione, checking her watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"So why're we stopping?\"\n\u3000\u3000The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments.\n\u3000\u3000The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.\n\u3000\u3000\"'What's going on?\" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" gasped Hermione. \"Ron, that was my foot!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his way back to his seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've broken down?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno...\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving out there,\" Ron said. \"I think people are coming aboard....\"\n\u3000\u3000The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over Harry's legs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry\n\u3000\u3000\"Hullo, Neville,\" said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea -- sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on Crookshanks.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on,\" came Hermione's voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I was looking for Ron --\" \"Come in and sit down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not here!\" said Harry hurriedly. \"I'm here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ouch!\" said Neville.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quiet!\" said a hoarse voice suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear movements in his corner.\n\u3000\u3000None of them spoke.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stay where you are,\" he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.\n\u3000\u3000Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water...\n\u3000\u3000But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak.\n\u3000\u3000And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.\n\u3000\u3000An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside his very heart....\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes rolled up into his head", "PPL": 5.141002178192139, "PPL/lower": 0.9131498862571211, "PPL/zlib": 0.001650931977582575, "Min-5%": 30.611636872385063, "Min-10%": 25.048362918928557, "Min-20%": 18.839172598785176, "Min-30%": 15.148069274541998, "Min-40%": 12.451747451259921, "Min-50%": 10.25265818531329, "Min-60%": 8.568773790071521}, {"text": "Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath.

Harry was failing again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head -- \"Not Harry!

The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry,\" he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes...\" Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Here --\" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's getting worse,\" Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. \"I could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked paler than usual. ,\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I do!\" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. \"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right then... \" said Lupin. \"You might want to select 'other memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn't seem to have been strong enough....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go!\" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -\n\u3000\u3000\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --\"\n\u3000\u3000White fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around him... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --\n\u3000\u3000\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --\"\n\u3000\u3000The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a cackle of high- pitched laughter --\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! Harry... wake up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard my dad,\" Harry mumbled. \"That's the first time I've ever heard him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.\n\u3000\u3000\"You heard James?\" said Lupin in a strange voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\" Face dry, Harry looked up. \"Why -- you didn't know my dad, did you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I -- I did, as a matter of fact,\" said Lupin. \"We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested putting you through this....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry. He got up again. \"I'll have one more go! I'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on....\"\n\u3000\u3000He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus...\n\u3000\u3000The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he didn't know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. \"Concentrating hard? All right -- go!\"\n\u3000\u3000He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark\n\u3000\u3000'EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry bellowed. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"\n\u3000\u3000The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how much longer, he wasn't sure --\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddikulus!\" roared Lupin, springing forward.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent!\" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \"Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Can we have another go? Just one more go?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not now,\" said Lupin firmly. \"You've had enough for one night. Here --\"\n\u3000\u3000He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Lupin?\" he said. \"If you knew my dad, you must've known Sirius Black as well.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin turned very quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What gives you that idea?\" he said sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too....\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's face relaxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts wandered back to his mother and father...\n\u3000\u3000He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again....\n\u3000\u3000\"They're dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"", "PPL": 5.922451496124268, "PPL/lower": 0.9390048497520388, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019067776870973173, "Min-5%": 34.45252586813534, "Min-10%": 28.37036282408471, "Min-20%": 21.592189383098724, "Min-30%": 17.364185080854433, "Min-40%": 14.313353518693546, "Min-50%": 11.808557773323935, "Min-60%": 9.87135462303485}, {"text": "Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which \nhe became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a \nclose friend. \n\n\u201cAnd, of course, you \u2018ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\u201d said Monsieur \nDelacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of \npure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw \nHarry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes.

Mr. \nand Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur \nand Madame Delacour\u2019s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was \nsleeping with Fleur in Percy\u2019s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best \nman, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became \nvirtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to \nvolunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house. \n\n\u201cBut she still won\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a \nmeeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket \nof laundry in her arms. \n\n\u201cOh, good, you\u2019ve fed the chickens,\u201d she called as she approached them. \u201cWe\u2019d \nbetter shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the \nwedding,\u201d she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse.

It\u2019s no trouble. . . .\u201d \n\nShe looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened \nup, and walked away.

Far below, \nswathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the \nman he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the \nanswer to his problem...? \n\n\"Oi, wake up.\" \n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron's dingy attic \nroom. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep \nwith his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. \n\n\f\n\"You were muttering in your sleep.\" \n\n\"Was I?\" \n\n\"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'\" \n\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. \n\n\"Who's Gregorovitch?\" \n\n \n\n\"I dunno, do I?\" You were the one saying it.\" \n\nHarry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name \nbefore, but he could not think where. \n\n\"I think Voldemort's looking for him.\" \n\n\"Poor bloke,\" said Ron fervently. \n\nHarry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember \nexactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon \nand the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley. \n\n\"I think he's abroad.\" \n\n\"Who, Gregorovitch?\" \n\n\"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't \nlook like anywhere in Britain.\" \n\n\"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?\" \n\nRon sounded worried. \n\n\"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Although how she expects \nme to stop seeing stuff in my sleep...\" \n\nHe gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking...Why was the name \n\"Gregorovitch\" familiar? \n\n\"I think,\" he said slowly, \"he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some \nconnection, but I can't--I can't think what it is.\" \n\n\"Quidditch?\" said Ron. \"Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?\" \n\n\"Who?\" \n\n\"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record \nfee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.\" \n\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.\" \n\n \n\n\"I try not to either,\" said Ron. \"Well, happy birthday anyway.\" \n\n\"Wow -- that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!\" \n\nHarry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk \nwhere he had left his glasses, and said, \"Accio Glasses!\" Although they were only around \na foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward \nhim, at least until they poked him in the eye. \n\n\"Slick,\" snorted Ron. \n\nReveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around \nthe room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry \nalso tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes \nto untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's \nChudley Cannons posters bright blue. \n\n\f\n\"I'd do your fly by hand, though,\" Ron ad", "PPL": 6.618824481964111, "PPL/lower": 1.0172567529013297, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020742163841943316, "Min-5%": 35.75014826830696, "Min-10%": 29.543706734975178, "Min-20%": 22.800495019460367, "Min-30%": 18.596843055482797, "Min-40%": 15.507459169495077, "Min-50%": 13.048462782087913, "Min-60%": 11.02099486685537}, {"text": "\nmoments he muttered to Harry, \u201cDid you see he\u2019s grown a stupid little beard?\u201d \n\n Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. \n\n A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring \nbroken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the \naisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of \namethyst colored robes with a matching hat. \n\n A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both \nwearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and \nthere was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as \nmusic swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons. \n\n \u201cOoooh!\u201d said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. \n\n A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as \nMonsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur \nDelacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and \nseemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed \neveryone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and \nGabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur \nhad reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. \n\n\f\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, \nHarry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, \nnow standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate the \nunion of two faithful souls\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,\u201d said Auntie Muriel in a rather \ncarrying whisper. \u201cBut I must say, Ginevra\u2019s dress is far too low cut.\u201d \n\n Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front \nagain. Harry\u2019s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons \nspent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; \nthey had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours \nfrom a normal person\u2019s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead\u2026. \n\n \u201cDo you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle\u2026?\u201d \n\n In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly \ninto scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that \nHagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned \naround and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. \n\n \u201c\u2026then I declare you bonded for life.\u201d \n\n The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and \na shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As \nFred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of \nparadise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and \nchimes to the din. \n\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d called the tufty-haired wizard. \u201cIf you would please \nstand up!\u201d \n\n They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The \nscars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the \nmarquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a \nglorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten \ngold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering \nchairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated \ngracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium. \n\n \u201cSmooth,\u201d said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some \nhearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of \ntarts and sandwiches. \n\n \u201cWe should go and congratulate them!\u201d said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see \nthe place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have time later,\u201d shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing \ntray and handing one to Harry. \u201cHermione, cop hold, let\u2019s grab a table\u2026. Not there! \nNowhere near Muriel \u2013\u201c \n\n Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; \nHarry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached \nthe other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one \nwhere Luna sat alone. \n\n \u201cAll right if we join you?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said happily. \u201cDaddy\u2019s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our \npresent.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat is it, a lifetime\u2019s supply of Gurdyroots?\u201d asked Ron. \n\n Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes \nwatering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. \n\n The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great \napplause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by \nMr. Weasley and Fleur\u2019s father. \n\n \u201cI like this song,\u201d said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few \nseconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the \nspot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s great isn\u2019t she?\u201d said Ron admiringly. \u201cAlways good value.\u201d \n\n But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into \nLuna\u2019s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not \ncome to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \u201cWho is that man in the \nyellow?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\u2019s the father of a friend of ours,\u201d said Ron. His \npugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the \nclear provocation. \u201cCome and dance,\u201d he added abruptly to Hermione. \n\n She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into \nthe growing throng on the dance floor. \n\n \u201cAh, they are together now?\u201d asked Krum, momentarily distracted. \n\n \u201cEr \u2013 sort of,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d Krum asked. \n\n \u201cBarny Weasley.\u201d \n\n They shook hands. \n\n \u201cYou, Barny \u2013 you know this man Lovegood well?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, I only met him today. Why?\u201d \n\n Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting \nto several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. \n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Krum, \u201cIf he vus not a guest of Fleur\u2019s I vould dud him, here and \nnow, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest.\u201d \n\n \u201cSign?\u201d said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye \nwas gleaming on his chest. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelvald. That is Grindelvald\u2019s sign.\u201d \n\n \u201cGrindelwald\u2026", "PPL": 6.7728166580200195, "PPL/lower": 0.9851358068772252, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020903755117345738, "Min-5%": 34.62038094389673, "Min-10%": 28.751554283441283, "Min-20%": 22.220725728713504, "Min-30%": 18.332098819533854, "Min-40%": 15.513074039976239, "Min-50%": 13.230497427284718, "Min-60%": 11.269421305446748}, {"text": "to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talk ing of nothing else for two weeks.

Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry tonelessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them -drinks. At eight- fifteen -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, Dudley, you'll say -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\n\u3000\u3000\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Perfect. . . Dudley?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How about -'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"'\n\u3000\u3000This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you, boy?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Ma sons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way.

With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow. Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: \"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . . No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the\n\u3000\u3000Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.\n\u3000\u3000What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream ....\n\u3000\u3000Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\n\u3000\u3000The huge eyes blinked and vanished.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the week.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why're you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - you haven't got any friends to take you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly wiggly -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor\n\u3000\u3000the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.\n\u3000\u3000While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, was", "PPL": 0.14629606902599335, "PPL/lower": 0.211967478766253, "PPL/zlib": 4.6859727426647455e-05, "Min-5%": 2.9198331272996523, "Min-10%": 1.464860152263724, "Min-20%": 0.7317633518037183, "Min-30%": 0.48764461556401945, "Min-40%": 0.366076586961351, "Min-50%": 0.2927295269622622, "Min-60%": 0.2438648937368071}, {"text": "reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year- younger Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\n\u3000\u3000*2 45 *\n\u3000\u3000see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\n\u3000\u3000It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\n\u3000\u3000Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard.\n\u3000\u3000For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon ... gotta get yeh outta here .... C'mon now ... in the box. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was something familiar about that voice ....\n\u3000\u3000Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply.\n\u3000\u3000The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n\u3000\u3000\"What yer doin' down here, Tom?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle stepped closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop.\"\n\u3000\u30004 6\n\u3000\u3000\"N\" at d'yeh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn't him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\n\u3000\u3000His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone\n\u3000\u3000A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NO000000!\"\n\u3000\u3000The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000*24 7*\n\u3000\u3000Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.\n\u3000\u3000\"There you are,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three- headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.\n\u3000\u3000Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\n\u3000\u3000he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully.\n\u3000\u3000\"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron tried a different tack.\n\u3000\u3000\"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stay here ......\n\u3000\u3000\"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That'd be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"'Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\"'\n\u3000\u3000In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became\n\u3000\u3000hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment they start trying to move into each other", "PPL": 0.19680407643318176, "PPL/lower": 0.27956729454394835, "PPL/zlib": 5.8037179720784946e-05, "Min-5%": 3.899013949813796, "Min-10%": 1.9695888302453302, "Min-20%": 0.984299170769282, "Min-30%": 0.6559628101750405, "Min-40%": 0.49244960043685365, "Min-50%": 0.3937890768232556, "Min-60%": 0.3280571127723984}, {"text": "said to Ron, and he went downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor.

For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves -- they've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice!

It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry\n\u3000\u3000There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: 'He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts.' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You- Know-Who, and he's had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn't happy about it, but he agreed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not happy? Why shouldn't he be happy, if they're there to catch Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them, said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It's late, Molly, we'd better go up....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron's room in search of his badge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got it,\" Fred whispered to Harry. \"We've been improving it.\"\n\u3000\u3000The badge now read Bighead Boy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.\n\u3000\u3000So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He'd made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very remote.\n\u3000\u3000No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passed.\n\u3000\u3000He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn't look after himself? He'd escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn't completely useless....\n\u3000\u3000Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to be murdered,\" Harry said out loud.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's the spirit, dear,\" said his mirror sleepily.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FIVE\n\u3000\u3000THE DEMENTOR\n\u3000\u3000Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\n\u3000\u3000\"The sooner we get on the train, the better,\" he said. \"At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,\" Ron grimaced, \"his girlfriend. She's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got something to tell you,\" Harry began, but they were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.\n\u3000\u3000They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What were you saying?\" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Later,\" Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had no chance to speak to Ron", "PPL": 5.837277889251709, "PPL/lower": 1.015394159255598, "PPL/zlib": 0.0017571577029655957, "Min-5%": 33.32045856176638, "Min-10%": 27.701922192293054, "Min-20%": 21.44131858191455, "Min-30%": 17.26582199199192, "Min-40%": 14.154788625269472, "Min-50%": 11.646875288013373, "Min-60%": 9.729514300588106}, {"text": "night,\" said Harry. \"We'd better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.\"\n\u3000\u3000*145*\n\u3000\u3000For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red- eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly' and \"looking happy.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\n\u3000\u3000\"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her bracingly. \"Honestly, we're much better off without her.\" Ginny's lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron assured her. \"They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking -\" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\n\u3000\u3000The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch- Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming\n\u3000\u3000*146*\n\u3000\u3000toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.\n\u3000\u3000Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a threefoot-long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European\n\u3000\u3000Wizards.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short\tsaid Ron fu\n\u3000\u3000riously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione's done four feet seven inches and her writing's tiny. \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.\n\u3000\u3000\"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think she's trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.\n\u3000\u3000\"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why do you want it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000*141*\n\u3000\u3000\"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's just it. I can't remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And I can't find the story anywhere else -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking his watch.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I won't,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You've had ten days to finish it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\n\u3000\u3000The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\n\u3000\u3000Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec\n\u3000\u3000*148*\n\u3000\u3000ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss - er -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice.\n\u3000\u3000Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown's head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom's elbow slipped off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk s!-ping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers\n\u3000\u3000\"\n\u3000\u3000He stuttered to a halt. Hermione's hand was waving in the air again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Miss Grant?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Please, sir, don't legends always have a basis in fact?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry\n\u3000\u3000*149*\n\u3000\u3000could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ...\n\u3000\u3000\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"\n\u3000\u3000He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\n\u3000\u3000\"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to", "PPL": 0.08465665578842163, "PPL/lower": 0.14172561826585206, "PPL/zlib": 2.4396730774761276e-05, "Min-5%": 1.684989164583385, "Min-10%": 0.8462217636931432, "Min-20%": 0.42312604087873984, "Min-30%": 0.28209773122339815, "Min-40%": 0.21181244241172426, "Min-50%": 0.1693862461561562, "Min-60%": 0.14111472985928453}, {"text": ", Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners.\" \n\n \"Yeah, me too. I can't believe \u2013\" \n\n Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind \nHagrid. \n\n \"You!\" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. \n\n \"Your wand's here, son,\" said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. \"It fell right beside \nyou, I picked it up\u2026And that's my wife you're shouting at.\" \n\n \"Oh, I'm \u2013 I'm sorry.\" \n\n As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister \nBellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light\u2019s oft brown and her eyes \nwere wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's \nexclamation. \n\n \"What happened to our daughter?\" she asked. \"Hagrid said you were ambushed; \nwhere is Nymphadora?\" \n\n \"I don't know,\" said Harry. \"We don't know what happened to anyone else.\" \n\n\f\n She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the \nsight of their expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He \nhad consented to the plan, given them his hair . . . \n\n \"The Portkey,\" he said, remembering all of a sudden. \"We've got to get back to \nthe Burrow and find out \u2013 then we'll be able to send you word, or \u2013 or Tonks will, once \nshe's \u2013\" \n\n \"Dora'll be ok, 'Dromeda,\" said Ted. \"She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of \ntight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here,\" he added to Harry. \"It's \nsupposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\" \n\n \"Yeah, we do,\" said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. \"I \n\u2013\" \n\n He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he \nleft her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he \ndid not seem hollow and insincere. \n\n \"I'll tell Tonks \u2013 Dora \u2013 to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, \nthanks for everything, I \u2013\" \n\n He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and \ninto a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the \ndoor lintel. \n\n \"There you go, son. That's the Portkey.\" \n\n Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing \ntable. \n\n \"Thanks,\" said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. \n\n \"Wait a moment,\" said Hagrid, looking around. \"Harry, where's Hedwig?\" \n\n \"She . . . she got hit,\" said Harry. \n\n The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung \nhis eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world \nwhenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys. \n\n Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. \n\n \"Never mind,\" he said gruffly, \"Never mind. She had a great old life \u2013\" \n\n \"Hagrid!\" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and \nHagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time. \n\n With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged \nhim forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued \nto the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet \nslammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. \nHe heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, \nswaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back \ndoor as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet. \n\n \"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\" cried \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n \"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?\" Harry panted. \n\n The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. \n\n \"The Death Eaters were waiting for us,\" Harry told her, \"We were surrounded the \nmoment we took off \u2013 they knew it was tonight \u2013 I don't know what happened to anyone \n\n\f\nelse, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort \ncaught up with us \u2013\" \n\n He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand \nwhy he did not know what had happened to her sons, but \u2013 \n\n \"Thank goodness you're all right,\" she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel \nhe deserved. \n\n \"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\" asked Hagrid a little shakily, \"Fer \nmedicinal purposes?\" \n\n She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the \ncrooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she \nanswered his unspoken plea for information at once. \n\n \"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it \ncame back without them,\" she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. \n\"And that one,\" she pointed at an ancient sneaker, \"should have been Dad and Fred's, \nthey were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\" she checked her \nwatch, \"if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be back in about a minute.\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. \nHe uncorked it and drank it straight down in one. \n\n \"Mum!\" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. \n\n A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin \nand George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was \nsomething wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face \nwas covered in blood. \n\n Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried \nGeorge into the house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on \nthe sofa. As the lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach \nlurched: One of George's ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched \nin wet, shockingly scarlet blood. \n\n No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the \nupper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was \nstill attempting to ease his bulk through the back door. \n\n \"Oi!\" said Hagrid indignantly, \"Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!\" \n\n Lupin ignored him. \n\n \"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office \nat Hogwarts?\" he said, giving Harry a small shake. \"Answer me!\" \n\n \"A \u2013 a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?\" \n\n Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. \n\n \"Wha' was tha' about?\" roared Hagrid. \n\n \"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\" said Lupin tersely. \"We've been betrayed. \nVoldemort knew that you were being moved tonight", "PPL": 6.849898338317871, "PPL/lower": 1.0104082343055127, "PPL/zlib": 0.002211071122762386, "Min-5%": 34.76040989744897, "Min-10%": 29.216952492209042, "Min-20%": 22.789336955343305, "Min-30%": 18.694420138865418, "Min-40%": 15.749939760543898, "Min-50%": 13.398301454117105, "Min-60%": 11.398573192837572}, {"text": ".\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open up,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Except that the words weren't what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.\n\u3000\u3000Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do.\n\u3000\u3000*300*\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going down there,\" he said. .\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me too,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \"I'll just -\"\n\u3000\u3000He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can go first,\" Ron snarled.\n\u3000\u3000White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\n\u3000\u3000\"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.\n\u3000\u3000\"I really don't think -\" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.\n\u3000\u3000It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\n\u3000\u3000And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\n\u3000\u3000*301\n\u3000\u3000feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.\n\u3000\u3000All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.\n\u3000\u3000The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000\"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . .....\n\u3000\u3000But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\n\u3000\u3000* 302 *\n\u3000\u3000Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.\n\u3000\u3000The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\n\u3000\u3000\"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly.\n\u3000\u3000There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\"\n\u3000\u3000He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\"\n\u3000\u3000The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here!\" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='\n\u3000\u3000*303*\n\u3000\u3000There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What now?\" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in?\n\u3000\u3000There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours .... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on.... If I'm not back in an hour. . .\n\u3000\u3000There was a very pregnant pause,\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.\n\u3000\u3000And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\n\u3000\u3000Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\n\u3000\u3000*304*\n\u3000\u3000Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\n\u3000\u3000He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\n\u3000\u3000The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\n\u3000\u3000e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber.

The pair of 'em \ncame home for my mother's \n\nfuneral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. \nHa!\" \n\n Aberforth spat into the fire. \n\n \"I'd have looked after her, I told him so, I didn't care about school, I'd have stayed \nhome and done it. \n\nHe told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a \ncomedown for Mr. Brilliant, \n\nthere's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house \nevery other day. But he \n\ndid all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\" \n\n And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\u2019s face. \n\n \"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as \nbright and talented he was. And \n\nlooking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a \nnew Wizarding order and looking \n\nfor Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the \nbenefit of all Wizardkind, and if one \n\nyoung girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater \ngood? \n\n \"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go \nhack to Hogwarts, so I told 'em, \n\nboth of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, \nand it took a little imagination to \n\nsee him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you'd \nbetter give it up now. You can't move her, \n\n\f\nshe's in no fit state, you can't take her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, \nwhen you're making your clever speeches, \n\ntrying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that.\" said Aberforth, and his \neyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on \n\nthe lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that \nat all. He got angry. He told me what a \n\nstupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . \nDidn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't \n\nhave to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and \ntaught the Muggles their place? \n\n \"And there was an argument . . . and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and \nI had the Cruciatus Curse used on \n\nme by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us \nwere dueling, and the flashing lights \n\nand the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it - \" \n\n The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal \nwound. \n\n \" - and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, \nand I don't know which of us did it, \n\nit could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" \n\n His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. \nHermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron \n\nwas almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not \nheard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it. \n\n \"I'm so . . . I'm so sorry,\" Hermione whispered. \n\n \"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\" \n\n He wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat. \n\n \" 'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in \nhis own country, and he didn't want Ariana \n\nset to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, \nfree to become the greatest wizard of the - \" \n\n \"He was never free,\" said Harry. \n\n \"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth. \n\n \"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that \ndrove him out of his mind. He started screaming, \n\npleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.' \" \n\n Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about \nwhat had happened on the island on the lake: \n\nThe events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had \neclipsed it so thoroughly. \n\n \"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said \nHarry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. \n\n\"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana . . . It was torture to \nhim, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.\" \n\n Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. \nAfter a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, \n\n\f\nthat my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be \nsure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?\" \n\n A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart. \n\n \"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione. \n\n \"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn't he say to \nhim, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?\" \n\n \"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you've got to \nthink about more than your own safety! Sometimes \n\nyou've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\" \n\n \"You're seventeen, boy!\" \n\n \"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\" \n\n \"Who says I've given up?\" \n\n \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who's won, \nit's over, and anyone who's pretending different's kidding \n\nthemselves.\" \n\n \"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!\" \n\n \"No, it isn't.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and \nhe passed the knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going \n\nuntil I succeed - or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for \nyears.\" \n\n He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved. \n\n \"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can't help us, we'll wait \ntill daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way \n\nin ourselves. If you can help us - well, now would be a great time to mention it.\" \n\n Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so \nextraordinarily like his brother's. At last he cleared his \n\nthroat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana. \n\n \"You know what to do,\"", "PPL": 6.580141544342041, "PPL/lower": 1.001550784246697, "PPL/zlib": 0.0021817445438799873, "Min-5%": 34.4994951135972, "Min-10%": 28.671626455643597, "Min-20%": 21.830774218645537, "Min-30%": 17.801324263457754, "Min-40%": 15.030038733354116, "Min-50%": 12.828680288057523, "Min-60%": 10.940990495807961}, {"text": "vised Harry, sniggering when Harry \nimmediately checked it. \"Here's your present.

Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this \nlast year I'd have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to \nget going with...

That's our \npresent on top.\" \n\nHarry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. \nInside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his \nseventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the race instead of hands. \n\n\"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,\" said Mrs. \nWeasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. \"I'm afraid that one isn't new \nlike Ron's, it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his \npossessions, it's a bit dented on the back, but--\" \n\nThe rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put \na lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted \nhis cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, \ncausing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. \n\n\"Happy birthday, Harry!\" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her \nown present to the top of the pile. \"It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get \nhim?\" she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her. \n\n\"Come on, then, open Hermione's!\" said Ron. \n\nShe had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an \nenchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\"Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you \nwill ever 'ave,\" Monsieur Delacour assured him, \"but you must tell it clearly what you \nwant...ozzerwise you might find you 'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...\"), \nchocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys' Wizard \nWheezes merchandise from Fred and George. \n\n \n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame \nDelacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. \n\n\"I'll pack these for you,\" Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his \narms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \"I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the \nrest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron--\" \n\nRon's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. \n\n\"Harry, will you come in here a moment?\" \n\n\f\nIt was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow \nand tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. \n\nHe had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large \nposter of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog \nJones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A \ndesk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and \nGinny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now \nhoused a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny's \nwindow. \n\nGinny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, \"Happy \nseventeenth.\" \n\n\"Yeah...thanks.\" \n\nShe was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; \nit was like gazing into a brilliant light. \n\n\"Nice view,\" he said feebly, pointing toward with window. \n\nShe ignored this. He could not blame her. \n\n\"I couldn't think what to get you,\" she said. \n\n \n\n\"You didn't have to get me anything.\" \n\nShe disregarded this too. \n\n\"I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn't be \nable to take it with you.\" \n\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many \nwonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that \nhaving six brothers must have toughened her up. \n\nShe took a step closer to him. \n\n\"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, \nif you meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing.\" \n\n\"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be \nhonest.\" \n\n\"There's the silver lining I've been looking for,\" she whispered, and then she was \nkissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it \nwas blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, \nGinny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-- \n\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. \n\n\"Oh,\" said Ron pointedly. \"Sorry.\" \n\n\"Ron!\" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained \nsilence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, \n\n\"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\" \n\nRon's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door \nin their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door \nopened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for \nending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk \ninside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. \n\n\f\nHe looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but \nshe had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to \ntears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. \n\n\"I'll see you later,\" he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. \n\nRon marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and \nHarry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking \nscared. \n\nOnce he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. \n\n\"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\" \n\n\"I'm not messing her around,\" said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. \n\n\"Ron--\" \n\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her. \n\n", "PPL": 6.978927135467529, "PPL/lower": 1.032015466547942, "PPL/zlib": 0.002207822567373467, "Min-5%": 38.29714610529881, "Min-10%": 31.723714968737433, "Min-20%": 24.47770533759903, "Min-30%": 19.799611663197073, "Min-40%": 16.467965330978597, "Min-50%": 13.818903407081962, "Min-60%": 11.633679634809543}, {"text": "jet of green light.

Flames of abnormal size \nwere pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to \nsoot at their touch. \n\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his \nwand evaporated in the air. \n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d \n\nMalfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all \nof them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and \nthe fire pursued them.

Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of \n\n\f\nfiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and \nthe detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their \nfanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. \n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione \nstopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and \nhorns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. \n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \n\n\u201cHere!\u201d \n\nHarry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk \nand threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg \nover the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, \nmissing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The \nsmoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was \nconsuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a \nthousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in \nthe room. Harry couldnot see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped \nas low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was \nnothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . . \n\n\u201cHarry, let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get out!\u201d bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see \nwhere the door was through the black smoke. \n\nAnd then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible \ncommotion, the thunder of devouring flame. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 too \u2013 dangerous \u2013 !\u201d Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses \ngiving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, \nseeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . . \n\nAnd he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair \nof them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him \ncoming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no \ngood. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy\u2019s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of \nHarry\u2019s \u2013 \n\n\u201cIF WE DIE FOR THEM, I\u2019LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\u201d roared Ron\u2019s voice, and, \nas a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto \ntheir broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up \nbehind Harry. \n\n\u201cThe door, get to the door, the door!\u201d screamed Malfoy in Harry\u2019s ear, and Harry \nsped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly \nable to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring \nflames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in \ncelebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara \u2013 \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, what are you doing, the door\u2019s that way!\u201d screamed Malfoy, \nbut Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, \nturning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he \nhad it, caught it around his wrist \u2013 \n\nHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight \ntoward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had \n\n\f\nvanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the \nsmoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and \nmoments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor \nbeyond. \n\nMalfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. \nHarry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and \nRon and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. \n\n\u201cC-Crabbe,\u201d choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. \u201cC-Crabbe . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Ron harshly. \n\nThere was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge \nbangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on \nhorses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet \nwhen the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all \naround him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared \nwithin him. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ginny?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cShe was here. She was supposed to be going \nback into the Room of Requirement.\u201d \n\n\u201cBlimey, d\u2019you reckon it\u2019ll still work after that fire?\u201d asked Ron, but he too got to \nhis feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \u201cShall we split up and look \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, getting to her feet too.

Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn't noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn't even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks\n\u3000\u3000* 2:L2 *\n\u3000\u3000about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours' time.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.\n\u3000\u3000\"We still need a bit of the people you're changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-facdy, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it'll be best if you can get something of Crabbe's and Goyle's; they're Malfoys best friends, he'll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating him.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry's and Ron's stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they're bound to eat them. Once they're asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I don't think -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That could go seriously wrong -\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.\n\u3000\u3000\"The potion will be useless without Crabbe's and Goyle's hair,\" she said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\"\n\u3000\u3000*213*\n\u3000\u3000\"I've already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she's gone home for Christmas - so I'll just have to tell the Slytherins I've decided to come back.\"\n\u3000\u3000When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\n\u3000\u3000\"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\"\n\u3000\u3000But to Harry's and Ron's utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle's fore\n\u3000\u3000* _2 14 *\n\u3000\u3000head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe's hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\u3000\u3000They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny- faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry showed her Goyle's hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You'll need bigger sizes once you're Crabbe and Goyle.\"\n\u3000\u3000The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure I've done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says it should ... once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" Ron whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode's hair out of its bottle into the first glass.\n\u3000\u3000*215*\n\u3000\u3000The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dropped Goyle's hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe's into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle's turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe's a dark, murky brown.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \"We'd better not all drink them in here .... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won't fit. And Millicent Bulstrode's no pixie.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We'll take separate stalls.\"\n\u3000\u3000Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready?\" he called.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ready,\" came Ron's and Hermione's voices.\n\u3000\u3000\"One - two - three -\"\n\u3000\u3000Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps.

Good morning, Albert, aren\u2019t \nyou getting out?\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Harry in Runcorn\u2019s deep voice. \n\n Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. \nGlancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione\u2019s anxious face sinking back out of sight, \na tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge\u2019s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. \n\n \u201cWhat brings you here, Runcorn?\u201d asked the new Minister of Magic.

It\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d said Thicknesse. \u201cIf you ask me, the blood \ntraitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\u201d \n\n \u201cGood day, Minister.\u201d \n\n Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The \nmoment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out \nfrom under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in \nthe opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure \nhis big feet were hidden. \n\n Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after \ngleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner\u2019s name and \noccupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed \nto force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and \nHermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all \ntheir efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment\u2019s \nthought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck \nin court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do \nmagic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman\u2019s liberty possibly depending on the \noutcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly \nwell that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. \n\n He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The \nsilence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the \npurple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast \nover the place. \n\n Her office must be up here, Harry thought. \n\n It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but \non the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off \nalong the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring \ninstructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. \n\n Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway \nalong the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and \nwizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly \npolished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite \nmesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of \ncolored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, \nHarry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the \nsame pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was watching was the \ncreation of pamphlets \u2013 that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, \nfolded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. \n\n Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing \nthat he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed \n\n\f\npamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility \nCloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: \n\n \n\nMudbloods \n\nand the Dangers They Pose to \n\na Peaceful Pure-Blood Society \n\n \n\n Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of \nits petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author\u2019s \nname upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to \ntingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she \nsaid, still waving and twirling her wand, \u201cWill the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all \nday, does anyone know?\u201d \n\n \u201cCareful,\u201d said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages \nslipped and fell to the floor. \n\n \u201cWhat, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\u201d \n\n The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of \npamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there \nmight have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue \niris had been set into the wood \u2013 an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had \nknown Alastor Moody. \n\n For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He \neven forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. \nIt was not moving. It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read: \n\n \n\nDolores Umbridge \n\nSenior Undersecretary to the Minister \n\n \n\n Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read: \n\n \n\nHead of the Muggle-Born \n\nRegistration Commission \n\n \n\n Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon \ntheir work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty \noffice opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object \nwith little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the \nCloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground. \n\n It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of \nhim. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, \nthere came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The \nyoung witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her \nfellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the \ndoorknob, stepped into Umbridge\u2019s office, and closed the door behind him. \n\n\f\n He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge\u2019s office \nat Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls \nbore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, \ngamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness.

Compared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\n\u3000\u3000The reporter had reappeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \\What use is that? Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding neighbors.\n\u3000\u3000\"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his large purple fist, \"that hanging's the only way to deal with these people?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's runner beans.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I'd better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\n\u3000\u3000\"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh -- she's not coming here, is she?\"\n\u3000\u3000Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she was not a blood relative of Harry's (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister), he had been forced to call her \"Aunt\" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn't bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in Harry's mind.\n\u3000\u3000At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Marge'll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're on the subject\" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- \"we need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of entertainment.\n\u3000\u3000\"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you'll keep a civil tongue in your head when you're talking to Marge.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she's talking to me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, \"as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any -- any funny stuff while she's here.\n\u3000\u3000You behave yourself, got me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face, \"we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled.\n\u3000\u3000\"And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him, including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I'll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Duddy's got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. \"Mummy's bought him a lovely new bow tie.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \"See you in a bit, then,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\n\u3000\u3000\"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it'll be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large, purple face. \"It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?\" roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\n\u3000\u3000\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.\"\n\u3000\u3000He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hed", "PPL": 4.656710624694824, "PPL/lower": 0.9554601644151912, "PPL/zlib": 0.0014538590773321336, "Min-5%": 29.702280811235017, "Min-10%": 23.964438597361248, "Min-20%": 17.94796712590896, "Min-30%": 14.210214621081025, "Min-40%": 11.46854284631594, "Min-50%": 9.309517832380061, "Min-60%": 7.762172903465137}, {"text": "have happened?

His head drooped sadly.\n\u3000\u3000Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.\n\u3000\u3000\"So that's it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We're all down there... and now we've just got to wait until we come back up again....\"\n\u3000\u3000She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out... there were so many of them....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.\n\u3000\u3000\"But what was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\" said Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But who conjured it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but how could it have been?\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't you see what they looked like?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it one of the teachers?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn't a teacher.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But... maybe I imagined it.... I wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who did you think it was?\"\n\u3000\u3000I think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. I think it was my dad.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think you saw his ghost?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know... no... he looked solid....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But then --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But... from what I could see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.\n\u3000\u3000I know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....\n\u3000\u3000The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting.\n\u3000\u3000And then, at last, after over an hour...\n\u3000\u3000\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione. \"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right!\"\n\u3000\u3000The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --\n\u3000\u3000\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"We've got to move!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We mustn't, I keep telling you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick!\" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming any moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Back to Hagrid's!\" Harry said. \"It's empty now -- come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....\n\u3000\u3000The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\n\u3000\u3000Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment....\n\u3000\u3000For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid'", "PPL": 6.167860507965088, "PPL/lower": 0.9800650005409892, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020123525311468477, "Min-5%": 37.22771405238731, "Min-10%": 30.472223375357835, "Min-20%": 22.703263975297325, "Min-30%": 18.072824607842907, "Min-40%": 14.898726434171346, "Min-50%": 12.30141454911768, "Min-60%": 10.280641303150475}, {"text": "rol duty.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away.

His hair wasn't as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people's mouths will be It was Hagrid.' Frankly, I'm astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\"\n\u3000\u3000(ti agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thank you, Harry, said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ......\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don't you leave us here, sir, we've only got one more corridor to go -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class -\"\n\u3000\u3000And he hurried off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair, more like.\"\n\u3000\u3000They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.\n\u3000\u3000\"We were -we were-\" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and see -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"We haven't seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron's foot, \"and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry -\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand. Yes,\n\u3000\u3000Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they'd avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you've ever come up with.\"\n\u3000\u3000They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall's permission to visit Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they'd taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn't have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione's rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one'll ever know . .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry wasn't looking at Hermione's face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\n\u3000\u3000Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"TG and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey's view.\n\u3000\u3000It was no easy task. Hermione's hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free.\n\u3000\u3000It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\n\u3000\u3000Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born\n\u3000\u3000from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\n\u3000\u3000And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber's a basilisk - a giant serpent! That why I've been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It's because I understand Parseltongue . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the beds around him.\n\u3000\u3000\"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one's died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk.

I mean,\" Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \"he had \nthe real sword last, didn't he? \n\n\n\f\nHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing \nbehind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to \nthem, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. \nHe shook his head. \n\"Dumbledore\u2019s dead,\" he said. \"I saw it happen, I saw the body. He's \ndefinitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe\" \n\"Patronuses can change, though can't they?\" said Ron, \"Tonks\u2019s changed \ndidn't it?\" \nYeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why \nwouldn't he just hand us the sword? \n\"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was \nalive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's \nstories?\" \n\"Which is what?\" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate \nfor the answer. \n\"I dunno,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hacked \noff, he was having a laugh or --- or he just wanted to make it more \ndifficult, But I don't think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when \nhe gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well,\" Ron's ears turned bright \nred and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded \nwith his toe, \"he must've known I'd run out on you.\" \n\"No,\" Harry corrected him. \"He must've known you'd always want to come \nback.\" \nRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry \nsaid, \"Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\" \n\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron at once, \"people are talking about it quite a lot. \n'Course, if things were different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals \nwith Grindelwald, but now it's just something to laugh about for people who \ndidn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who \nthought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, \nthough. He was really young when they --\" \n\"Our age,\" said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in \nhis face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject. \nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry \ntook aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which \n\n\f\nHermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of \nblackthorn. \n\"*Engorgio*\" \n\"The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried \nagain. This time the spider grew slightly larger. \n\"Stop that,\" said Ron sharply, \" I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, \nokay?\" \nHarry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. \n\"Sorry --- *Reducio*\" \nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every \nminor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful \nthan those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt \nintrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of \nhis arm. \n\"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them \nnoiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to \nenlarge and reduce the spider. \"It\u2019s all a matter of confidence Harry.\" \nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about \nbreaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she \ncould take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he \nwould have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he \nagreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and \nvanished behind her book once more. \nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took \nfirst watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand \nlevitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and \nless powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk \nreading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small \nwooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it. \n\"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the \nnews like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are \nfollowing the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's \ngreat. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing \nlocations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... \nTrouble is, I missed the last one...\" \n\n\n\f\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random \nwords under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly \nfearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might \nnot have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione \nturned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the \nblackthorn wand. \nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. \n\"If it's annoying you, I'll stop!\" he told Hermione nervously. \nHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry. \n\"We need to talk,\"", "PPL": 6.392136573791504, "PPL/lower": 0.9838777354510077, "PPL/zlib": 0.0020088424179105922, "Min-5%": 34.49938149545707, "Min-10%": 28.40194138358621, "Min-20%": 21.84403222697288, "Min-30%": 17.849123748971895, "Min-40%": 14.953091462841826, "Min-50%": 12.60044451706104, "Min-60%": 10.642017076064981}, {"text": "the ashes.

They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled\n\u3000\u3000himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.\n\u3000\u3000Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\n\u3000\u3000\"It wasn' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it can't've bin him, I'll swear it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic if I have to -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, I -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- yeh've got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never ='\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I'll wait outside then, Headmaster.\"\n\u3000\u3000And he stomped out looking embarrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Harry, I don't,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.\n\u3000\u3000*208*\n\u3000\u3000\"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,\" he said gently. \"Anything at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin ....\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn't anything, Professor . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.\n\u3000\u3000\"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\n\u3000\u3000*209*\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through ......\n\u3000\u3000Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry's in a hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, he's off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\" said George, chortling.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't find it amusing either.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, don't,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin's heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's because he's bursting to say it's really him,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you're getting all the credit for his dirty work.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion's nearly ready. We'll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\"\n\u3000\u3000At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could\n\u3000\u3000*210*\n\u3000\u3000play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn't spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.\n\u3000\u3000Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione - you're not supposed to be in here -\" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.\n\u3000\u3000\"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \"I've been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It's ready.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron's four-poster. \"If we're going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\"\n\u3000\u3000211\n\u3000\u3000She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he'd be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.\n\u3000\u3000The rest of Harry's Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill.

Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at her shadowy face.\n\u3000\u3000\"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,\" he said slowly. \"What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid's three hours ago....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,\" said Hermione. \"We just heard ourselves leaving....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentration.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life....\" And then it hit him. \"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -- how will that help Sirius?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak -- they can escape together!\"\n\u3000\u3000From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?\" said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn't sound like anyone's there.... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.\n\u3000\u3000\"If anyone's looking out of the window --\" Hermione squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll run for it,\" said Harry determinedly. \"Straight into the forest, all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!\"\n\u3000\u3000Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest....\n\u3000\u3000Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of sight, Harry....\"\n\u3000\u3000They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh shouldn've come!\" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,\" Harry said fervently.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's tied outside!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.\n\u3000\u3000At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's cabin.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment --\"\n\u3000\u3000Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay!\" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're about to come out!\" Hermione breathed.\n\u3000\u3000And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay...\" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll tell them what really happened\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't kill him --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go quick. Don' listen....\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is the beast?\" came the cold voice of Macnair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --\"\n\u3000\u3000Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I'll do it.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,", "PPL": 5.725653171539307, "PPL/lower": 0.9404743834414119, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019117372859897518, "Min-5%": 33.61817717084698, "Min-10%": 28.088602832719392, "Min-20%": 21.583363218237544, "Min-30%": 17.188982566715453, "Min-40%": 13.964744261832575, "Min-50%": 11.431087861691518, "Min-60%": 9.543492051457276}, {"text": "\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a basilisk fang,\u201d said Hermione patiently. \u201cIt has to be \nsomething so destructive that the Horcrux can\u2019t repair itself.

Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked \nunder the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded \nChocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry \ninstinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, \nwhose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room \nthat need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books \nflying in every direction. \u201cwe will . . . we\u2019re sorry . . .\u201d \n\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after \nMrs. Weasley. \n\n\u201cit\u2019s like being a house-elf,\u201d complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his \nhead as he and Harry followed. \u201cExcept without the job satisfaction.

Harry, Ron, \nHermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur\u2019s family by this time; and \nit was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry \nattempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped \nout into the sunny backyard to await the visitors. \n\n\f\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old \nWellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by \ntwo new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was \nno breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had \nbeen shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, \nplucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, \nthought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes. \n\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the \nBurrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer \npossible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had \ntherefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by \nPortkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which \nturned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, \nladen with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf green robes, who \ncould be Fleur\u2019s mother. \n\n\u201cMaman!\u201d cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. \u201cPapa!\u201d \n\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head \nshorter and extremely plumb, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked \ngood-natured.

The force of it knocked her \nbackward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. \n\n \n\"Hermione!\" said Harry. \"Calm --\" \n\n \n\n\"I will not calm down!\" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; \nshe looked quite demented. \"Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione, will you please --\" \n\n \n\n\"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!\" she screeched. \"Don't you dare! Give it back \nnow!

I called you! I begged you to come back\" \n\"I know,\" Ron said, \"Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really --\" \n\n \n\n\"Oh, you're sorry!\" \n\n \n\nShe laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but \nHarry merely grimaced his helplessness. \n\n \n\n\"You came back after weeks -- weeks -- and you think it's all going to be all right if you \njust say sorry?\" \n\n \n\n\"Well, what else can I say?\" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back. \n\n \n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. \"Rack your brains, Ron, that \nshould only take a couple of seconds --\" \n\n \n\n\"Hermione,\" interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, \"he just saved my --\" \n\n \n\n\f\n\"I don't care!\" she screamed. \"I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could \nhave been dead for all he knew --\" \n\n \n\n\"I knew you weren't dead!\" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and \napproaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. \"Harry's all over \nthe Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and \nmental stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's \nbeen like --\" \n\n \n\n\"What it's been like for you?? \n\n \n\nHer voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a \nlevel of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his \nopportunity. \n\n \n\n\"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of \nSnatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!\" \n\"A gang of what?\" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her \narms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for \nseveral years. \n\n \n\n\"Snatchers,\" said Ron. \"They're everywhere -- gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up \nMuggle-borns and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone \ncaptured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, \nthought I was a Muggle-born in hiding.

One of them was definitely part troll, the smell of him....\" \n\n \n\nRon glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of \nhumor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. \n\n \n\n\"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be \nhonest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. \nThen two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit \nthe one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, \nand Disapparated. I didn't do it so well.

By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank \nwhere we'd been ... you were gone.\" \n\n \n\n\"Gosh, what a gripping story,\" Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when \nwishing to wound. \"You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's \nHollow and, let's think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake \nturned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and \nmissed us by about a second.\" \n\"What?\" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him. \n\n \n\"Imagine losing fingernails, Harry!

Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?\n\u3000\u3000He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\n\u3000\u3000*306*\n\u3000\u3000Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"tinny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n\u3000\u3000\"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.\n\u3000\u3000A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him\n\u3000\u3000\"Tom - Tom Riddle?\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly.\n\u3000\u3000* 30 7*\n\u3000\u3000\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\n\u3000\u3000He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here.

Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\n\u3000\u3000A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's smile broadened.\n\u3000\u3000\"You won't be needing it,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000*%08*\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, I won't be -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you.

We can talk later -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here ....\n\u3000\u3000\"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary.

There was an almost hungry look in them.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom .... I'm so glad I've got this diary to\n\u3000\u3000*309*\n\u3000\u3000confide in .... It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . .\n\u3000\u3000Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted .... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n\u3000\u3000\" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting, they became ....

When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\n\u3000\u3000Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n\u3000\u3000* 21:L *\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ......\n\u3000\u3000Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\n\u3000\u3000* 2-V2 *\n\u3000\u3000Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've come this far,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\n\u3000\u3000They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.\n\u3000\u3000Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen ... sounds like something big ......\n\u3000\u3000They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heard Fang!\"\n\u3000\u3000The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\n\u3000\u3000* 273*\n\u3000\u3000stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno -\"\n\u3000\u3000Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it's our car!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.\n\u3000\u3000*214*\n\u3000\u3000\"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\n\u3000\u3000\"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\n\u3000\u3000Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.\n\u3000\u3000He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders.

Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic.

As he did so, he gazed down at the \ntiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if \nfrom the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left \nbehind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry\u2019s grief for Dobby \nseemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a \nvast, silent ocean. \n\n\f\n \u201cI want to do it properly,\u201d were the first words of which Harry was fully \nconscious of speaking. \u201cNot by magic. Have you got a spade?\u201d And shortly afterward he \nhad set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end \nof the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, \nglorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a \ngift to the elf who had saved their lives. \n\n His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. \nHe had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing \nDumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able \nto possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could \nnot penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort \nout\u2026though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. \n\n On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in \nsweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his \nown breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the \nMalfoys\u2019 returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding \nblossomed in the darkness\u2026 \n\n The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. \nHallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026Hallows\u2026Horcruxes\u2026yet no longer burned with that weird, \nobsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been \nslapped awake again. \n\n Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had \nbeen tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why\u2026 \n\n And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of \nmercy\u2026Dumbledore had foreseen that\u2026How much more had he known? \n\n Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few \ndegrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean. \u201cHow\u2019s Hermione?\u201d \u201cBetter,\u201d said \nRon. \u201cFleur\u2019s looking after her.\u201d Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him \nwhy he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. \nThey jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they \nworked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. \n\n Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the \ngrave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf\u2019s bare feet. Dean \nproduced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby\u2019s head, muffling his \nbatlike ears. \u201cWe should close his eyes.\u201d \n\n Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a \ntraveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of \nwhat Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing \ngown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. \nLuna, who was huddled in one of Fleur\u2019s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers \ntenderly upon each of the elf\u2019s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare. \u201cThere,\u201d she \nsaid softly. \u201cNow he could be sleeping.\u201d \n\n Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have \nbeen resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced \nhimself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, and the rows and \nrows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of \n\n\f\nDumbledore\u2019s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that \nDobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a \nroughly dug hole. \u201cI think we ought to say something,\u201d piped up Luna. \u201cI\u2019ll go first, \nshall I?\u201d \n\n And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the \ngrave. \u201cThank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It\u2019s so unfair that \nyou had to die when you were so good and brave. I\u2019ll always remember what you did for \nus. I hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d \n\n She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a \nthick voice, \u201cyeah\u2026thanks Dobby.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d muttered Dean. Harry swallowed. \n\u201cGood bye Dobby,\u201d he said It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. \nBill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell \nneatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. \u201cD\u2019ya mind if I stay here a moment?\u201d He asked \nthe others. \n\n They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and \nthen they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. \n\n He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the \nsea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, \npillowlike, over the place where Dobby\u2019s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for \na wand. There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now \nremember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of \nsomeone\u2019s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and \npointed it at the rock. \n\n Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock\u2019s \nsurface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more \nquickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry \nstood up again, the stone read: HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. \n\n He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar \nstill prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, \nideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. \n\n They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their \nattention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a \nsmall fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud \nupon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening. \n\n \u201c\u2026lucky that Ginny\u2019s on holiday. If she\u2019d been at Hogwarts they could have \ntaken her before we reached her.

Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well -- there might have been!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll take it!\" said Ron eagerly. \"I've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys' staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can I sit down, then?\" Harry asked Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.\n\u3000\u3000\"How are you getting through all this stuff?\" Harry asked her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,\" said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?\" Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.\n\u3000\u3000\"I couldn't do that!\" said Hermione, looking scandalized.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no, it's wonderful!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"It's my favorite subject!

The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.\n\u3000\u3000\"LOOK!\" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, what --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"N -- no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation.

Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie.\n\u3000\u3000Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\" she said shrilly. \"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said Fred bracingly. \"And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away.

If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? \n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d \n\nBut he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was \nrunning it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen \nanything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was \nexactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer \ncompletely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable \nconcealment, no matter what spells are cast at it\u2026 \n\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered\u2014 \n\n\u201cDumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\u201d \n\nHis voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \n\n\u201cMy mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He \nwanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is \nburied in Godric\u2019s Hollow\u2026\u201d Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as \n\n\f\nthough great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \u201cHe\u2019s my ancestor. I\u2019m \ndescended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\u201d \n\n\u201cHe felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of \npossessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the \nother two. \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his \nneck, his fingers shaking hard. \n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d he told her, pushing his mother\u2019s letter into her hand. \u201cRead it! \nDumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\u2019t need a \nCloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself \ncompletely invisible without one!\u201d \n\nSomething fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged \nthe Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly \ntapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder \nerupted inside him so that he shouted out. \n\n\u201cIT\u2019S IN HERE! He left me the ring \u2013 it\u2019s in the Snitch!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou --- you reckon?\u201d \n\nHe could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear \nto Harry. Everything fit, everything\u2026His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he \ndiscovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to \ndo was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then --- \n\nBut it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope \nand happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the \nglorious spell was broken. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s after.\u201d \n\nThe change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. \n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s after the Elder Wand.\u201d \n\nHe turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. \nIt all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a \nvery old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and \nHermione as he looked out into the night, thinking\u2026 \n\nVoldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him \nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. \nHardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew \nabout them? \n\nHarry gazed into the darkness\u2026If Voldemort had known about the Deathly \nHallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects \nthat made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he \nmight not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\u2019t the simple fact that he had \ntaken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last \ngreat Wizarding secret? \n\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full \npower, without understanding that it was one of three\u2026for the wand was the Hallow that \ncould not be hidden, whose existence was best known\u2026The bloody trail of the Elder \nWand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history\u2026 \n\n\f\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the \nface of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. \n\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing \nexactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\u2019s letter, Ron at her side \nlooking slightly anxious. Didn\u2019t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few \nminutes? \n\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own \nastonished certainty, \u201cThis explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I\u2019ve \ngot one --- maybe two ---\u201c \n\nHe held up the Snitch. \n\n\u201c--- and You-Know-Who\u2019s chasing the third, but he doesn\u2019t realize\u2026he just \nthinks it\u2019s a powerful wand ---\u201c \n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily\u2019s letter, \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think you\u2019ve got this wrong, all wrong.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see?

Harry, you\u2019re just getting carried away. \nPlease,\u201d she said as she started to speak, \u201cplease just answer me this: If the Deathly \nHallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who \npossessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn\u2019t he have told \nyou?

The zigzagging path leading to the front door \nwas overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange \nradishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a \nSnargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent \nwith the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy \ncrowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little \nowl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the \nbranches. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you Mr. \nLovegood wants to help, not us.\u201d \n\n He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She \nthen rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and \nbore a knocker shaped like an eagle. \n\nBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood \nXenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained \nnightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius \nhad been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by comparison. \n\"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\" he cried in a \nhigh-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and \nfinally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O. \n\"Hello, Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry, holding out his hand, \"I'm Harry, \nHarry Potter.\" \nXenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not \npointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. \n\"Would it be okay if we came in?\" asked Harry. \"There's something we'd \nlike to ask you.\" \n\"I . . . I'm not sure that's advisable,\" whispered Xenophilius, He \nswallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \"Rather a shock . . . My \nword . . . I . . . I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to ---\" \n\"It wont take long\" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this \nless-than-warm welcome. \n\"I --- oh, all right then. Come in, quickly, Quickly!\" \nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door \nshut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had \never seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being \ninside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls - the \nstove, the sink, and the cupboards - and all of it had been painted with \nflowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he \nrecognized Luna's styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was \nslightly overwhelming. \nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase ld to the \nupper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from \noverhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing. \n\"You'd better come up.\" said Xenophilius, still looking extremely \nuncomfortable, and he led the way. \nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, \n\n\f\nand as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller \nand entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on \nthe unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic \nlabyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon \npiles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of \ncreatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung \nfrom the ceiling. \nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden \nobject covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the \nbizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment \nHarry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact \nthat it was churning out Quibblers. \n\"Excuse me,\" said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized \ngrubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, \nwhich all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat \nmuffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry. \n\"Why have you come here?\" \nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock. \n\"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?\" \nSee was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a \nunicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into \nthe room. \n\"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\" said Xenophilius. \n\"No it isn't!\" said Hermione. \n\"Hermione,\" muttered Harry, embarrassed, \"now's not the moment -\" \n\"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and \nit's an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!\" \n\"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?\" asked Ron, edging away from the \nhorn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room. \n\"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. \nLovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can \nexplode at the slightest touch?\" \n\"The Crumple Horned Snorkack\" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish \nlook upon his face, \u201cis a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -\" \n\"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's \nan Erumpent horn and it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got \nit-\" \n\"I bought it,\" said Xenophilius dogmatically. \"Two weeks ago, from a \ndelightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A \nChristmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\" he said, turning to Harry, \"why \nexactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?\" \n\"We need some help,\" said Harry, before Hermione could start again. \n\"Ah,\" said Xenophilius, \"Help, Hmm.\" \nHis good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously \nterrified and mesmerized. \n\"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...\" \n\n\f\n \"", "PPL": 5.799220085144043, "PPL/lower": 0.9494743201105532, "PPL/zlib": 0.0017637530672579207, "Min-5%": 31.388125232621736, "Min-10%": 26.080592099358054, "Min-20%": 20.03393843354689, "Min-30%": 16.367606659277254, "Min-40%": 13.687551574194053, "Min-50%": 11.48077257008147, "Min-60%": 9.660670324189267}, {"text": "\n\u201cParents,\u201d said Harry, \u201cshouldn\u2019t leave their kids unless \u2013 unless they\u2019ve got to.\u201d \n\n\u201cHarry \u2013\u201c said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off \nand walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to \nLupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled \nhim. Now Lupin\u2019s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a \n\n\f\nsickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that \nthey were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently. \n\nHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. \n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have called him a coward.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron at once. \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s acting like one.\u201d \n\n\u201cAll the same . . .\u201d said Hermione. \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\u2019ll be worth it, \nwon\u2019t it?\u201d \n\nHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron \nuncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have \nbacked Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son \nhad treated his old friend? \n\nThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron \nand Hermione\u2019s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still \nlying on the table, Harry\u2019s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He \nwalked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He \ncould not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He \nwas sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other \nside of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\u2019s name leapt out at him. It \nwas a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a \nfamily group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to \nright: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth. \n\nHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore\u2019s \nfather, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this \nfaded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no \nmore distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. \nHer face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he\u2019d \nseen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed \nabove a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets \nand had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but \notherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\u2019s nose had been \nbroken and before he started wearing glasses. \n\nThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the \nnewspaper. Baby Ariana\u2019s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the \npicture and saw the headline: \n\n \n\n EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING \n\n BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n\n by Rita Skeeter \n\n \n\nThinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry \nbegan to read: \n\n \n\n\f\nProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-\nWold after her husband Percival\u2019s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in \nAzkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric\u2019s Hollow, \nthe village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter\u2019s strange escape \nfrom You-Know-Who. \n\n Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric\u2019s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding \nfamilies, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about \nher husband\u2019s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the \nfriendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family \nwas left well alone. \n\n \u201cSlammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch \nof homemade Cauldron Cakes,\u201d says Bathilda Bagshot. \u201cThe first year they were \nthere I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn\u2019t have known there was a daughter if I \nhadn\u2019t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and \nsaw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, \nkeeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn\u2019t know what to make of \nit.\u201d \n\n It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric\u2019s Hollow was the perfect \nopportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been \nplanning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old \nwhen she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that \nmagic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever \ndemonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that \nKendra made a decision to hide her daughter\u2019s existence rather than suffer the shame \nof admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and \nneighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. \nThe tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana\u2019s existence could be \ncounted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected \nawkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \u201cMy sister is too \nfrail for school.\u201d \n\n Next week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts \u2013 the Prizes and the Pretense. \n\n \n\n Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He \nlooked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he \nfind out? He wanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk \nto him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. \nHe was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s opinions, \nwhen a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen. \n\n For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His \nimmediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he \ndid not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside \nhis chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to \nHarry, croaked, \u201cKreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\u201d \n\n Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too \nquick for him. \n\n \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d \n\n\f\n Mundungus\u2019s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, \nMundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone \nfloor with a muffled crunch. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\u2019s grip. \n\u201cWha\u2019ve I done?

He climbed over the paddock fence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good man, Harry!\" roared Hagrid. \"Right then -- let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\"\n\u3000\u3000He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \"Tha's it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha's it, Harry... now, bow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.\n\u3000\u3000The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry, easy does it\n\u3000\u3000But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!\"\n\u3000\u3000Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.\n\u3000\u3000The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!\"\n\u3000\u3000This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an' mind yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, then'\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.\n\u3000\u3000Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry, he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him. \"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you?\" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you great ugly brute?\"\n\u3000\u3000It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm dying!\" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I'm dying, look at me! It's killed me!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yer not dyin'!\" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me -- gotta get him outta here --\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the castle.\n\u3000\u3000Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"They should fire him straight away!\" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in tears.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was Malfoy's fault!\" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.\n\u3000\u3000They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to see if he's okay!\" said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000\"You think he'll be all right?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\" said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried. \"Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him....\"\n\u3000\u3000They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000\"They wouldn't fire him, would they?\" said Hermione anxiously, not touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'd better not,\" said Ron, who wasn't eating either.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,\" said Ron gloomily.\n\u3000\u3000They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's a light on in H", "PPL": 5.165863990783691, "PPL/lower": 0.9509265598612442, "PPL/zlib": 0.0016739675926065105, "Min-5%": 30.444547428804285, "Min-10%": 25.18013899934058, "Min-20%": 19.289060534358317, "Min-30%": 15.496183021837414, "Min-40%": 12.628643983733683, "Min-50%": 10.32274922836328, "Min-60%": 8.61084737960008}, {"text": "bling on the floor. \n\"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed \nhis wand at the crate blocking his view.

When the falsk was full to the brim, and Snape looked as \nthough there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes \nslackened. \n\"Look...at....me...\" he whispered. \nThe green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in \n\n\f\nthe depths of the dark pari seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, \nblank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and \nSnape moved no more. \n\n \n\nChapter Thirty-Three \n\nThe Prince\u2019s Tale \n\n \n\nHarry remained kneeling at Snape\u2019s side, simply staring down at him, until quite \nsuddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the \nflask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. \n\n Voldemort\u2019s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that \nhe was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of \nHogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he \nstood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \n\n \u201cYou have fought,\u201d said the high, cold voice, \u201cvaliantly. Lord Voldemort knows \nhow to value bravery. \n\n \u201cYet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all \ndie, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a \nloss and a waste. \n\n \u201cLord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. \n\n \u201cYou have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \n\n \u201cI speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to \ndie for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. \nIf, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then \nbattle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find \nyou, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you \nfrom me. One hour.\u201d \n\n Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry. \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Hermione wildly. \u201cLet\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s get back to the castle, if \nhe\u2019s gone to the forest we\u2019ll need to think of a new plan \u2013 \u201d \n\n She glanced at Snape\u2019s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron \nfollowed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He \ndid not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason \nfor which it had been done\u2026 \n\n They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered \nwhether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. \n\n You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I \nshall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest\u2026One hour\u2026 \n\n Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle (?). It could only \nbe an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the \nstone steps. A lone dog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There \nwas no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker. \n\n\f\n The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or \nscreams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. \nEmeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered \nwood. Part of the banisters had been blown away. \n\n \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d whispered Hermione. \n\n Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. \n\n The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in \ngroups, their arms around each other\u2019s necks. The injured were being treated upon the \nraised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the \ninjured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. \n\n The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred\u2019s body, \nbecause his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was \nlying across Fred\u2019s chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears \ncascaded down his cheeks. \n\n Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione \napproach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, \nand Percy, who flung an arm around Ron\u2019s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved \ncloser to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. \nRemus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, \nenchanted ceiling. \n\n The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled \nbackward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any \nof the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the \nWeasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first \nplace, Fred might never have died\u2026 \n\n He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks\u2026 He yearned not \nto feel\u2026 He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming \ninside him\u2026 \n\n The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass \nmourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of \nSnape\u2019s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle \nguarding the headmaster\u2019s office. \n\n \u201cPassword?\u201d \n\n \u201cDumbledore!\u201d said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned \nto see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. \n\n But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that \nhung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained \nto see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the \ncastle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on. \n\n Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore\u2019s deserted", "PPL": 6.4245381355285645, "PPL/lower": 1.0298230780331445, "PPL/zlib": 0.001961092226962321, "Min-5%": 34.10666420880486, "Min-10%": 28.352943383011162, "Min-20%": 22.00520154491322, "Min-30%": 17.892721489120383, "Min-40%": 14.911760914747823, "Min-50%": 12.597823209827766, "Min-60%": 10.69157207696562}, {"text": "fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new password.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's `wattlebird,\"' said Hermione impatiently, \"but that's not the point - \"\n\u3000\u3000Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after then-t.\n\u3000\u3000\"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people'll be talking about that one for years -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"\n\u3000\u300084\n\u3000\u3000Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy's direction. Ron got the point at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy's.\n\u3000\u3000They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but ='\n\u3000\u3000The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000\"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"Cool,\" said Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck.\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't help it. He grinned, too.\n\u3000\u3000* 85 *\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER Six\n\u3000\u3000GILDEROY LOCKHART\n\u3000\u3000he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls\n\u3000\u300086\n\u3000\u3000streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, he's still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not that - it's that.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's - she's sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It'll be worse if you don't My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" - he gulped - \"it was horrible.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's a Howler?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000But Ron's whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.\n\u3000\u3000\"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It'll all be over in a few minutes -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol's beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound fiIled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000\"STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.\n\u3000\u3000\"- LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn't hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.\n\u3000\u3000\"-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head.\n\u3000\u3000* 88\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Harry pushed his porridge away.

Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire.

When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.\n\u3000\u3000Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello there, Harry!\" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity... pity...\"\n\u3000\u3000He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?\" Ron interrupted, stepping forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!\" said Eon stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off!\"\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this.... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?\"\n\u3000\u3000The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why'd you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss!\" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in.\n\u3000\u3000Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry. knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.\n\u3000\u3000The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay?\"\n\u3000\u3000But they all refused to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a horrible accident!\" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock. \"Wish she'd hurry up...\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.\n\u3000\u3000\"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry and Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!\"\n\u3000\u3000She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder.\n\u3000\u3000\"How'd it go?\" Harry asked him, standing up.\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.

Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well?\" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see?\"\n\u3000\u3000The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them.

Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\n\u3000\u3000\"No blood?

You dropped the \nchandelier \u2013 ?\u201d \n\nThe tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. \n\n\u201cYou must not hurt Harry Potter,\u201d he squeaked. \n\n\u201cKill him, Cissy!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and \nNarcissa\u2019s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. \n\n\u201cYou dirty little monkey!\u201d bawled Bellatrix. \u201cHow dare you take a witch\u2019s wand, \nhow dare you defy your masters?\u201d \n\n\u201cDobby has no master!\u201d squealed the elf. \u201cDobby is a free elf, and Dobby has \ncome to save Harry Potter and his friends!\u201d \n\nHarry\u2019s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, \nseconds before Voldemort was with them. \n\n\u201cRon, catch \u2013 and GO!\u201d he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent \ndown to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who \nstill clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby\u2019s hand and spun on the \nspot to Disapparate. \n\nAs he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the \npale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron\u2019s hair, and a \nblue of flying silver, as Bellatrix\u2019s knife flew across the room at the place where he was \nvanishing \u2013 \n\nBill and Fleur\u2019s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur\u2019s . . . \n\nHe had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the \ndestination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead \npierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of \nGryffindor\u2019s sword bumping against his back: Dobby\u2019s hand jerked in his; he wondered \nwhether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by \nsqueezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with them. . . . \n\nAnd then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, \nrelinquished Dobby\u2019s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. \n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. \n\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short \nway away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. \n\n\u201cDobby, is this Shell Cottage?\u201d he whispered, clutching the two wands he had \nbrought from the Malfoys\u2019, ready to fight if he needed to. \u201cHave we come to the right \nplace? Dobby?\u201d \n\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. \n\n\u201cDOBBY!\u201d \n\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and \nHarry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf\u2019s heaving chest. \n\n\f\n\u201cDobby \u2013 no \u2013 HELP!\u201d Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people \nmoving there. \u201cHELP!\u201d \n\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; \nall he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby\u2019s front, and that he \nhad stretched out his own arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him \nand laid him sideways on the cool grass. \n\n\u201cDobby, no, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die \u2013\u201c \n\nThe elf\u2019s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. \n\n\u201cHarry . . . Potter . . .\u201d \n\nAnd then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing \nmore than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.\u201d \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Four \n\nThe Wandmaker \n\n \n\nIt was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside \nDumbledore\u2019s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was \nstaring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix\u2019s silver knife. Harry\u2019s \nvoice was still saying, \u201cDobby\u2026Dobby\u2026\u201d even though he knew that the elf had gone \nwhere he could not call him back. \n\n After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for \nhere were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. \n\u201cHermione,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d \n\n\u201cRon\u2019s taken her inside,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Harry looked back down at \nDobby.

Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" chuckled Hagrid. \"Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\" chimed in Professor Flitwick. \"Inseparable!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course they were,\" said Fudge. \"Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course.

Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How does that work?\" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"An immensely complex spell,\" he said squeakily, \"involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"Naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He suspected Black?\" gasped Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,\" said Professor McGonagall darkly. \"Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But James Potter insisted on using Black?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He did,\" said Fudge heavily. \"And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed --\" \"Black betrayed them?\" breathed Madam Rosmerta.\n\u3000\u3000\"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!\" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar went quiet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\u3000\u3000\"I met him!\" growled Hagrid. \"I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people!

Never occurred ter me what he was doin' there. I didn' know he'd bin Lily an' James's Secret-Keeper. Thought he'd jus' heard the news o' You-Know-Who's attack an' come ter see what he could do. White an' shakin', he was. An' yeh know what I did?

It was You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me orders from Dumbledore, an' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an' uncle's. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. 'I won't need it anymore,' he says.\n\u3000\u3000\"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin the Potters' Secret-Keeper.

After several \nmoments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddle in the \nentrance. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s You-Know-Who doing?\u201d \n\n Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered \ninto the darkness. \n\n \u201cHe found Gregorovitch.

Voldemort had said nothing about Harry\u2019s wand, \nnothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more \npowerful wand to beat Harry\u2019s. . . . \n\n \u201cHe wanted something from Gregorovitch,\u201d Harry said, eyes still closed tight. \n\u201cHe asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and \nthen . . . then . . .\u201d \n\n He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through \nGregorovitch\u2019s eyes, into his memories. . . . \n\n \u201cHe read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a \nwindowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he \nstole whatever You-Know-Who\u2019s after. And I . . . I think I\u2019ve seen him somewhere. . . .\u201d \n\n\f\n Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy\u2019s face. The theft \nhad happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look \nfamiliar? \n\n The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could \nhear was Ron\u2019s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see what the \nthief was holding?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo . . . it must\u2019ve been something small.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry?\u201d \n\n The wooden slats of Ron\u2019s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. \n\n \u201cHarry, you don\u2019t reckon You-Know-Who\u2019s after something else to turn into a \nHorcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cMaybe. But wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous for him \nto make another one? Didn\u2019t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, but maybe he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah . . .maybe,\u201d said Harry. \n\n He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem \nof the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and \nyet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. \n\n What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the \nWizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that \nGregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? \n\n Harry could still see the blond-haired youth\u2019s face; it was merry, wild; there was a \nFred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the \nwindowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . . \n\n With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and \nit was on him that Harry\u2019s thoughts dwelled, as Ron\u2019s snores began to rumble from the \nlower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more. \n\n \n\nChapter Fifteen \n\nThe Goblin\u2019s Revenge \n\n \n\n Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search \nthe woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could \nfind. There in its shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by \ngouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that \nMad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. \nThen he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were \ngoing to do next. \n\n Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron \nagreed, wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon \nsandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the \nclearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground \nthat might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a \nsmall market town. \n\n\f\n Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and \nsurrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the \nInvisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely \nentered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of \nthe skies made him freeze where he stood. \n\n\"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the \ntent empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. \n\n \"I couldn't . . . make one.\" he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \"Wouldn't . . . \ncome.\" \n\nTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had \nbeen a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the \ndistance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming \nfilled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's \nwillpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide \namongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the \ndespair they cast wherever they went. \n\n \"So we still haven't got any food.\" \n\n \"Shut up, Ron,\" snapped Hermione. \"Harry, what happened? Why do you think \nyou couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\" \n\n \"I don't know.\" \n\n He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the \nmoment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a \nlong time ago: Today me might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who \ncollapsed on the Hogwarts Express. \n\n Ron kicked a chair leg. \n\n \"What?\" he snarled at Hermione. \"I'm starving! All I've had since I bled half to \ndeath is a couple of toadstools!\" \n\n \"You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\" said Harry, stung. \n\n \"I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!\" \n\n \"That's convenient.\" \n\n \"And what's that supposed to \u2014 ?\" \n\n \"Of course!\" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both \nof them into silence. \"Harry, give me the locket!

If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any \nknowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news. \n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their \nhome. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the \nOrder of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it \nwere needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational \nsport under the new regime. \n\n\u201cFinally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot \nhave been discovered in Godric\u2019s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months \nago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of \ninjuries inflicted by Dark Magic. \n\n\u201cListeners, I\u2019d like to invite you now to join us in a minute\u2019s silence in memory of \nTed Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less \nregretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\u201d \n\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned \nto hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had \nfelt fully connected to the outside world for a long time. \n\n\f\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lee\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd now we can return to regular contributor \nRoyal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring. \n\n\u201cKingsley!\u201d burst out Ron. \n\n\u201cWe know!\u201d said Hermione, hushing him. \n\n\u201cMuggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to \nsustain heavy casualties,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cHowever, we continue to hear truly \ninspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle \nfriends and neighbors, often without the Muggles\u2019 knowledge. I\u2019d like to appeal to all our \nlisteners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any \nMuggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are \ntaken.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these \ndangerous times, it should be \u2018Wizards first\u2019? asked Lee. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that it\u2019s one short step from \u2018Wizards first\u2019 to \u2018Purebloods first,\u2019 and then \nto \u2018Death Eaters,\u2019\u201d replied Kingsley. \u201cWe\u2019re all human, aren\u2019t we? Every human life is \nworth the same, and worth saving.\u201d \n\n\u201cExcellently put, Royal, and you\u2019ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever \nget out of this mess,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd now, over to Romulus for our popular feature \u2018Pals \nof Potter.\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but \nHermione forestalled him in a whisper. \n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s Lupin!\u201d \n\n\u201cRomulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you\u2019ve appeared on our \nprogram, that Harry Potter is still alive?\u201d \n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cThere is no doubt at all in my mind that his death \nwould be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, \nbecause it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. \n\u2018The Boy Who Lived\u2019 remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the \ntriumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\u201d \n\nA mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, \nthen, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met? \n\n\u201cAnd what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him we\u2019re all with him in spirit,\u201d said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \n\u201cAnd I\u2019d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\u201d \n\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. \n\n\u201cNearly always right,\u201d she repeated. \n\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Ron in surprise. \u201cBill told me Lupin\u2019s living with \nTonks again! And apparently she\u2019s getting pretty big too\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter\u2019s who are suffering for \ntheir allegiance?\u201d Lee was saying. \n\n \u201cWell, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of \nHarry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile \neditor of The Quibbler,\u201d said Lupin. \n\n \u201cAt least he\u2019s still alive!\u201d muttered Ron. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\u201d \u2013", "PPL": 6.452295780181885, "PPL/lower": 0.9715995797221465, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019272090143912439, "Min-5%": 34.128336326748716, "Min-10%": 28.00870590583951, "Min-20%": 21.545361136457448, "Min-30%": 17.63197032481141, "Min-40%": 14.864408779843803, "Min-50%": 12.638060007393651, "Min-60%": 10.732853300602505}, {"text": "side pocket. And when you\u2019re dressed, there\u2019s luggage in the other sack.\u201d \n\n The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever \nseen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers \nrummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own \nthings away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all \nbegan stripping off with impunity, clearly more at ease with displaying his body than \nthey would have been with their own. \n\n \u201cI knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\u201d said Ron, looking down at his bare \nchest. \n\n \u201cHarry, your eyesight really is awful,\u201d said Hermione, as she put on glasses. \n\n Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a \nstuffed snowy owl, from the second sack. \n\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden \nHarrys faced him. \u201cThe pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, \nby broom \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cWhy\u2019m I with you?\u201d grunted the Harry nearest the back door. \n\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re the one that needs watching,\u201d growled Moody, and sure enough, \nhis magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \u201cArthur and Fred \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m George,\u201d said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \u201cCan\u2019t you even tell \nus apart when we\u2019re Harry?\u201d \n\n \u201cSorry, George \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cI\u2019m only yanking your wand, I\u2019m Fred really \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cEnough messing around!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cThe other one \u2013 George or Fred or \nwhoever you are \u2013 you\u2019re with Remus.

That all righ\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be on the bike, brooms an\u2019 thestrals can\u2019t take me weight, see. Not a lot o\u2019 room \non the seat with me on it, though, so you\u2019ll be in the sidecar.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Harry, not altogether truthfully. \n\n \u201cWe think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\u201d said Moody, who \nseemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \u201cSnape\u2019s had plenty of time to tell them \neverything about you he\u2019s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, \nwe\u2019re betting they\u2019ll choose one of the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All \nright then,\u201d he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters\u2019 clothes in it and leading \n\n\f\nthe way back to the door, \u201cI make it three minutes until we\u2019re supposed to leave. No \npoint locking the back door, it won\u2019t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. \nCome on \u2026\u201d \n\n Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig\u2019s cage and followed \nthe group to the dark back garden. \n\n On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been \nhelped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid \nwas standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on. \n\n \u201cIs this it? Is this Sirius\u2019s bike?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe very same,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \u201cAn\u2019 the last time yeh \nwas on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\u201d \n\n Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It \nplaced him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting \nthere like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his \nfeet and rammed Hedwig\u2019s cage between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. \n\n \u201cArthur\u2019s done a bit o\u2019 tinkerin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry\u2019s \ndiscomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank \ninches into the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s got a few tricks up its sleeves now. Tha\u2019 one was my idea.\u201d \nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer. \n\n\"Please be careful, Hagrid.\" said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, \nholding his broomstick. \"I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be \nused in emergencies.\" \n\n\"All right, then.\" said Moody. \"Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at \nexactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion's lost.\" \n\nEverybody motioned their heads. \n\n\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at \nLupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike \ninto life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. \n\n \u201cGood luck, everyone,\u201d shouted Moody. \u201cSee you all in about an hour at the \nBurrow. On the count of three. One \u2026 two .. THREE.\u201d \n\n There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty \nlurch. He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off \nhis face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral \nflicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig\u2019s cage and his rucksack, were \nalready sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to \ntake a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. By the time he looked over the edge of \nthe sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. \n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty \nhooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the \nOrder members had risen, oblivious \u2013 \n\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the \nmotorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, \nyells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, \nand his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees \u2013 \n\n\"No \u2013 HELP!\" \n\n\f\nThe broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack \nand the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, \nand then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. \n\n\"No \u2013 NO!\" \n\nThe motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering \nas Hagrid blasted through their circle. \n\n\"Hedwig \u2013 Hedwig \u2013\" \n\nBut the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage.

He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. \"How're you feeling?\"\n\u3000\u3000It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.\n\u3000\u3000\"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We thought you'd died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione made a small, squeaky noise.

The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.\n\u3000\u3000\"We didn't -- lose?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened.

But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.\n\u3000\u3000After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll come and see you later,\" Fred told him. \"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.\"\n\u3000\u3000The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore was really angry,\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.

Everyone thought you were --\"\n\u3000\u3000His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did someone get my Nimbus?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,\" said Hermione hesitantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\n\u3000\u3000\"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It -- it doesn't like being hit.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice.\n\u3000\u3000Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TEN\n\u3000\u3000THE MARAUDER'S MAP\n\u3000\u3000Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends.\n\u3000\u3000He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame\n\u3000\u3000him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him.\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?\n\u3000\u3000And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them.

When they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \"C'min.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Spect it's a record,\" he said thickly, when he recognized them. \"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!\" gasped Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not yet,\" said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard. \"But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How is he?\" said Ron as they all sat down. \"It wasn't serious, was it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,\" said Hagrid dully, \"but he's sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..\n\u3000\u3000\"He's faking it, \" said Harry at once. \"Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's worth.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course,\" said Hagrid miseribly. \"They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all my fault....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!\" said Hermione earnestly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're witnesses,\" said Harry. \"You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell Dumbledore what really happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,\" said Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.\n\u3000\u3000\"At, maybe she's right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud splash.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's he done?\" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the empty tankard.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stuck his head in the water barrel,\" said Hermione, putting the tankard away.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better,\" he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all. \"Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he'd only just realized he was there.\n\u3000\u3000\"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?\" he roared, so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air. \"YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER DARK, HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I'm takin' yer all back up ter school, an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm not worth that!\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER SEVEN\n\u3000\u3000THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.\n\u3000\u3000\"How is it, Draco?\" simpered Pansy Parkinson. \"Does it hurt much?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Settle down, settle down,\" said Professor Snape idly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said \"settle down\" if they'd walked in late, he'd have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his own students above all others.\n\u3000\u3000They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir,\" Malfoy called, \"sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him,\" said Snape without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000Ron went brick red.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's nothing wrong with your arm,\" he hissed at Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy smirked across the table.\n\u3000\u3000\"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor,\" drawled Malfoy, \"Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But, sit --!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\n\u3000\u3000Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,\" said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,\" said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.\n\u3000\u3000Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.\n\u3000\u3000\"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\" he asked them quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"None of your business,\" said Ron jerkily, without looking up.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer,\" said Malfoy", "PPL": 4.698977947235107, "PPL/lower": 0.919365241015836, "PPL/zlib": 0.0015336089906119801, "Min-5%": 28.9099604288737, "Min-10%": 23.27326552073161, "Min-20%": 17.52991186668937, "Min-30%": 14.064406724240182, "Min-40%": 11.493102835851078, "Min-50%": 9.389720812876902, "Min-60%": 7.832474896085148}, {"text": "s face. \"Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence \n\n\f\nand insubordination?

He seemed to regret his loss of temper. \n\n\"It \u2013 it was nothing,\" he growled. \"I \u2026 regret your attitude,\" he said, looking \nHarry full in the face once more. \"You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire \nwhat you \u2013 what Dumbledore \u2013 desired. We ought to work together.\" \n\n\"I don't like your methods, Minister,\" said Harry. \"Remember?\" \n\nFor the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar \nthat still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's \nexpression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. \nMrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or \nso she called, \"He's gone!\" \n\nWhat did he want?\" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and \nHermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them. \n\n\"To give us what Dumbledore left us,\" said Harry. \"They've only just released the \ncontent of his will.\" \n\nOutside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had \ngiven them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator \nand The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to \npass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore \nwould have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the \nthird of fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully \nhungry we didn't like to start without you\u2026 Shall I serve dinner now?\" \n\nThey all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" \nand much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding \nthe following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set \nup a tent for himself in a neighboring field. \n\n\"Meet us upstairs,\" Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. \nWeasley restore the garden to its normal state. \"After everyone's gone to bed.\" \n\nUp in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's \nmokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless \nthough some of them were the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, \nand R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then \nsat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped \non the door and tiptoed inside. \n\n\"Muffiato,\" she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. \n\n\"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?\" said Ron. \n\n\"Times change,\" said Hermione. \"Now, show us that Deluminator.\" \n\n\f\nRon obliged at once. Holding I up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp \nthey had lit went out at once. \n\n\"The thing is,\" whispered Hermione through the dark, \"we could have achieved \nthat with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\" \n\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the \nceiling and illuminated them all once more. \n\n\"Still, it's cool,\" said Ron, a little defensively. \"And from what they said, \nDumbledore invented it himself!\" \n\n\"I know but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us \nturn out the lights!\" \n\n\"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine \neverything he'd left us?\" asked Harry. \n\n\"Definitely,\" said Hermione. \"He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving \nus these things, but that will doesn't explain\u2026\" \n\n\"\u2026 why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?\" asked Ron. \n\n\"Well, exactly,\" said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the \nBard. \"If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the \nMinistry, you'd think he'd have left us know why\u2026 unless he thought it was obvious?\" \n\n\"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?\" said Ron. \"I always said he was mental. \nBrilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch \u2013 what the hell was \nthat about?\" \n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Hermione. \"When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was \nso sure that something was going to happen!\" \n\n\"Yeah, well,\" said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \n\"I wasn't going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione. \n\n\"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\" said Harry. \"Don't you \nremember?\" \n\nHermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically \nfrom Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice. \n\n\"That was the one you nearly swallowed!\" \n\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the \nSnitch. \n\nIt did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He \nlowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. \n\n\"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!\" \nHe nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. \nEngraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, \nwere five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry recognized as \nDumbledore's \n\nI open at the close. \n\nHe had barely read them when the words vanished again. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026.\" What's that supposed to mean?\" \n\nHermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. \n\n\"I open at the close\u2026 at the close\u2026 I open at the close\u2026\" \n\n\f\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, \nthey were unable to wring any more meaning from them. \n\n\"And the sword,\" said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts \nto divine meaning in the Snitch's inscription. \n\n\"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?\" \n\n\"And why couldn't he just have told me?\" Harry said quietly. \"I was there, it was \nright there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have \nit, why didn't he just give it to me then?\" \n\nHe felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to \nhave been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive.

The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with \nbathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully \nonto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter \nstill, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not \nspeak for a while. \n\n \u201cI\u2019ll make some tea,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from \nthe depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen. \n\n\f\n Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that \nMad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After \na minute or two, Ron broke the silence. \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?\u201d \n\n \u201cWith any luck, they\u2019ll have got away,\u201d said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for \ncomfort. \u201cAs long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he\u2019ll have transported Mrs. \nCattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they\u2019ll be fleeing the country right now with \ntheir children. That\u2019s what Harry told her to do.\u201d \n\n \u201cBlimey, I hope they escaped,\u201d said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea \nseemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the feeling \nReg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me \nwhen I was him.

Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the \nCattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if \nhe had surprised her in the act of kissing him. \n\n \u201cSo, have you got it?\u201d Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there. \n\n \u201cGot \u2013 got what?\u201d she said with a little start. \n\n \u201cWhat did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where\u2019s the locket?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou got it?\u201d shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. \u201cNo one \ntells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!\u201d \n\u201cWell, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren\u2019t we?\u201d said \nHermione. \u201cHere.\u201d \n\n And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. \n\n It was as large as a chicken\u2019s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green \nstones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent\u2019s canvas roof. \n\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t any chance someone\u2019s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?\u201d asked \nRon hopefully. \u201cI mean, are we sure it\u2019s still a Horcrux?\u201d \n\n \u201cI think so,\u201d said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. \n\u201cThere\u2019d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.\u201d \n\n She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, \npristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the \nHorcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. \n\n \u201cI reckon Kreacher\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work out how to \nopen this thing before we can destroy it.\u201d \n\n Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden \ndoors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to \nfling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with \nhis fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus\u2019s bedroom \ndoor. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom \ndid their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been. \n\n \u201cCan you feel it, though?\u201d Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his \nclenched fist. \n\n\f\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d \nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew \nwhat Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or \nwas it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart? \n\n \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d Hermione asked. \n\n \u201cKeep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.\u201d Harry replied, and, little though \nhe wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight \nbeneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given \nhim. \n\n \u201cI think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,\u201d he added to \nHermione, standing up and stretching. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need to think about some food as well. \nYou stay there,\u201d he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of \ngreen. \n\n With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully \nupon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role \nof lookout.

I don't know why you don't chuck it, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn't mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could've been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.WL.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would've done everyone a favor .....\n\u3000\u3000But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione's face that she was thinking what he was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn't it?\" he said. \"That's what Malfoy said.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . .\" said Ron slowly.\n\u3000\u3000\"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000*232*\n\u3000\u3000a so?\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary.\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered.\n\u3000\u3000She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\"\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said.\n\u3000\u3000She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though\n\u3000\u3000* 233 *\n\u3000\u3000Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\n\u3000\u3000Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.\n\u3000\u3000\"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.\n\u3000\u3000The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.\n\u3000\u3000\"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243 *\n\u3000\u3000Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years ....\n\u3000\u3000Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . .\" now with a dance routine to match.\n\u3000\u3000Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He tapped his nose again and strode off.\n\u3000\u3000Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late- running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors.\n\u3000\u3000The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\n\u3000\u3000* 235*\n\u3000\u3000still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling.

Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid's record's against him. Ministry's got to do something - the school governors have been in touch -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \"I'm under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn't Hagrid, he'll be back and no more said. But I've got to take him. Got to. Wouldn't be doing my duty -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid's eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you'll be let out with a full apology -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry's turn for an elbow in the ribs; he'd let out an audible gasp.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid's hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\n\u3000\u3000\"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doin' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn't it? At this rate, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, \"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now\n\u3000\u3000262\n\u3000\u3000\"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted -\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\n\u3000\u3000'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But -\" stuttered Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\"growled Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones.\n\u3000\u3000\"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will\n\u3000\u3000* 26$*\n\u3000\u3000ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\n\u3000\u3000* 265*\n\u3000\u3000that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\n\u3000\u3000Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\n\u3000\u3000One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever\n\u3000\u3000*266*\n\u3000\u3000had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed.

Yes, I'm coming, Penny!\" And-he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\" said a cold, drawling voice.\n\u3000\u3000Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?\" said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in case you get too near a dementor.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then it could catch the Snitch for you.\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's broom really was a Firebolt.\n\u3000\u3000At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what we've got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just -- just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?\" interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information -- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Jordan!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal...\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show her your acceleration, Harry!\" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\n\u3000\u3000Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers.\n\u3000\u3000Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet away --\n\u3000\u3000Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\n\u3000\u3000There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn -- Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance is really noticeable in these long --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --\n\u3000\u3000Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\" Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him.... She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to take the consequences....\n\u3000\u3000He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.\n\u3000\u3000He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second -- then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\n\u3000\u3000Distracted, Harry looked down.\n\u3000\u3000Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him.\n\u3000\u3000He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum!\"\n\u3000\u3000Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\n\u3000\u3000Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom.

That's a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I wasn't paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm \"\n\u3000\u3000\"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully.\n\u3000\u3000* IL 56*\n\u3000\u3000Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle .... Come on, let's go.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle's gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.\n\u3000\u3000\"RON!\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's a girls' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get - away - from - there -\" Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don't you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why shouldn't we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now\n\u3000\u3000*157*\n\u3000\u3000reddening. \"You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!\"\n\u3000\u3000And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron's ears.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry's surprise, Hermione followed suit.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who'd want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you're talking about Malfoy -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - `You'll be next, Mudbloods!'- come on, you've only got to look at his foul rat face to know it's him -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he's always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin's descendants. His father's definitely evil enough.\"\n\u3000\u3000*158*\n\u3000\u3000\"They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\" said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it's possible ......\n\u3000\u3000\"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We'd be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won't you?\" said Ron irritably.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron.\n\u3000", "PPL": 0.12062327563762665, "PPL/lower": 0.15489601219008803, "PPL/zlib": 3.824453888320439e-05, "Min-5%": 2.407187829597616, "Min-10%": 1.2069288423323694, "Min-20%": 0.6029485521721654, "Min-30%": 0.4024863011670602, "Min-40%": 0.3016732306636306, "Min-50%": 0.24123790811757184, "Min-60%": 0.20113476066720565}, {"text": "raco how to do it.

The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure- blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.\n\u3000\u3000\"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib.\"\n\u3000\u3000In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\n\u3000\u3000Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still\n\u3000\u3000* 3-85*\n\u3000\u3000needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.\n\u3000\u3000\"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.\n\u3000\u3000\"I think Id better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\n\u3000\u3000Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape's Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\n\u3000\u3000Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione's signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery\n\u3000\u3000*186*\n\u3000\u3000potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded.\n\u3000\u3000Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle's cauldron.\n\u3000\u3000Goyle's potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape's desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\n\u3000\u3000When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle's cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\n\u3000\u3000*187*\n\u3000\u3000\"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.\n\u3000\u3000\"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. \"I could tell.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Snape can't prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can he do?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.\n\u3000\u3000A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days ......\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \"Shall we go?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that\n\u3000\u3000*188*\n\u3000\u3000evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead.

Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked \naround, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the \nCloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth \nbleeding, utterly bemused. \n\"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two- \nfaced bastard!\" Ron yelled. \nThere were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall. Death \nEaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, \nin combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley \nright beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying \nor dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell \ntoward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, \nwho had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous \nTentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death \nEater and began reeling him in. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sped won the marble staircase: glass \nshattered on the left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had \nrecorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that \npeople slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the \nbalcony overhead as they reached the ground a gray blur that Harry \ntook for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its \nteeth into one of the fallen. \n\"NO!\" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, \nFenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly struggling body \nof Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to \nreturn to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a \ncrystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground \nand did not move. \n\"I have more!\" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the \nbanisters. \"More for any who want them! Here--\" \nAnd with a move likea tennis serve, she heaved another enormous \ncrystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and \ncaused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a \nwindow. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst \nopen, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the \nfront hall. \nScreams of terror rent the air: the fighters scattered, Death \nEaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew \n\n\f\ninto the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and \nreared, more terrifying than ever. \n\"How do we get out?\" yelled ron over all the screaming, but before \neither Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside; \nHagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery \npink umbrella. \n\"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!\" he yelled. \n\"HAGRID, NO!\" \nHarry forgot everything else: he sprinted out from under the cloak, \nrunning bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. \n\"HAGRID, COME BACK!\" \nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid \nvanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul \nswarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, \nHagrid buried in their midst. \n\"HAGRID!\" Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend \nor foe he did not care: He was springint down the front steps into \nthe dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their \nprey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. \n\"HAGRID!\" \nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist \nof the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way \nwas impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the \ndarkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked \nup: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head ihidden in \nshadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light \nfrom the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed \na massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon \nHarryk, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \n\"Oh my--!\" shrieked Hermione, as she and ron caught up with Harry \nand gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through \nthe window above. \n\"DON'T!\" ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her \nwand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle--\" \n\"HAGGER?\" \nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only dnow did \nHarry realzie that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The \ngargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors \nturned around and let out a rorar. The stone steps tremebled as he \nstomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell \nopen, showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they \nlaunched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \n\"RUN!\" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows \nas the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down \nthe steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not \nlost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they \n\n\f\nwere halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short \nagain. \nThe air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and \nsolidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling \nfigures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards \nthe castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... \nron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting \nbehind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only \ndementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and \nFred was gone, and Hagrid was suurely dying or already dead... \n\"come on, Harry!\" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away.

Maybe he is, maybe he isn\u2019t, but the fact remains he can \nmove faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\u2019t \n\n\f\ncount on him being a long way away if you\u2019re planning to take any risks. I never thought \nI\u2019d hear myself say it, but safety first!\u201d \n\n \u201cThank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\u201d said Lee. \u201dListeners, that \nbrings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don\u2019t know when it will be possible to \nbroadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The \nnext password will be \u2018Mad-Eye.\u2019 Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\u201d \n\n The radio\u2019s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, \nRon, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an \nextraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten \nthat other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep. \n\n \u201cGood, eh?\u201d said Ron happily. \n\n \u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s so brave of them,\u201d sighed Hermione admiringly. \u201cIf they were found \u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, they keep on the move, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cLike us.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut did you hear what Fred said?\u201d asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was \nover, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \u201cHe\u2019s abroad! He\u2019s \nstill looking for the Wand, I knew it!\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry\u2014\u201c \n\n \u201cCome on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHARRY, NO!\u201d \n\n \u201c\u2014demort\u2019s after the Elder Wand!\u201d \n\n \u201cThe name\u2019s Taboo!\u201d Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded \noutside the tent. \u201cI told you, Harry, I told you, we can\u2019t say it anymore \u2013 we\u2019ve got to put \nthe protection back around us \u2013 quickly \u2013 it\u2019s how they find \u2013\u201c \n\n But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had \nlit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited \nvoices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out. \n\n \u201cCome out of there with your hands up!\u201d came a rasping voice through the \ndarkness. \u201cWe know you\u2019re in there! You\u2019ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and \nwe don\u2019t care who we curse!\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Three \n\nMalfoy Manor \n\n \n\nHarry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw \nHermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a \nburst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face \nswelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him. \n\n \"Get up, vermin.\" \n\n Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, \nsomeone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry \nclutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, \ntight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His \n\n\f\neyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he \nwas bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five \npeople wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too. \n\n \"Get -- off - her!\" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles \nhitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, \"No! Leave him alone, leave \nhim alone!\" \n\n \"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list,\" \nsaid the horribly familiar, rasping voice. \"Delicious girl... what a treat . . . I do enjoy the \nsoftness of the skin. . . .\" \n\n Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the \nwerewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery. \n\n \"Search the tent!\" said another voice. \n\n Harry was thrown face", "PPL": 7.723469257354736, "PPL/lower": 0.9876835371330553, "PPL/zlib": 0.002281674817534634, "Min-5%": 38.3925661947213, "Min-10%": 32.14782964482027, "Min-20%": 25.243352803740933, "Min-30%": 20.83274505037438, "Min-40%": 17.5966683331795, "Min-50%": 14.975158727763336, "Min-60%": 12.81882916774346}, {"text": "Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's going to be okay.

As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties,\" Snape was saying. \"The Kiss will be performed immediately?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peeves!\" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. \"In here!\"\n\u3000\u3000They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he's horrible,\" whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. \"I bet he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius....\" She checked her watch. \"Three minutes, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before Dumbledore locks the door?\" Harry panted.\n\u3000\u3000I don't want to think about it!\" Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. \"One minute!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance. \"Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,\" said Hermione tensely. \"Come on, Harry!\"\n\u3000\u3000They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back appeared.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am going to lock you in,\" they heard him saying. \"it is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache. \"Well?\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We did it!\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak....\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore beamed at them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well done. I think --\" He listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing. \"Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock you in --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?\"\n\u3000\u3000She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them....\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\n\u3000\u3000Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing nearer --\n\u3000\u3000\"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE!

Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Snape!\" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. \"Control yourself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door's been locked, we just saw --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!\" Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You're talking nonsense!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That will do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course not!\" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. \"I would have heard them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, there you have it, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fellow seems quite unbalanced,\" said Fudge, staring after him. \"I'd watch out for him", "PPL": 5.1431169509887695, "PPL/lower": 0.914799287185997, "PPL/zlib": 0.0016612134854614889, "Min-5%": 32.1854658313826, "Min-10%": 25.843315105812223, "Min-20%": 19.45155426342505, "Min-30%": 15.460382866160488, "Min-40%": 12.582431423052016, "Min-50%": 10.277217395975093, "Min-60%": 8.572848090216372}, {"text": "over toward him, \neyes opening in a skull of a face. . . .

If that is Harry Potter, he will know.\u201d \n\n The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost \nclosed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung \nfrom the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from \nchairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by \nthe Snatchers. \n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n\n The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry\u2019s ears. He \nwas panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to \nblock out Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. \n\n \u201cThey say they\u2019ve got Potter,\u201d said Narcissa\u2019s cold voice. \u201cDraco, come here.\u201d \nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly \ntaller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath \nwhite-blond hair. \n\n Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath \nthe chandelier. \n\n \u201cWell, boy?\u201d rasped the werewolf. \n\n Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately \nscrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time \nsince leaving Grimmauld Place. \n\n His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione\u2019s jinx. \nHis black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he \nnot known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his \nglasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still \navoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached. \n\n \u201cWell, Draco?\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. \u201cIs it? Is it Harry Potter?\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure,\u201d said Draco. He was keeping his distance from \nGreyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him. \n\n\f\n \u201cBut look at him carefully, look! Come closer!\u201d \n\n Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. \n\n \u201cDraco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will \nbe forgiv \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cNow, we won\u2019t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?\u201d said \nGreyback menacingly. \n\n \u201cOf course not, of course not!\u201d said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry \nhimself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail \neven through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was \npeering out from between the bars of a cage. \n\n \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Lucius asked Greyback. \u201cHow did he get into this \nstate?\u201d \n\n \u201cThat wasn\u2019t us.\u201d \n\u201cLooks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,\u201d said Lucius. \n\n His gray eyes raked Harry\u2019s forehead. \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s something there,\u201d he whispered. \u201cit could be the scar, stretched \ntight. . . .\u201d Draco, come here, look properly!

If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here \nfor nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat about the Mudblood, then?\u201d growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown \noff his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light \nfell on Hermione instead. \n\n \u201cWait,\u201d said Narcissa sharply. \u201cYes \u2013 yes, she was in Madam Malkin\u2019s with \nPotter!

Look, Draco, isn\u2019t it the Granger girl?\u201d \n\n \u201cI . . . maybe . . . yeah.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut then, that\u2019s the Weasley boy!\u201d shouted Lucius, striding around the bound \nprisoners to face Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s them, Potter\u2019s friends \u2013 Draco, look at him, isn\u2019t it Arthur \nWeasley\u2019s son, what\u2019s his name \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. \u201cIt could be.\u201d \n\n The drawing room door opened behind Harry.

Could try clearing it? Might \nbring the place down.\" \n\"You lying piece of filth.\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \n\"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, \ndid you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \n\"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!\" \n\"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, \nand he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body \nin its shadow. \n\"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \n\"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna, \njust let me have Luna...\" \n\"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and \nbring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice \nwaiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to \nbury.\" \nXenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. \nXenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \n\n\f\n\"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" \nHe started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the \nstaircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they \ncould, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off \nhis legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione \nmanaged to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \n\"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs \nbegin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \n\"Do you trust me Harry?\" \nHarry nodded. \n\"Okay then.\" Hermione whispered. \"give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to \nput it on.\" \n\"Me? But Harry --\" \n\"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder.\" \nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking \nthe stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry \ndid not know what Hermione was waiting for. \n\"Hold tight\" she whispered. \"Hold tight...any second...\" \nXenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \n\"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath \nthem. \"Deprimo!\" \nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still \nholding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two \nmen trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained \nall around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of \nthe collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness. \n\n \n\nChapter Twenty-Two \n\nThe Deathly Hallows \n\n \n\n Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have \nlanded in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around \nthem, waving her wand. \n\n \u201cProtego Totalum\u2026Salvio Hexia\u2026\u201d \n\n \u201cThat treacherous old bleeder.\u201d Ron panted, emerging from beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \u201cHermione you\u2019re a genius, a total genius.

Fantastic stuff: There\u2019s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it\u2019s \ncalled, the most magnificent battery, and it\u2019ll be a great opportunity to find out how \nbrakes work.

Oh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the \nroom. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was \njust as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that Hermione was now sitting \nin the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of \nwhich Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles. \n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. \n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to get away?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, Ron\u2019s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets \nyesterday,\u201d said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and \nThe Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other. \n\n\u201cWe were just talking about Mad-Eye,\u201d Ron told Harry. \u201cI reckon he might have \nsurvived.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cYeah, but Bill was under attack too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow can he be sure what he \nsaw?\u201d \n\n\u201cEven if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\u201d said \nHermione, now weight Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. \n\n\u201cHe could have used a Shield Charm \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cFleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,\u201d said Harry. \n\n\u201cWell, all right, if you want him to be dead,\u201d said Ron grumpily, punching his \npillow into a more comfortable shape. \n\n\u201cOf course we don\u2019t want him to be dead!\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s \ndreadful that he\u2019s dead! But we\u2019re being realistic!\u201d \n\nFor the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye\u2019s body, broken as Dumbledore\u2019s had \nbeen, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed \nwith a bizarre desire to laugh. \n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that\u2019s why no one\u2019s found \nhim,\u201d said Ron wisely. \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in \nHagrid\u2019s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him \u2013\u201c \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her \nburst into tears over her copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary. \n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \u201cHermione, I \nwasn\u2019t trying to upset \u2013\u201c \n\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got \nthere first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a \nrevolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily \npulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, \u201cTergeo.\u201d \n\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, \nRon handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. \n\n\u201cOh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I\u2019m sorry. . . .\u201d She blew her nose and hiccupped. \u201cIt\u2019s \njust so awf-ful, isn\u2019t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye \ndying, somehow, he seemed so tough!\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ron, giving her a squeeze. \u201cBut you know what he\u2019d say to \nus if he was here?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2019C-constant vigilance,\u2019\u201d said Hermione, mopping her eyes. \n\n\f\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019d tell us to learn from what happened to \nhim. And what I\u2019ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\u201d \n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A \nsecond later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped \nThe Monster of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt \nand snapped viciously at Ron\u2019s ankle. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Herm", "PPL": 6.608957290649414, "PPL/lower": 0.9294102263377383, "PPL/zlib": 0.002063364748875871, "Min-5%": 33.4225876939063, "Min-10%": 27.933198227601892, "Min-20%": 21.353369925016295, "Min-30%": 17.569655429268504, "Min-40%": 14.911662029462223, "Min-50%": 12.809715253283667, "Min-60%": 10.98252533832474}, {"text": ".

Harry\u2019s wand was now so close to the bridge of \nMundungus\u2019s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. \n\n \u201cWhen you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\u201d Harry began, but \nMundungus interrupted him again. \n\n \u201cSirius never cared about any of the junk \u2013\u201d \n\n There was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, \nand a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head \nwith a saucepan. \n\n \u201cCall \u2018im off, call \u2018im off, \u2018e should be locked up!\u201d screamed Mundungus, \ncowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again. \n\n \u201cKreacher, no!\u201d shouted Harry. \n\n Kreacher\u2019s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft. \n\n \u201cPerhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\u201d \n\n Ron laughed. \n\n\f\n \u201cWe need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the \nhonors,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cThank you very much, Master,\u201d said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a \nshort distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. \n\n \u201cWhen you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\u201d Harry began \nagain, \u201cyou took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard.

Bow on top of \u2018er head.\u201d \n\n He frowned and then added, \u201cLooked like a toad.\u201d \n\n Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into \nhis eyebrows, which ignited. \n\n \u201cAquamenti!\u201d screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, \nengulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus. \n\n Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces. \nThe scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again. \n\n \n\nChapter Twelve \n\nMagic is Might \n\n \n\n As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld \nPlace shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number \ntwelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve \nitself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing \nmistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen. \n\n And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the \nanomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in \nGrimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings \nfacing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The \nlurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike \n\n\f\nfor normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric \ndressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, \nwondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. \n\n The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. \nOccasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something \ninteresting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed. \n\n On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than \never before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at \nhouses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared \nelusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first \ntime in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to \nhave seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest \ncompanion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed \ninto their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed. \n\n Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly \nlost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought \nthat the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. \nShutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped \nit over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the \nbasement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand. \n\n The usual low whisper of \u201cSeverus", "PPL": 6.518441677093506, "PPL/lower": 0.9909730463619798, "PPL/zlib": 0.001973491273718894, "Min-5%": 33.11985376769421, "Min-10%": 27.596916582070143, "Min-20%": 21.301259584123756, "Min-30%": 17.48085401733846, "Min-40%": 14.770941915022423, "Min-50%": 12.63313672269894, "Min-60%": 10.812376410060287}, {"text": "rible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.\n\u3000\u3000Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice.\n\u3000\u3000It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving off,\" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch. \"Check who's in there, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione peered around the classroom door.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin was back at work.

His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?\" Lupin asked, frowning slightly.\n\u3000\u3000The babble broke out again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- two rolls of parchment!\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the essay.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I've already finished it!\"\n\u3000\u3000They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless looking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes. \"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people follow the light -- then --\"\n\u3000\u3000The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but --\n\u3000\u3000\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's box with a cloth.\n\u3000\u3000\"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you hear about the dementors too?\" said Harry with difficulty.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked at him quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the reason you fell?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself.\" Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have.\"\n\u3000\u3000A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When they get near me --\" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat tight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Why did they have to come to the match?\" said Harry bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000\"They're getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions running high... it was their idea of a feast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got away...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"There are -- certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What defenses?\" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them --\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said, \"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next term, I'm afraid.

K. Rowling \n\n\f\n Chapter One \nThe Dark Lord Ascending \n\n\nThe two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit \nlane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, \nrecognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking \nbriskly in the same direction. \n\"News?\" asked the taller of the two. \n\"The best,\" replied Severus Snape. \nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, \nneatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they \nmarched. \n\"Thought I might be late,\" said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as \nthe branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \"It was a little trickier than I \nexpected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be \ngood?\" \nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led \noff the lane. The high hedge curved into them, running off into the distance beyond the \npair of imposing wrought-iron gates barring the men\u2019s way. Neither of them broke step: \nIn silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as \nthough the dark metal was smoke. \n\n The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\u2019s footsteps. There was a rustle \nsomewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion\u2019s \nhead, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, \nstrutting majestically along the top of the hedge. \n\n \u201cHe always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks \u2026\u201d Yaxley thrust his wand back \nunder his cloak with a snort. \n\n A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, \nlights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden \nbeyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and \nYaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though \nnobody had visibly opened it. \n\n The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent \ncarpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall \nfollowed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden \ndoor leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned \nthe bronze handle. \n\n The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The \nroom\u2019s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination \ncame from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded \nmirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew \naccustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the \nscene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, \nrevolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in \nthe bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this \n\n\f\nsingular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below \nit. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so. \n\n \u201cYaxley. Snape,\u201d said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \u201cYou are \nvery nearly late.\u201d \n\n The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at \nfirst, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, \nhowever, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and \ngleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a \npearly glow. \n\n \u201cSeverus, here,\u201d said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \n\u201cYaxley \u2013 beside Dolohov.\u201d \n\n The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table \nfollowed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first. \n\n \u201cSo?\u201d \n\n \u201cMy Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current \nplace of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\u201d \n\n The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, \nall gazing at Snape and Voldemort. \n\n \u201cSaturday \u2026 at nightfall,\u201d repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon \nSnape\u2019s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently \nfearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, \nhowever, looked calmly back into Voldemort\u2019s face and, after a moment or two, \nVoldemort\u2019s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile. \n\n \u201cGood. Very good. And this information comes \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201c \u2013 from the source we discussed,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cMy Lord.\u201d \n\n Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. \nAll faces turned to him. \n\n \u201cMy Lord, I have heard differently.\u201d \n\n Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \u201cDawlish, the Auror, \nlet slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns \nseventeen.\u201d \n\n Snape was smiling. \n\n \u201cMy source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No \ndoubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; \nhe is known to be susceptible.\u201d \n\n \u201cI assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\u201d said Yaxley. \n\n \u201cIf he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI assure you, \nYaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The \nOrder believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe Order\u2019s got one thing right, then, eh?\u201d said a squat man sitting a short \ndistance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the \ntable. \n\n Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving \nslowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. \n\n\f\n \u201cMy Lord,\u201d Yaxley went on, \u201cDawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be \nused to transfer the boy \u2013\u201c \n\n Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching \nresentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape. \n\n \u201cWhere are they going to hide the boy next?\u201d \n\n \u201cAt the home of one of the Order,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe place, according to the \nsource, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could \nprovide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, \nof course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the \nopportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, Yaxley?\u201d Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely \nin his", "PPL": 6.448397159576416, "PPL/lower": 0.9891568678838791, "PPL/zlib": 0.0019417034506402939, "Min-5%": 32.211399209265615, "Min-10%": 27.116677527334176, "Min-20%": 21.59853323864179, "Min-30%": 17.90001612455138, "Min-40%": 15.077327179733873, "Min-50%": 12.726121099813243, "Min-60%": 10.74074155158979}, {"text": "9\n\u3000\u3000A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.\n\u3000\u3000\"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF -- SMELL HIM.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk's head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous -\n\u3000\u3000It lunged blindly -- Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry's side. He raised the sword in both his hands -\n\u3000\u3000The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true -- Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent's mouth -\n\u3000\u3000But as warm blood drenched Harry's arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\n\u3000\u3000A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes . . . .\"\n\u3000\u30001,520\n\u3000\u3000He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent's fang had pierced him.\n\u3000\u3000He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore's bird knows it. Do you see what he's doing, Potter? He's crying.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Fawke's head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle's distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000If this is dying, thought Harry, it's not so bad.\n\u3000\u3000Even the pain was leaving him ....\n\u3000\u3000But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry's arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound -- except that there was no wound\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle's voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry's wand at\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Phoenix tears. - .\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry's arm. \"Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked into Harry's face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter ... you and me....\n\u3000\u3000He raised the wand\n\u3000\u3000Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry's lap -- the diary.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\n\u3000\u3000There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then\n\u3000\u3000He had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\n\u3000\u3000Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth.\n\u3000\u3000Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused\n\u3000\u30001,522\n\u3000\u3000eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry -- oh, Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy -- it was me, Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d- diddt mean to -- R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I r- remember is him coming out of the diary --\"\n\u3000\u3000\" It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I've looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I'll have to leave and -- w-what'll Mum and Dad say?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\n\u3000\u3000After a few minutes' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry's ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny's okay! I've got her!\"\n\u3000\u3000He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull\n\u3000\u3000321,3\n\u3000\u3000her through first. \"You're alive!

I've never seen a de-gnoming -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\"\n\u3000\u3000And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\n\u3000\u3000they crossed the lawn.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome.\n\u3000\u3000It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\n\u3000\u3000\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes.\"\n\u3000\u3000He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until\n\u3000\u3000\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ......\n\u3000\u3000The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\n\u3000\u3000\"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put.\"\n\u3000\u3000Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here .... Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, the front door slammed.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's back!\" said George. \"Dad's home!\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried through the garden and back into the house.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\n\u3000\u3000\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ......\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000\"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness ......\n\u3000\u3000\"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it .... Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face .... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\n\u3000\u3000\"C-cars, Molly, dear?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley blinked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth .... There's a loophole in the law, you'll find .... As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed!

The stone Pensieve lay in the \ncabinet where it had always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape\u2019s \nmemories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into \nsomeone else\u2019s head would be a blessed relief\u2026 Nothing that even Snape had left him \ncould be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, \n\n\f\nand without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would \nassuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. \n\n He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he \nstraightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge \nchimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, \nand a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was \noverlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a \nshabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt. \n\n Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, \nsallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the \nyounger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. \n\n \u201cLily, don\u2019t do it!\u201d shrieked the elder of the two. \n\n But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the \nair, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and \ninstead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through \nthe air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly. \n\n \u201cMummy told you not to!\u201d \n\n Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, \nmaking a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. \n\n \u201cMummy said you weren\u2019t allowed, Lily!\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Lily, still giggling. \u201cTuney, look at this. Watch what I can \ndo.\u201d \n\n Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, \nthough the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush \nbehind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and \ndisapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held \nout her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, \nmany-lipped oyster. \n\n \u201cStop it!\u201d shrieked Petunia. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not hurting you,\u201d said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and \nthrew it back to the ground. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower\u2019s flight to the \nground and lingered upon it. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she added, and there was definite \nlonging in her voice. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped \nout from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but \nLily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his \nappearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily. \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s obvious?\u201d asked Lily. \n\n Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now \nhovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cI know what you are.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re a witch,\u201d whispered Snape. \n\n She looked affronted. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\u201d \n\n She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did \nnot take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the \nsmock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self. \n\n The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the \nswing poles, as though it was the safe place in tag. \n\n \u201cYou are,\u201d said Snape to Lily. \u201cYou are a witch. I\u2019ve been watching you for a \nwhile. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My mum\u2019s one, and I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d \n\n Petunia\u2019s laugh was like cold water. \n\n \u201cWizard!\u201d she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from \nthe shock of his unexpected appearance. \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re that Snape boy! \nThey live down Spinner\u2019s End by the river,\u201d she told Lily, and it was evident from her \ntone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \u201cWhy have you been spying \non us?\u201d \n\n \u201cHaven\u2019t been spying,\u201d said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the \nbright sunlight. \u201cWouldn\u2019t spy on you, anyway,\u201d he added spitefully, \u201cyou\u2019re a Muggle.\u201d \n\n Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake \nthe tone. \n\n \u201cLily, come on, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, \nglaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the \nplayground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape\u2019s bitter \ndisappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, \nand that it had all gone wrong\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was \nnow in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. \nThe shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing \neach other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock \nlooked less pecular in the half light. \n\n \u201c\u2026and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get \nletters.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut I have done magic outside school!\u201d \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re all right. We haven\u2019t got wands yet. They let you off when you\u2019re a kid \nand you can\u2019t help it. But once you\u2019re eleven,\u201d he nodded importantly, \u201cand they start \ntraining you, then you\u2019ve got to go careful.\u201d \n\n There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, \nand Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, \nleaned in toward the boy, and said, \u201cIt is real, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not a joke? Petunia says you\u2019re \nlying to me. Petunia says there isn\u2019t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s real for us,\u201d said Snape. \u201cNot for her. But we\u2019ll get the letter, you and me.\u201d \n\n \u201cReally?\u201d whispered Lily. \n\n \u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he \nstruck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his \ndestiny. \n\n \u201cAnd will it really come by owl?\u201d Lily whispered. \n\n \u201cNormally,\u201d said Snape. \u201cBut you\u2019re Muggle-born, so someone from the school \nwill have to come and explain to your parents.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoes it make a difference, being Muggle-", "PPL": 6.789311408996582, "PPL/lower": 0.9847054172768823, "PPL/zlib": 0.002133661662161088, "Min-5%": 33.865361662472, "Min-10%": 28.48233647439994, "Min-20%": 22.25322179864263, "Min-30%": 18.256727706337596, "Min-40%": 15.425488002725801, "Min-50%": 13.191186808188057, "Min-60%": 11.281186271082694}, {"text": "\n\n\f\n \u201cThe one thing we\u2019ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re \nmoving you tonight.

It\u2019ll be the protectors \nwho have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\u2019ll want to kill them.\u201d \n\n Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling \nhalf a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before \npouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \n\n \u201cAltogether, then \u2026 \u201c \n\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.

I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\" he said evenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Ron. \"What's Scabbers got to do with it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What's my rat got to do with anything?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean -- of course he's a rat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, he's not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He's a wizard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\u3000\u3000MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS\n\u3000\u3000It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're both mental.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me... not this time, though!\"\n\u3000\u3000And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg.\n\u3000\u3000.\"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we've got to explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape.\n\u3000\u3000\"They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\"\n\u3000\u3000Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad bleeding hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\"\n\u3000\u3000He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\n\u3000\u3000There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?\n\u3000\u3000Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\n\u3000\u3000\"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only know how it began...\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one there...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\n\u3000\u3000He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then said, \"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf, None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I hadn't been so foolhardy...\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\n\u3000\u3000\"I as a very small boy when I received the bite.

The morning of the first of September was \ncrisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the \ngreat sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like \ncobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents \nwere pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed \nfearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's arm. \n\n \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \n\n \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" \n\n The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the \nbarrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the \nsurrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \n\n \"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!\" \n\n \"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny. \n\n \"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's \nnothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin\" \n\n But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the \nbarrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took \nthe trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \n\n \"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, \ncapitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \n\n \"Every day, of you want us to,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly, \"James says most people only get letters \nfrom home about once a month.\" \n\n \"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \n\n \"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry \nput in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" \n\n Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they \nreached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged \nonto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was \npouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the \nmist, into which James had already disappeared. \n\n \"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed \nas they made their way down the platform. \n\n \"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. \n\n But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. \nDetached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head \nPercy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not \n", "PPL": 6.760210037231445, "PPL/lower": 0.9962477998091996, "PPL/zlib": 0.002016769104185992, "Min-5%": 34.83492002300188, "Min-10%": 29.074125112271776, "Min-20%": 22.625330537921933, "Min-30%": 18.60353937366498, "Min-40%": 15.614460064321392, "Min-50%": 13.236759246153099, "Min-60%": 11.24542241985227}, {"text": ". He did not want to look away from her. \n\"What is it?\" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what \nlooked and smelled like dirty laundry. \n\"There,\" she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. \nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, \na ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn \nand horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring \nfrom the place where her neck had been. \nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand \nspinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was \nextinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of \nhim: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- \nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the \ntable where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him \nas he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, \"Harry?\" \n\n\n\f\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass \nsmashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular -- \n\"No!\" he gasped, pinned to the floor. \n\"Yes,\" whispered the voice. \"Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...\" \n\"Accio ... Accio Wand ...\" \nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it \ncoiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into \nhis chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his \nbrain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, \ndistant footsteps, everything going... \nA metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph \nin his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... \nHe was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He \nscrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and \nHermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which \nshattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken \nglass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- his wand -- \nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; \nHermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then \nthere was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking \nHarry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry \nraised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it \nhad done in years. \n\"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!\" \nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves \nfrom the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and \nseized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -- \nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but \nHarry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his \nhead was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- \nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, \nHermione screamed, \"Confringo!\" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the \nwardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt \nthe heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, \nhe leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window \n\n\f\ninto nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... \nAnd then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid \nbedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man \nand the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled \nwith the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in \nChristmas Day... \nAnd his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, \nwhere it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so \nclose to knowing what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his \nbody ...

He had waited for this, he had \nhoped for it ... \n\"Nice costume, mister!\" \nHe saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the \ncloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath \nthe robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would \nnever reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ... \nAnd along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, \nthe Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise \nthan the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, \nand steered over it ... \nThey had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the \ntall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand \nfor the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas.

He found - in my office - he knows I'm a - I'm a -\" Filch's face worked horribly. \"He knows I'm a Squib!\" he finished.\n\u3000\u3000142\n\u3000\u3000\"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don't even know what a Squib is.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were there -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because - because -\" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \"I didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.\n\u3000\u3000Snape's nasty smile widened.\n\u3000\u3000*143*\n\u3000\u3000\"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn't hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light- blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly.\n\u3000\u3000Snape looked furious. So did Filch.\n\u3000\u3000\"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishment!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a very awkward pause.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart's office, they turned into\n\u3000\u3000*144*\n\u3000\u3000an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends' darkened faces.\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\"\n\u3000\u3000Something in Ron's voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But -you must admit it's weird ......\n\u3000\u3000\"I know it's weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing's weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Cbamber Has Been Opened... What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch, he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"He's bitter.\"\n\u3000\u3000A clock chimed somewhere.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mid", "PPL": 0.1311643421649933, "PPL/lower": 0.15831330411678007, "PPL/zlib": 3.979500672481592e-05, "Min-5%": 2.6165030200363084, "Min-10%": 1.3135067745632327, "Min-20%": 0.6562558424193412, "Min-30%": 0.43736185565449986, "Min-40%": 0.3279538551357621, "Min-50%": 0.2623179782056795, "Min-60%": 0.21874647818012907}, {"text": "where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the\n\u3000\u300049\n\u3000\u3000very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.\n\u3000\u3000The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . everyone thinks he's so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\"\n\u3000\u300050\n\u3000\u3000A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin's face.\n\u3000\u3000\"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call ......\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Ministry wouldn't presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Malfoy's lip curled.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome.

Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Though if his grades don't pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all he is fit for -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\n\u3000\u3000\"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today -\"\n\u3000\u3000They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman's rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\n\u3000\u3000* 52\n\u3000\u3000Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle\n\u3000\u3000\"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco -\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven't sold me half of what's hidden in your manor ......\n\u3000\u3000Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.\n\u3000\u3000Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he'd just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he'd be able to find a way out of here.\n\u3000\u3000An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn't help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn't spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes\n\u3000\u3000back in the Weasleys' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\n\u3000\u3000An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I'm just -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"HARRY!

They walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit,\" said Snape.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat.

It was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a long silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he's seeing things like --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\" said Snape softly. \"Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I know that,\" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear. \"It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\" snarled Snape, and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. \"If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,\" said Harry. \"Like you told --\" \"Can anyone confirm that?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" he said, straightening up again. \"Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\n\u3000\u3000Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\" Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. \"He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My dad didn't strut,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"And neither do I.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your father didn't set much store by rules either,\" Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \"Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"SHUT UP!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you say to me, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you to shut up about my dad!\" Harry yelled. I know the truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for my dad!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\n\u3000\u3000\"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?\" he whispered. \"Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.\n\u3000\u3000I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter,\" he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \"Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, Potter!\" he spat suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his ears.\n\u3000\u3000\"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!\"\n\u3000\u3000Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and the Marauder's Map.\n\u3000\u3000Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron gave them to me,\" said Harry, praying he'd get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. \"He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last time --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very touching... and what is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spare bit of parchment,\" he said with a shrug.\n\u3000\u3000Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?\" he said. \"Why don't I just -- throw this away?\"\n\u3000\u3000His hand moved toward the fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" Harry said quickly.\n\u3000\u3000\"So!\" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. \"Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me see, let me see....\" he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk. \"Reveal your secret!\" he said, touching the wand to the parchment.\n\u3000\u3000Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.\n\u3000\u3000\"Show yourself!\" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.\n\u3000\u3000It stayed blank.

For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking \nmore closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of \nAlbus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle \nthe Bard. \n\n\u201cEr \u2013 what are you -- ?\u201d said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a \nlook and turned back to Harry. \n\n\u201cIt keeps cropping up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cI know Viktor said it was \nGrindelwald\u2019s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and the \n\n\f\ndates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, \nwe can\u2019t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means \u2013 I don\u2019t even know whether \nGrindelwald\u2019s still alive \u2013 but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at \nthe wedding. I\u2019m sure this is important, Harry!\u201d \n\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and \nthen out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, \u201cHermione, \nwe don\u2019t need another Godric\u2019s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cBut it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, \nhow do you know we\u2019re not supposed to find out about the sign?\u201d \n\n \u201cHere we go again!\u201d Harry felt slightly exasperated. \u201cWe keep trying to convince \nourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cThe Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\u201d piped up Ron. \u201cI think \nHermione\u2019s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\u201d \n\n Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\u2019s support of Hermione \nhad little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. \n\n \u201cIt won\u2019t be like Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Ron added, \u201cLovegood\u2019s on your side, Harry, \nThe Quibbler\u2019s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they\u2019ve got to help you!\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m sure this is important!\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \n\n \u201cBut don\u2019t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he \ndied?\u201d \n\n \u201cMaybe . . . maybe it\u2019s something you need to find out for yourself,\u201d said \nHermione with a faint air of clutching at straws. \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron sycophantically, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione, \u201cbut I still think we ought to talk to Mr. \nLovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric\u2019s Hollow? Harry, \nI\u2019m sure we ought to know about this!\u201d \n\n \u201cI think we should vote on it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThose in favor of going to see Love \ngood \u2013\u201d \n\n His hand flew into the air before Hermione\u2019s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as \nshe raised her own. \n\n \u201cOutvoted, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Ron, clapping him on the back. \n\n \u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, half amused, half irritated. \u201cOnly, once we\u2019ve seen Lovegood, \nlet\u2019s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood\u2019s live, \nanyway? Do either of you know? \n\n \u201cYeah, they\u2019re not far from my place,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno exactly where, but \nMum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\u2019t be \nhard to find.\u201d \n\n When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. \n\n \u201cYou only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\u201d \n\n \u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d said Ron brightly, \u201cand this is a bit of both. Cheer up, \nit\u2019s the Christmas holidays, Luna\u2019ll be home!\u201d \n\n They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the \nbreezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point \nthe village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight \nstretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking \ntoward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were \n\n\f\nthe high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house \nprotection from Muggle eyes. \n\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\u201d \nsaid Hermione coldly. \n\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t at the Burrow!\u201d said Ron with an incredulous laugh. \u201cDo you think I \nwas going to go back there and tell them all I\u2019d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and \nGeorge would\u2019ve been great about it. And Ginny, she\u2019d have been really understanding.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut where have you been, then?\u201d asked Hermione, surprised. \n\n \u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s new place. Shell cottage. Bill\u2019s always been decent to me. He \u2013 \nhe wasn\u2019t impressed when he heard what I\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t go on about it. He knew \nI was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and \nFleur weren\u2019t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You \nknow, first holiday after they were married. I don\u2019t think Fleur minded. You know how \nmuch she hates Celestina Warbeck.\u201d \n\n Ron turned his back on the Burrow. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s try up here,\u201d he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. \n\n They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\u2019s insistence, hidden beneath the \nInvisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one \nsmall cottage, which seemed deserted. \n\n \u201cDo you think it\u2019s theirs, and they\u2019ve gone away for Christmas?\u201d said Hermione, \npeering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. \nRon snorted. \n\n \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019d be able to tell who lived there if you looked \nthrough the Lovegoods\u2019 window. Let\u2019s try the next lot of hills.\u201d \n\n So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. \n\n \u201cAha!\u201d shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes.

Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn \nright up to them. \n\n \"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. \n\n Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \n\n \"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could \npass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner.\" \n\n \"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \n\n \"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together \nthey lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, \nand let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" \n\n Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having \nan animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally \nwent to Hogwarts. \n\n \"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \n\n \"Ron!\" \n\n Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \n\n \"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying \nattention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The \nsteam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the \nshifting mist. \n\n \"Look who it is.\" \n\n Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up \nto his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The \nnew boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of \nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \n\n \"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in \nevery test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \n\n \"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to \nturn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \n\n \"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get \ntoo friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you \nmarried a pureblood.\" \n\n \"Hey!\" \n\n James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and \nwas evidently bursting with news. \n\n \"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into \nthe billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging \nVictoire!\" \n\n He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \n\n \"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy \nwhat he was doing --\" \n\n \"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron --\" \n\n \"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's \nsnogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \n\n\f\n \"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy \nwould really be part of the family then!\" \n\n \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry \"Why \ndon't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?\" \n\n \"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could \nhave my room!\" \n\n \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the \nhouse demolished.\" \n\n He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \n\n \"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \n\n \"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \n\n \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \n\n \"But you know Neville--\" \n\n James rolled his eyes. \n\n \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into \nHerbology and give him love. . . .\" \n\n Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a \nkick at Albus. \n\n \"See you later, Al.

You said they were invisible!\" \n\n but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a \nfleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint \naway up the corridor to find his friends. \n\n \"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, \nthere's nothing scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the \ncarriages, you'll be going in the boats.\" \n\n Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \n\n \"See you at Christmas.\" \n\n \"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to \ntea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And \ndon't let James wind you up.\" \n\n \"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" \n\n The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of \ndeparture could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. \n\n Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of \nHarry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \n\n \"Ablus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she \nwas tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, \"you were \nnamed for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was \nprobably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \n\n \"But just say--\" \n\n \"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't \nmatter to us, Al. But if it matter to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. \nThe Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \n\n \"Really?\" \n\n \"It did for me,\" said Harry. \n\n\f\n He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in \nAlbus's face when he said it. But how the doorsr were slamming all along the scarlet train, \nand the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute \nreminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. \nStudents were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on \nthe train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \n\n \"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look \nat the other students. \n\n \"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me, I'm extremely famous.\" \n\n Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed.

Saved me.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, I take it you\u2019re not sorry?\u201d said Harry a little impatiently. \n\n \u201cNo, Harry Potter,\u201d said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black \nbeard upon his chin, \u201cbut you are a very odd wizard.\u201d \n\n \u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to \nme.\u201d \n\n The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as \nthough he had never seen anything like him. \n\n \u201cI need to break into a Gringotts vault.\u201d \n\n Harry had not meant to say it so badly: the words were forced from him as pain \nshot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his \nmind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at \nHarry as though he had gone mad. \n\n \u201cHarry \u2013\u201d said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. \n\n \u201cBreak into a Gringotts vault?\u201d repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted \nhis position upon the bed. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \n\n \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ron contradicted him. \u201cIt\u2019s been done.\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven \nyears ago.\u201d \n\n \u201cThe vault in question was empty at the time,\u201d snapped the goblin, and Harry \nunderstood that even though Griphook had let Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of \nits defenses being breached. \u201cIts protection was minimal.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, the vault we need to get into isn\u2019t empty, and I\u2019m guessing its protection \nwill be pretty powerful,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt belongs to the Lestranges.\u201d \n\n He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time \nenough to explain after Griphook had given his answer. \n\n \u201cYou have no chance,\u201d said Griphook flatly. \u201cNo chance at all. If you seek \nbeneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cThief, you have been warned, beware \u2013 yeah, I know, I remember,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to get myself any treasure, I\u2019m not trying to take anything for \npersonal gain. Can you believe that?\u201d \n\n The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead \nprickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. \n\n \u201cIf there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal \ngain,\u201d said Griphook finally, \u201cit would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not \nused to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-\ncarriers.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cWand-carriers,\u201d repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar \nprickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question \nOllivander next door. \n\n \u201cThe right to carry a wand,\u201d said the goblin quietly, \u201chas long been contested \nbetween wizards and goblins.\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins can do magic without wands,\u201d said Ron. \n\n \u201cThat is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other \nmagical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\u201d \n\n \u201cWell, goblins won\u2019t share any of their magic either,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell \nus how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a \nway wizards have never \u2013\u201d \n\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Harry, noting Griphook\u2019s rising color. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about \nwizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature \u2013\u201d \n\n Griphook gave a nasty laugh. \n\n \u201cBut it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, \nyour race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, \nhouse-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\u201d \n\n \u201cWe do!\u201d said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \u201cWe protest! \nAnd I\u2019m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I\u2019m a Mudblood!\u201d \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t call yourself \u2013\u201d Ron muttered. \n\n \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMudblood, and proud of it! I\u2019ve got no \nhigher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to \ntorture, back at the Malfoys!\u201d \n\n As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut \nBellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat. \n\n \u201cDid you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know \nthat we\u2019ve wanted elves to be freed for years?\u201d (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm \nof Hermione\u2019s chair.) \u201cYou can\u2019t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, \nGriphook!\u201d \n\n The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry. \n\n \u201cWhat do you seek within the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cThe sword \nthat lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\u201d He looked from one to the other of them. \n\u201cI think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut the fake sword isn\u2019t the only thing in that vault, is it?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cPerhaps \nyou\u2019ve seen other things in there?\u201d \n\n His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the \npulsing of his scar. \n\n The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. \n\n \u201cIt is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians \nof fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so \noften, wrought by our fingers.\u201d \n\n The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione \nto Ron and then back again. \n\n \u201cSo young,\u201d he said finally, \u201cto be fighting so many.\u201d \n\n \u201cWill you help us?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a hope of breaking in without a \ngoblin\u2019s help. You\u2019re our one chance.\u201d \n\n\f\n \u201cI shall . . . think about it,\u201d said Griphook maddeningly. \n\n \u201cBut \u2013\u201d Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \n\n The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his \nshort legs. \n\n \u201cI think,\u201d he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur\u2019s bed, \u201cthat \nthe Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and \ntook the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin.

No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\u201d \n\n \u201cThere are legends, though,\u201d said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain \nin his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea \ninto action. \u201cLegends about a wand \u2013 or wands \u2013 that have been passed from hand to \nhand by murder.\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned pale.

You said he just \nhad to borrow another wizard\u2019s wand?\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He \nnodded slowly. \n\n \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cMine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you \nknow why that is?\u201d \n\n Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. \n\n\f\n \u201cI had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique \nthat night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would \nhave snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . . \n\n\u201cWe were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. \nWhen You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and \nasked about that other wand, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d \n\n Harry did not answer. \n\n \u201cYes, he asked,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cHe wanted to know everything I could \ntell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the \nElder Wand.\u201d \n\n Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flaggergasted. \n\n \u201cThe Dark Lord,\u201d said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \u201chad always \nbeen happy with the wand I made him \u2013 yes and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half \ninches. \u2013 until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, \nmore powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\u201d \n\n \u201cBut he\u2019ll know soon, if he doesn\u2019t already, that mine\u2019s broken beyond repair,\u201d \nsaid Harry quietly. \n\n \u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, sounding frightened. \u201cHe can\u2019t know that, Harry, how \ncould he --?\u201d \n\n\u201cPriori Incantatem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe left your wand and the blackthorn wand at \nthe Malfoys\u2019, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells \nthey\u2019ve cast lately, they\u2019d see that yours broke mine, they\u2019ll see that you tried and failed \nto mend it, and they\u2019ll realize that I\u2019ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.\u201d \n\nThe little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron \ngave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that now ---\u201d \n\nBut Mr. Ollivander intervened. \n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. \nPotter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly \ninvulnerable.\u201d \n\n \u201cAnd will it?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\u201d said Ollivander, \u201cbut the \nidea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.\u201d \n\n Harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure, when they first met, of how much \nhe like Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the \nidea of the Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it \nrepulsed him. \n\n \u201cYou \u2013 you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?\u201d asked Hermione. \n\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cYes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand\u2019s course \nthrough history. There are gaps, of, course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, \ntemporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying \ncharacteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written \naccounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business \nto study. They have the ring of authenticity.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo you \u2013 you don\u2019t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?\u201d Hermione asked \nhopefully. \n\n\f\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cWhether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its \nhistory is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, \nand arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong \nhands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\u201d \n\n \u201cMr. Ollivander,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe Elder Wand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\n Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. \n\n \u201cBut how \u2013 how do you -- ?\u201d \n\n \u201cNever mind how I know it,\u201d said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar \nburned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, \nbecause it was so much farther north. \u201cYou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had \nthe wand?\u201d \n\n \u201cIt was a rumor,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cA rumor, years and years ago, long \nbefore you were born I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it \nwould be for business; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder \nWand!\u201d \n\n \u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d said Harry. He stood up. \u201cMr. Ollivander, one last thing, and \nthen we\u2019ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\u201d \n\n \u201cThe \u2013 the what?\u201d asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered. \n\n \u201cThe Deathly Hallows.\u201d \n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Is this still something to do \nwith wands?\u201d \n\n Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He \ndid not know about the Hallows. \n\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll leave you to get some \nrest now.\u201d \n\n Ollivander looked stricken. \n\n \u201cHe was torturing me!\u201d he gasped. \u201cThe Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no \nidea. . . .\u201d \n\n \u201cI do,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all \nof this.\u201d \n\n He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, \nFleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them.

The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then,\" he said, glancing around them. \"Let's do this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.\n\u3000\u3000In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.\n\u3000\u3000Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, there's Penelope!\" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn't miss his shiny badge. stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to talk to you in private,\" Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Go away, Ginny,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, that's nice,\" said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train.\n\u3000\u3000This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.\n\u3000\u3000The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that had been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who d'you reckon he is?\" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor R. J.

The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wonder what he teaches?\" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid profile.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's obvious,\" whispered Hermione. \"There's only one vacancy, isn't there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed.\n\u3000\u3000\"well, I hope he's up to it,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"He looks like on, good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway...\" He turned to Harry. \"What were you going to tell us?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \\When he'd finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \"Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for trouble, Harry --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I Don't go looking for trouble,\" said Harry, nettled. \"Trouble usually finds me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\n\u3000\u3000They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.\n\u3000\u3000\"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\" said Ron uncomfortably. \"No one's ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they'll catch him, won't they?\" said Hermione earnestly. \"I Mean, they've got all the Muggles looking out for him too....\" \"What's that noise?\" said Ron suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked all around the compartment.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's coming from your trunk, Harry,\" said Ron, standing UP and reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that a Sneakoscope?\" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one,\" Ron said. \"It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\" said Hermione shrewdly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol.

Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.\n\u3000\u3000\"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron, sitting back down. \"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff.

Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively.\n\u3000\u3000\"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket.

Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get off, Ron!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\"\n\u3000\u3000They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where's Hermione gone?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe -- maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.\n\u3000\u3000\"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.\n\u3000\u3000They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wh -- what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see you in Divination!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\"\n\u3000\u3000Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione snorted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.\n\u3000\u3000It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not.\n\u3000\u3000\"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the super", "PPL": 5.441965579986572, "PPL/lower": 0.9552143652572898, "PPL/zlib": 0.0016796190061686951, "Min-5%": 31.36491362253825, "Min-10%": 26.0140144591238, "Min-20%": 20.21798002107802, "Min-30%": 16.21078980706802, "Min-40%": 13.25186390754504, "Min-50%": 10.859057690395275, "Min-60%": 9.075078655818496}, {"text": "Ron, \"It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look \nafter itself.

You-Know-Who will know \nwe know about his Horcruxes!\" \n\"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!\" said Ron hopefully, \"Maybe \nthey'll cover up --\" \nThe sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were \nextinguished. Pain cleaved Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing \nin a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor \nat his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. \n\"What did you say to me?\" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear \nburned inside him. The one thing that he had dreaded - but it could not be \ntrue, he could not see how... \nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. \n\"Say it again!\" murmured Voldemort. \"Say it again!\" \n\"M-my Lord,\" stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, \n\"m-my Lord... we t-tried to st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - \nbroke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...\" \n\"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing \nimpostors? Who were they? \n\"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...\" \n\"And they took?\" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping \nhim, \"Tell me! What did they take?\" \n\"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...\" \nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He \nwas crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had \nknown. How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? \nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through \nthe room; the kneeling goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards \nscattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others \nbehind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, \nand those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, \nfor hearing about the golden cup - \nAlone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him \nin vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the \ndiary was destroyed and the cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew \nabout the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of \nthem? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always \nsuspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was \nhis now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the \nboy - \nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord \nVoldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of \nthem all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how \n\n\f\nmany other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not have known, \nif he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? \nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had \nthought that was because he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... \nNo, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes must be intact... \nBut he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside \nthe goblin's corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his \nboiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts - \nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he \nhad hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be \nrelated to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never \nbeen traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. \nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate \nits protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... \nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the \nHorcrux, because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place... \nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to \ndo his bidding, under his protection... \nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding \nplaces, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, \nlike the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone... \nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease \nflickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore \nmight have made the connection with the Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, \nperhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would \ngo first... \nThe lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility \nthat Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the \norphanage. \nAnd Hogwarts... but he knew the his Horcrux there was safe; it would be \nimpossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the \nschool. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that \nthe boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy might \nreturn would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust \nBellatrix and Malfoy. Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how \nunwise it was ever to trust? \nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He \nwould not be parted from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, \nthrough the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he \ncalled the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a \nlong shadow. ... \nHarry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He \nwas lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione \nwere looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the \ncontinued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort's mind \nhad not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that \n\n\f\nhe was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass \nbefore him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. \n\"He knows.\" His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high \nscreams. \"He knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the \nlast one,\" he was already on his feet,\" is at Hogwarts.

Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\n\u3000\u3000The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\n\u3000\u3000Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in London?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Righto,\" said Stan. \"'Old tight, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000BANG.\n\u3000\u3000They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he didn't know.\n\u3000\u3000Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\n\u3000\u3000He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well,\" said Harry. \"'Bye then!\"\n\u3000\u3000But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. \"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice.\n\u3000\u3000Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.\n\u3000\u3000Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\n\u3000\u3000\"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville?\" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I knew it!\" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is, Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Stan's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\n\u3000\u3000`Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\n\u3000\u3000Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn't to know that.\n\u3000\u3000Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and that's what matters.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry unstuck his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\"\n\u3000\u3000It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now.\n\u3000\u3000\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and\n\u3000\u3000\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh, my dear boy,", "PPL": 5.088862895965576, "PPL/lower": 0.9601940484467919, "PPL/zlib": 0.0015818659919072354, "Min-5%": 30.83627093072031, "Min-10%": 25.515076833612778, "Min-20%": 19.390305276604913, "Min-30%": 15.372945194523963, "Min-40%": 12.434714596204559, "Min-50%": 10.158136248675874, "Min-60%": 8.486456008930615}, {"text": "particular, \n\"Leprechaun,\" and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was \nexamined and given back to him. \n\n Hermione stepped forward. \n\n \"Madam Lestrange!\" said the goblin, evidently startled. \"Dear me!\" How--how \nmay I help you today?\" \n\n \"I wish to enter my vault,\" said Hermione. \n\n The old goblin seemed to recoil a little.

I--I have never been asked for identification before!\" said \nHermione. \n\n \"They know!\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"They must have been warned \nthere might be an imposter!\" \n\n \"Your wand will do, madam,\" said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling \nhand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were \naware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. \n\n \"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperious Curse!\" \n\n Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, \nand whispered, for the first time in his life, \"Imperio!\" \n\n A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that \nseemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand \nand the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and \nthen said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \n\n \"What?\" said Hermione, \"No, no, that's mine--\" \n\n \"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all \naround were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" \n\n Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \n\"Imperio!\" once more. \n\n \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very \nhandsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't \nyou?\" \n\n Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted \nthe bizarre turn of events without comment. \n\n The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin \napproached. \n\n \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a \nmoment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed \nto his senior. \"Good, good! S, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\" said the old \ngoblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight. \"I shall take you to your \nvault.\" \n\n He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the \ncontents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his \nmouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by \nregarding Travers with confusion. \n\n\f\n \u201cWait \u2013 Bogrod!\u201d \n\n Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. \n\n \u201cWe have instructions,\u201d he said with a bow to Hermione. \u201cForgive me, Madam, \nbut there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\u201d \n\n He whispered urgently in Bogrod\u2019s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. \n\n \u201cI am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault \u2026 \nVery old family \u2026 old clients \u2026 This way, please \u2026 \u201c \n\n And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. \nHarry looked back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, \nand made his decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, \nwalking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone \npassageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble; they suspect,\u201d said Harry as the door slammed behind them \nand he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: \nneither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of \nHarry Potter in their midst. \u201cThey\u2019re Imperiused,\u201d he added, in response to Hermione and \nRon\u2019s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there \nlooking blank. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did it strongly enough, I don\u2019t know \u2026\u201d \n\n And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange \nshrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: \u201cYou need to mean \nthem, Potter!\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cShall we get out now, while we can?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf we can,\u201d said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, \nbeyond which who knew what was happening. \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got this far, I say we go on,\u201d said Harry. \n\n \u201cGood!\u201d said Griphook. \u201cSo, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have \nthe authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\u201d \n\n Harry pointed his wand at Travers. \n\n \u201cImperio!\u201d \n\n The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace. \n\n \u201cWhat are you making him do?\u201d \n\n \u201cHide,\u201d said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a \nlittle cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was \nsure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, \nBogrod in front of Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. \n\n With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurried past Travers, who \nwas wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through \nthe labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything \nover the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved \nbetween stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They \nmight as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, \nthe more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought \nalong Bellatrix\u2019s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it \u2013 \n\n There were a deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a \nhairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding \nover the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \u201cNo!\u201d but there was no braking. They \n\n\f\nzoomed through it. Water filled Harry\u2019s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: \nThen, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry \nheard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek \nsomething, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing \npainlessly on the rocky passage floor. \n\n \u201cC-Cushioning Charm,\u201d Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to \nHarry\u2019s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in \noverlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless \nagain. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces. \n\n \u201cThe Thief\u2019s Downfall!\u201d said Gri", "PPL": 6.542511463165283, "PPL/lower": 0.9882092410821164, "PPL/zlib": 0.002052874635445649, "Min-5%": 34.871587472803455, "Min-10%": 29.012778964697144, "Min-20%": 22.24707288905286, "Min-30%": 18.114334018688638, "Min-40%": 15.14084562987162, "Min-50%": 12.799940546470188, "Min-60%": 10.880095576400283}, {"text": "shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --\"\n\u3000\u3000Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed.

The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. \"One moment, please, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore's voice. \"You need to sign too.\" The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, hurry!\" she mouthed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees....\n\u3000\u3000\"Quick! Quick!\" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.\n\u3000\u3000\"Stop!\" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\n\u3000\u3000Silence... then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is it?\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is the beast?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was tied here!\" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just here!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Beaky!\" said Hagrid huskily.\n\u3000\u3000There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\"\n\u3000\u3000Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone untied him!\" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search the grounds, the forest.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?\" said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \"Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"O' -- o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \"Come in, come in....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now what?\" whispered Harry, looking around.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for another couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult....\"\n\u3000\u3000She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're going to have to move,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"We've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. \"But we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember....\"\n\u3000\u3000They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Ron!\" said Harry suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\n\u3000\u3000And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\n\u3000\u3000\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"There's Sirius!\" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron....\n\u3000\u3000\"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?\" said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--\"\n\u3000\u3000The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"And there we go...\" Harry muttered. \"We're in.\"\n\u3000\u3000The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!\" said Hermione. \"If only Dumbledore had come with us...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair and Fudge would've come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot....\"\n\u3000\u3000They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --\n\u3000\u3000\"Here comes Lupin!\" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.\n\u3000\u3000They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.\n\u3000\u3000\"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lying there....\"\n\u3000\u3000He turned to Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, we mustn't be seen!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How can you stand this?\" he asked Hermione fiercely. \"Just standing here and watching it happen?\" He hesitated. \"I'm going to grab the cloak!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, no!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"See?\" Hermione whispered. \"See what would", "PPL": 5.628253936767578, "PPL/lower": 0.9427771456194141, "PPL/zlib": 0.0018686102047701123, "Min-5%": 31.496207368140126, "Min-10%": 26.596257808161717, "Min-20%": 20.49173379119276, "Min-30%": 16.51296428826422, "Min-40%": 13.563604703450844, "Min-50%": 11.206111073319164, "Min-60%": 9.379773428909335}, {"text": "and the only people who could have \ntold him were directly involved in the plan.

The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \"Voldemort \n\n\f\nonly caught up with me toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. \nIf he'd been in on the plan he'd have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\" \n\n \"Voldemort caught up with you?\" said Lupin sharply. \"What happened? How did \nyou escape?\" \n\n Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize \nhim as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have \nsummoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the \nsanctuary of Tonks's parents. \n\n \"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?\" \n\n \"I . . .\" Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic \nand confusion. \"I saw Stan Shunpike . . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor \non the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of \u2013 well, he doesn't know what \nhe's doing, does he?

At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!\" \n\n \"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd \nfallen, he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me \nfrom Voldemort two years ago,\" Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the \nsneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach \nDumbledore's Army how to Disarm. \n\n \"Yes, Harry,\" said Lupin with painful restraint, \"and a great number of Death \nEaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under \nthe imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either \nwitnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\" \n\n \"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\" said Harry angrily. \n\n \"Of course not,\" said Lupin, \"but the Death Eaters \u2013 frankly, most people! \u2013 \nwould have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the \nDeath Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become \nso!\" \n\n Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance \ninside him. \n\n \"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there,\" said Harry, \"That's \nVoldemort's job.\" \n\n Lupin's retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid \nstaggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths \nand apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. \n\n \"Will George be okay?\" \n\n All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. \n\n \"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been \ncursed off \u2013\" \n\n There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt \nover Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. \n\n Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized \nthey were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both \nclutching a bent coat hanger, Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley \n\n\f\nshowed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him \nraise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. \n\n \"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!\" \n\n \"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'\" said Lupin calmly. \n\n Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \"It's him, I've checked!\" \n\n \"All right, all right!\" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, \n\"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\" \n\n \"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently they did not realize that there would \nbe seven Harrys.\" \n\n \"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley. \"Who else is back?\" \n\n \"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.\" \n\n Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. \n\n \"What happened to you?\" Lupin asked Kingsley. \n\n \"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one,\" Kingsley reeled off, \"and we \nsaw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty \nquickly. Remus, he can \u2013\" \n\n \"Fly,\" supplied Harry. \"I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\" \n\n \"So that's why he left, to follow you!\" said Kingsley, \"I couldn't understand why \nhe'd vanished. But what made him change targets?\" \n\n \"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Stan?\" repeated Hermione. \"But I thought he was in Azkaban?\" \n\n Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. \n\n \"Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has \nhushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. But \nwhat happened to you, Remus? Where's George?\" \n\n \"He lost an ear,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"lost an -- ?\" repeated Hermione in a high voice. \n\n \"Snape's work,\" said Lupin. \n\n \"Snape?\" shouted Harry. \"You didn't say \u2013\" \n\n \"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of \nSnape's. I wish I could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep \nGeorge on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.\" \n\n Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no \nsign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying \nfriends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, \nTonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus? \n\n \"Harry, give us a hand!\" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was \nstuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the \nempty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still \ntending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight \nHarry saw a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. \n\n \"How is he?\" \n\n Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, \"I can't make it grow back, not when it's \nbeen removed by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse . . . .

Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black. The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a brother.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\n\u3000\u3000\"DON'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \"You -- you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- you and him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, calm down --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I've been covering up for you --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, listen to me, please'\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain --\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave of fury.\n\u3000\u3000\"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of control, \"and all the time you've been his friend!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am now -- Let me explain....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don't trust him, he's been helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he's a werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his face. \"But I won't deny that I am a werewolf.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get away ftom me, werewolf!\"\n\u3000\u3000Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione and said, \"How long have you known?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ages,\" Hermione whispered. \"Since I did Professor Snape's essay...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be delighted,\" said Lupin coolly. \"He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Lupin forced a laugh.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have told everyone what you are!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But they already know,\" said Lupin. \"At least, the staff do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Some of the staff thought so,\" said Lupin. \"He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"AND HE WAS WRONG!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\" He was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of them, dragging his leg.\n\u3000\u3000I have not been helping Sirius,\" said Lupin. \"If you'll give me a chance, I'll explain. Look --\"\n\u3000\u3000He separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned.\n\u3000\u3000There, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt \"You're armed, we're not. Now will you listen?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?\n\u3000\u3000\"If you haven't been helping him,\" he said, with a furious glance at Black, \"how did you know he was here?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The map,\" said Lupin. \"The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining it --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You know how to work it?\" Harry said suspiciously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know how to work it,\" said Lupin, waving his hand impatiently. \"I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends' nickname for me at school.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You wrote --?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn't I\"\n\u3000\u3000He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--\"\n\u3000\u3000\"How d'you know about the cloak?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,\" said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. \"The point is, even if you're wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off", "PPL": 5.634416580200195, "PPL/lower": 0.9446013509073546, "PPL/zlib": 0.0018222563325356387, "Min-5%": 32.960720660639744, "Min-10%": 27.113105970270492, "Min-20%": 20.872914559100835, "Min-30%": 16.792764770868157, "Min-40%": 13.745039854772516, "Min-50%": 11.252058062298207, "Min-60%": 9.391653918739292}, {"text": "be alive.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're\n\u3000\u3000*280*\n\u3000\u3000made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, Id like to know?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \"He was innocent.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent.\n\u3000\u3000As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.\n\u3000\u3000Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\u3000\u3000Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\n\u3000\u3000He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\n\u3000\u3000*281*\n\u3000\u3000everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.\n\u3000\u3000He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron -\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron -that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snufing snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think - not Moaning Myrtle?\"\n\u3000\u3000A ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just\n\u3000\u3000three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day,\n\u3000\u3000\"and we could've asked her, and now. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls' bathroom, the girls' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.\n\u3000\u3000But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\n\u3000\u3000`Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We're still getting exams?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom's wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professorr\n\u3000\u3000*28%*\n\u3000\u3000McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.\n\u3000\u3000\"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\"\n\u3000\u3000Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore's instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn't seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked as though he'd just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\n\u3000\u3000Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table.\n\u3000\u3000284*\n\u3000\u3000\"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly.\n\u3000\u3000When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn't at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn't joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he'd looked in days.\n\u3000\u3000\"It won't matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry. \"Hermione'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she'll go crazy when she finds out we've got exams in three days' time. She hasn't studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they're over.\"\n\u3000\u3000Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn't think who.\n\u3000\u3000\"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her.\n\u3000\u3000Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What is it?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan.\n\u3000\u3000\"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny.

Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.\n\u3000\u3000\"What are they for, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus....\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking.\n\u3000\u3000I got somethin' ter discuss with you two,\" said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione,\" said Hagrid.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about her?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"-- ate Scabbers!\" Ron interjected angrily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case, mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand a good chance now...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --\" Harry began awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm not blamin' yeh!\" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. \"Gawd knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats.

She's got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to her --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!\" Ron said angrily. \"But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she won't hear a word against it!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,\" said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's pillow.\n\u3000\u3000They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle.\n\u3000\u3000A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hogsmeade, next weekend!\" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. \"What d'you reckon?\" he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes....\" Harry said, even more quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry!\" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?\" growled Ron, not looking at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!\" said Ron furiously. \"Haven't you done enough damage this year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls' dormitories.\n\u3000\u3000\"So how about it?\" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\"\n\u3000\u3000On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Bye!\" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back!\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron grinned and winked.\n\u3000\u3000Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.\n\u3000\u3000Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Dissendium!\" and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Neville,\" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket. \"What are you up to?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Nothing,\" shrugged Neville. \"Want a game of Exploding Snap?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with you!\" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Great, you can help me!\" said Neville, his round face anxious. \"I don't understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it, or --\"\n\u3000\u3000He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what are you two doing here?\" said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. \"An odd place to meet --\"\n\u3000\u3000To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.\n\u3000\u3000\"We're not -- meeting here,\" said Harry. \"We just -- met here.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Indeed?\" said Snape. \"You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Neville set off without another word.

I b-bought it \nwhen I was eleven years old. It \u2013 it \u2013 it \u2013 chose me.\u201d \n\n She cried harder than ever. \n\n Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She \nleaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold \nswung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket. \n\n Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still \nintent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else. \n\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Umbridge, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose \nwitches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that \nwas sent to you here \u2013 Mafalda, pass them to me.\u201d \n\n Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that \nHarry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione\u2019s hands \nwere shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair \nbeside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s name on it. \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s pretty, Dolores,\u201d she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the \nruffled folds of Umbridge\u2019s blouse. \n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Umbridge, glancing down. \u201cOh yes \u2013 an old family heirloom,\u201d \nshe said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. \u201cThe S stands for Selwyn\u2026. I am \nrelated to the Selwyns\u2026. Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not \nrelated. \u2026A pity,\u201d she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s \nquestionnaire, \u201cthat the same cannot be said for you. \u2018Parents professions: \ngreengrocers\u2019.\u201d \n\n Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and \nthe dementors stood waiting in the corners. \n\n It was Umbridge\u2019s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry\u2019s brain and \nobliterated his sense of caution \u2013 that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty \ncriminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, \nnot even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge \nof the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down \nbelow, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: \nYaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry\u2019s \ndisembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: \n\u201cStupefy!\u201d \n\n Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. \n\n \u201cHarry!\u201d \n\n \u201cHermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHarry, Mrs. Cattermole!\u201d \n\n Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the \ndementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained \nto the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their \nmasters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. \nCattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and \nforced her face back. \n\n\f\n \u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d \n\n The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry\u2019s wand and leaped toward the \ndementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag\u2019s light, \nmore powerful and more warming than the cat\u2019s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it \ncantered around the room. \n\n \u201cGet the Horcrux,\u201d Harry told Hermione. \n\n He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and \napproached Mrs. Cattermole. \n\n \u201cYou?\u201d she whispered, gazing into his face. \u201cBut \u2013 but Reg said you were the one \nwho submitted my name for questioning!\u201d \n\n \u201cDid I?\u201d muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had \na change of heart. Diffindo!\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cHermione, how do I get rid of these \nchains?\u201d \n\u201cWait, I\u2019m trying something up here \u2013\u201c \n\n \u201cHermione, we\u2019re surrounded by dementors!\u201d \n\n \u201cI know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket\u2019s gone \u2013 I need to \nduplicate it \u2013 Geminio! There\u2026 That should fool her\u2026.\u201d \n\n Hermione came running downstairs. \n\n \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026. Relashio!\u201d \n\n The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole \nlooked just as frightened as ever before. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave here with us,\u201d said Harry, pulling her to her feet. \u201cGo \nhome, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you\u2019ve got to. Disguise \nyourselves and run. You\u2019ve seen how it is, you won\u2019t get anything like a fair hearing \nhere.\u201d \n\n \u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow are we going to get out of here with all those \ndementors outside the door?\u201d \n\n \u201cPatronuses,\u201d said Harry, pointing his wand at his own.

Someone grab \nhim!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in \nfront of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the \nHufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their \nbacks to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and \noverwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from \nunder sleeves. \n\n \n\n \"Thank you, Miss Parkinson.\" said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \n\"You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.\" \n\n \n\n Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins \ntrooping out on the other side of the Hall. \n\n \n\n \"Ravenclaws, follow on!\" cried Professor McGonagall. \n\n \n\n Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but \na number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more \nHufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating \nProfessor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on \ntheir way. \n\n \n\n \"Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\" \n\n \n\n Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table. \n\n \n\n \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" \n\n \n\n \"Haven't you found -?\" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. \n\n \n\n But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to \naddress those who had remained behind. \n\n \n\n \"We've only got half an half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A \nbattle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the \nPhoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of \nfighters up to the three highest towers - Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor - where \nthey'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile \nRemus\" - he indicated Lupin - \"Arthur\" - he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the \nGryffindor table - \"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to \norganize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -\" \n\n \n\n \"Sounds like a job for us.\" called Fred, indicating himself and George, and \nKingsley nodded his approval. \n\n \n\n \"All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!\" \n\n \n\n\f\n \"Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the \nplatform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \"Aren't you supposed to be looking \nfor something?\" \n\n \n\n \"What? Oh,\" said Harry, \"oh yeah!\" \n\n \n\n He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was \nbeing fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and \nHermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind. \n\n \n\n \"Then go, Potter, go!\" \n\n \n\n \"Right - yeah -\" \n\n \n\n He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the \nentrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up \nthe marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. \nFear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to \nconcentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly \nas wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not \nseem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along a passage, \nwhere he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out \nof the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on \nit, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of \nRequirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his \nhands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. \n\n \n\n Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. \n\n \n\n There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto \nCarrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation; \nVoldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. \n\n \n\n But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost \ndiadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that \nVoldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of \nRavenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem \nin living memory? \n\n \n\n In living memory... \n\n \n\n Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth \nand tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of \nhundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder \nas he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep \ntrack of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry \n\n\f\nsaw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and \nthere younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or \nsiblings. \n\n \n\n Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below \nand yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor. \n\n \n\n \"Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\" \n\n \n\n He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom \nof the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for \nhim. \n\n \n\n \"Harry! My dear boy!\" \n\n \n\n Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they \nhad been thrust into icy water. \n\n \n\n \"Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\" \n\n \n\n Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended. \n\n \n\n \"The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?\" \n\n \n\n \"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?\" \n\n \n\n \"Let's see...\" \n\n \n\n Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering \nover the heads of the swarming students. \n\n \n\n \"That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\" \n\n \n\n Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall \nghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away \nthrough a solid wall. \n\n \n\n Harry ran after her.

Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\"\n\u3000\u3000His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's happening again now.

I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\n\u3000\u3000 *241*\n\u3000\u3000growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let me show you. \"\n\u3000\u3000Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n\u3000\u3000(40K.55\n\u3000\u3000The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\n\u3000\u3000He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\n\u3000\u3000He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\"\n\u3000\u3000But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\"\n\u3000\u3000Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\n\u3000\u3000*242*\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted.\n\u3000\u3000The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\n\u3000\u3000The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\n\u3000\u3000There was a knock on the office door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\n\u3000\u3000A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\"\n\u3000\u3000* 243*\n\u3000\u3000\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are Muggle-born?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And are both your parents -?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n\u3000\u3000\"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n\u3000\u3000\"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Riddle's eyes had widened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly.\n\u3000\u3000But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000*244*\n\u3000\u3000Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\n\u3000\u3000\"You may go, Tom ......\n\u3000\u3000Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.\n\u3000\u3000Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\n\u3000\u3000Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him.

He picked up a fistful of leaves and began \ntearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be that long \nand I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d \n\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t your dad like magic?\u201d \n\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anything, much,\u201d said Snape. \n\n \u201cSeverus?\u201d \n\n A little smile twisted Snape\u2019s mouth when she said his name. \n\n \u201cYeah?\u201d \n\n \u201cTell me about the dementors again.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat d\u2019you want to know about them for?\u201d \n\n \u201cIf I use magic outside school \u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who \ndo really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You\u2019re not going to end up \nin Azkaban, you\u2019re too \u2013 \u201d \n\n He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind \nHarry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to \nhis feet. \n\n \u201cWho\u2019s spying now?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d \n\n Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling \nfor something hurtful to say. \n\n \u201cWhat is that you\u2019re wearing, anyway?\u201d she said, pointing at Snape\u2019s chest. \n\u201cYour mum\u2019s blouse?\u201d \n\n There was a crack. A branch over Petunia\u2019s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The \nbranch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears. \n\n \u201cTuney!\u201d \n\n But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. \n\n \u201cDid you make that happen?\u201d \n\n \u201cNo.\u201d He looked both defiant and scared. \n\n \u201cYou did!\u201d She was backing away from him. \u201cYou did! You hurt her!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 no, I didn\u2019t!\u201d \n\n But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the \nlittle thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused\u2026 \n\n\f\n And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and \nthree quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, \nsour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a \nshort distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to \nbe pleading with her sister. Harry moved closer to listen. \n\n \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Tuney, I\u2019m sorry! Listen \u2013 \u201d She caught her sister\u2019s hand and held \ntight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \u201cMaybe once I\u2019m there \u2013 no, listen, \nTuney! Maybe once I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade \nhim to change his mind!\u201d \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t \u2013 want \u2013 to \u2013 go!\u201d said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her \nsister\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a \u2013 a\u2026\u201d \n\n Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners\u2019 \narms, over the owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some \nalready in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else \ngreeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart. \n\n \u201c \u2013 you think I want to be a \u2013 a freak?\u201d \n\n Lily\u2019s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away. \n\n \u201cI\u2019m not a freak,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u201d \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going,\u201d said Petunia with relish. \u201cA special school for \nfreaks. You and that Snape boy\u2026weirdos, that\u2019s what you two are. It\u2019s good you\u2019re \nbeing separated from normal people. It\u2019s for our safety.\u201d \n\n Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an \nair of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, \nand her voice was low and fierce. \n\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was such a freak\u2019s school when you wrote to the headmaster \nand begged him to take you.\u201d \n\n Petunia turned scarlet. \n\n \u201cBeg? I didn\u2019t beg!\u201d \n\n \u201cI saw his reply. It was very kind.\u201d \n\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have read \u2013 \u201d whispered Petunia, \u201cthat was my private \u2013 how \ncould you \u2013 ?\u201d \n\n Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. \nPetunia gasped. \n\n \u201cThat boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\u201d \n\n \u201cNo \u2013 not sneaking \u2013 \u201d Now Lily was on the defensive. \u201cSeverus saw the \nenvelope, and he couldn\u2019t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that\u2019s all! \nHe says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of \n\u2013 \u201d \n\n \u201cApparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\u201d said Petunia, now as pale \nas she had been flushed. \u201cFreak!\u201d she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her \nparents stood\u2026 \n\n The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the \nHogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his \nschool robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle \nclothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were \n\n\f\ntalking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against \nthe windowpane. \n\n Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at \nhim and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying. \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she said in a constricted voice. \n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\n \u201cTuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\u201d \n\n \u201cSo what?\u201d \n\n She threw him a look of deep dislike. \n\n \u201cSo she\u2019s my sister!\u201d \n\n \u201cShe\u2019s only a \u2013 \u201d He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her \neyes without being noticed, did not hear him. \n\n \u201cBut we\u2019re going!\u201d he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \u201cThis \nis it! We\u2019re off to Hogwarts!\u201d \n\n She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. \n\n \u201cYou\u2019d better be in Slytherin,\u201d said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a \nlittle. \n", "PPL": 7.220315456390381, "PPL/lower": 0.947699556044903, "PPL/zlib": 0.002365765221622012, "Min-5%": 37.83899054807775, "Min-10%": 31.185784087461585, "Min-20%": 24.080454532558004, "Min-30%": 19.556975752988933, "Min-40%": 16.43289243329708, "Min-50%": 14.004541394064969, "Min-60%": 11.984381292075987}, {"text": "\n\"Patronuses, Harry, come on!\" \nhe raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading \nthroughout him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know \nabout? He felt as though his soul had already half left his body.... \n\"HARRY, COME ON!\" screamed Hermione. \nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking \ntheir way closer to Harry's despair, which was like a promise of a \nfeast... \nHe saw Ron's silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and \nexpire; he saw Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his \nown wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming \noblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... \nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and \nHermione's heads: the dementors fell back before the creatures' \napproach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to \nstand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast \nPatronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus. \n\"That's right,\" said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in \nthe Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the \nD.A., \"That's right, Harry...come on think of something happy...\" \n'something happy?\" he said, his voice cracked. \n\"We're all still here,\" she whispered, \"we;re still fighting. Come \non, now....\" \nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the \ngreatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of \nHarry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered \nin earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the \nsounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears. \n\"Can't thank you enough,\" said ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, \nand Seamus \"you just saved--\" \nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came \nlurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, \nbrandishing a club taller than any of them. \n\"RUN!\" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They \nall scattered, and not a second too soon, for the next moment the \n\n\f\ncreature's vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been \nstanding. Harry looked round: ron and Hermione were following him, \nbut the other three had vanished back into the battle. \n\"Let's get out of range!\" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club \nagain and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds \nwehere bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the \ndarkness. \n\"The Whomping willow,\" said Harry, \"go!\" \nSomehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small \nspace into which he could not look now: thoughts of Fred and \nHagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in \nand outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had \nto reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione \nsaid, the only way to end it-- \nHe sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, \nignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, \nand the sound of hte lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking \nof the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through \ngrounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran \nfaster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw \nthe great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its \nroots with whiplike, slashing branches. \nPanting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's \nswiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its tick \ntrunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree \nthat would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out \nof breath that she could not speak. \n\"How--how're we going to get in?\" panted ron. \"I can--see the palce- \n-if we jsut had--Crookshanks again--\" \n\"Crookshanks?\" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \n\"Are you a wizard, or what?\" \n\"Oh--right--yeah--\" \nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground \nand said \"Winguardium Leviosa!\" The twig flew up from the gruond, \nspun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed \ndirectly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying \nbranches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the \nwrithing tree became still. \n\"Perfect!\" panted Hermione. \n\"Wait.\" \nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle \nfilled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, \nwanted him to come...Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap? \nBut the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: the only \nway forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where \nVoldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... \n\n\f\n\"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!\" said Ron, pushing him \nforward. \nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. \nIt was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they \nhad entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: they had had to \ndouble up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now \nthere was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand \nilluminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none \ncame. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging \nbeam of the wand held in his fist. At last, the tunnel began to \nslope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged \nat his ankle. \n\"The Cloak!\" she whispered. \"Put the Cloak on!\" \nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth \ninto his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, \nmurmered, \"Nox,\" extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his \nhands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, \nexpecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear \nvoice, see a flash of green light. \nand then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of \nthem, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the \nendo fht etuunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old \ncrate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up tot he \nopening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall. \nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign \nand coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, \nstarry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see \nthe edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a \nwand. \nThen Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away \nfrom where he crouched, hidden. \n\"...my Lord, their resistance is crumbling--\" \n\"--and it is doing so without your help,\" said Voldemort in his \nhigh, clear voice. \"Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do \nnot think you will make much difference now. We are almost \nthere...almost.\" \n\"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find \nhim, my Lord.
