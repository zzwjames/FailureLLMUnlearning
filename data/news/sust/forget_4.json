["A MRH-90 Taipan helicopter, similar to the one seen here in 2021, went down during a night-time military exercise\n\nDebris has been found after an Australian military helicopter crashed off the coast of Queensland, leaving four people missing, police say.\n\nThe incident took place during US-Australian exercise off Lindeman Island on Friday night.\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles said a search and rescue mission was immediately launched.\n\n\"The four air crew are yet to be found,\" Marles said during a press conference on Saturday morning.\n\nHe said that the MRH-90 Taipan helicopter crashed near the island, in the Whitsundays, at about 22:30 local time (12:30 GMT).\n\n\"Our hopes and thoughts are very much with the aircrew and their families,\" he said, adding that \"we desperately hope for better news during the course of the day\".\n\n\"These are early days and there will be much more information to be provided about this incident,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the same press briefing, the Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell said it was \"a terrible moment\".\n\n\"Our focus at the moment is with finding our people and supporting their families and the rest of our team,\" he said.\n\nHe said he appreciated the support provided by civil agencies, the police, the public and \"our US allies\" to assist the search and rescue operation so far.\n\nThe MRH-90 Taipan went down during drills as part of Exercise Talisman Sabre, the largest bilateral military training exercise between Australian and the United States.\n\nDefence officials announced a pause in the Talisman Sabre exercise, which also includes soldiers from Japan, France, Germany, and South Korea.\n\n\"I've initiated a pause X across Australia for all participants of Talisman Sabre to enable them all, regardless of their nation, to reach out and let their families know what is going on,\" Brigadier Damian Hill, the exercise director of Exercise Talisman Sabre, said.\n\nThe exercise had been entering its second week and was testing large-scale logistics, land combat, amphibious landings and air operations.\n\nIt was expected to wrap up by 4 August.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are both currently in Queensland as part of the annual Australia-US ministerial (AUSMIN) dialogue.", "We are now at the Sir John A MacDonald building across the street from Parliament Hill, where US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are scheduled to speak to members of the media.\n\nThe two were supposed to address media at 15:45 local time, but are currently running a bit behind schedule.\n\nIn the room are dozens of journalists from global news outlets, eager to ask the two leaders questions about a number of pressing issues that were mentioned during Biden's address to parliament.\n\nAmong them is the agreement the two reached on securing the US-Canada border at Roxham Road, which has been criticised by refugee advocates as ineffective to ending the irregular crossing of migrants into Canada.\n\nBiden also spoke on working more closely with Canada on clean energy manufacturing, as well as modernising military assets in the Arctic for defense purposes.\n\nWhile the president did mention the instability in Haiti, it is not clear yet whether a solution has been reached on the issue - the US has asked Canada to lead a military intervention in the Caribbean country, but Canada has resisted, raising questions on how the two countries plan to move forward.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Rishi Sunak says the Acorn project will strengthen the UK's energy security strategy\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the decision to grant 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences.\n\nThe UK government has also said it will support a carbon capture project in the north east of Scotland.\n\nCampaigners said that extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea would \"send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments\".\n\nBut Mr Sunak said granting the new licences was \"entirely consistent\" with net zero commitments.\n\nIt comes as the party faces internal divisions over its green policies - such as the review over low-traffic neighbourhoods in England - with some MPs calling for a rethink.\n\nMr Sunak confirmed support for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, Aberdeenshire, on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, then later visited the site.\n\nIt is one of four carbon capture projects which will share up to \u00a320bn of funding.\n\nMr Sunak said the announcement would support thousands of jobs across the UK.\n\nHe said granting the new oil and gas licences was \"the right thing to do\".\n\nThe Acorn Project will be located at St Fergus gas terminal in Aberdeenshire\n\nHe said: \"Even when we reach net zero in 2050, a quarter of our energy needs will still come from oil and gas and domestic gas production has about a quarter or a third of the carbon footprint of imported gas.\"\n\nThe prime minister also said it made \"absolutely no sense\" to import energy supplies with \"two to three times the carbon footprint of what we have got at home\".\n\nHe said increasing home-grown sources of energy would improve the UK's resilience, create jobs and generate tax revenue to fund public services.\n\nMr Sunak said the government was determined to transition to net zero in a \"proportionate and pragmatic\" way.\n\nAnd he also defended his plans to fly to Scotland as \"an efficient use of time for the person running the country\" and highlighted investment in new technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nThe prime minister said: \"If your approach to climate change is to say that no one should go on holiday, no one should go on a plane, I think you are completely and utterly wrong.\"\n\nThe Acorn project in St Fergus in Aberdeenshire missed out, quite controversially, on track one of funding for this back in 2021.\n\nInstead it went to two projects in the north of England.\n\nThat was highly controversial because there had been heavy hints placed that the Scottish project would form part of that.\n\nIt was one of the most advanced projects in the UK, if not the most advanced, and then suddenly it was dropped.\n\nThe accusation was that the Conservative government at Westminster was favouring Red Wall constituencies following its success at the last general election.\n\nBut it was always the case that this would be a sequencing of events.\n\nBetween the projects announced in 2021 and today 10 mega tonnes of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored by 2030, the UK government says.\n\nThat includes emissions from Mosmorran, from Grangemouth, from a new power station to be built at Peterhead and, potentially, from direct air capture.\n\nIt effectively sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and also stores it.\n\nLabour's Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives' energy policy had left Britain as \"the worst hit country in Western Europe during the energy crisis\".\n\nMr Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: \"Rishi Sunak's weak and confused policy will not take a penny off bills - as his own party chair has admitted - will do nothing for our energy security, and drive a coach and horses through our climate commitments, while continuing to leave us at the mercy of fossil fuel dictators like Putin.\"\n\nAnd Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the new oil and gas licences demonstrated the UK government was \"not serious about tackling the climate emergency\".\n\nHe tweeted: \"For the PM to announce unlimited extraction of oil & gas, in the week the UN has confirmed July is set to be the hottest month in human history, shows the PM is willing to recklessly gamble the future of our planet for cheap political gain.\"\n\nThe St Fergus project is a joint venture between Shell UK and other companies.\n\nIt would become Scotland's first carbon capture and storage facility, which would see harmful greenhouse gas emissions piped under the North Sea.\n\nThis would prevent the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, by capturing it at the point where the fossil fuel is being burnt.\n\nThe UK government said its \"decisive action\" would provide highly-skilled jobs for young people in the region.\n\nIt added this package would \"defend the public\" against the disruption of global energy supplies by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHowever, climate campaigners criticised the decision to award new fossil fuel licences.\n\nOxfam climate change policy advisor Lyndsay Walsh said the announcement was another example of the government's \"hypocritical and dangerously inconsistent climate policy\".\n\nShe added: \"Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.\"\n\nMike Childs, head of policy at environmental charity Friends of the Earth, said the government needed to focus on energy efficiency and home-grown renewable resources rather than \"championing more costly and dirty fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"Climate change is already battering the planet with unprecedented wildfires and heatwaves across the globe.\"\n\nAnd Fabrice Leveque, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said politicians should be focusing on helping households to transition to clean heating rather than \"chasing the mirage of cheap domestic fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"These new licences will do nothing to cut households' energy bills and ignore the best way to boost our energy security - reducing demand for fossil fuels in the first place by insulating homes and replacing oil and gas boilers and vehicles with clean alternatives that run on cheap, homegrown renewables.\"\n\nBurning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the main driver of climate change.\n\nThe carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.\n\nCarbon capture technology is seen by policy makers as a vital tool in reaching the net zero target by the middle of the century.\n\nSome environmentalists, however, are against it because they consider it a distraction from the urgent need to cut emissions.\n\nThe Acorn Project has been under development in various forms for more than a decade.\n\nIt had hoped to be one of the first projects of its kind to receive government backing in 2021, but lost out to two projects in the north of England around the Humber and the Mersey.\n\nSNP Westminster leader and MP for Aberdeen South, Stephen Flynn, said \"broken promises\" had left Scotland's green energy future in jeopardy.\n\nWelcoming the investment, he added: \"There can be no more broken promises or delays. Now is the time to strike on Scotland's green energy potential.\"\n\nThere have been questions raised about the government's ability to meet its 2050 net zero target, with its climate advisers having warned the UK risks falling behind without much faster action.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Sunak said he was committed to meeting the target in a \"pragmatic and proportionate way\" but without \"unnecessarily adding costs and burdens to families\".\n\nNet zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nMr Sunak has faced calls from some Tories to change the deadline for the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesels cars, but told the Sunday Telegraph he was not planning to do so.\n\nThere has also been debate over the expansion of London's ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which was widely seen as helping Conservatives seal a narrow victory in the Uxbridge by-election.\n\nBoth Mr Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have urged London mayor Sadiq Khan to reflect on the rollout as people struggle with cost-of-living pressures.", "Olivia was murdered by Thomas Cashman as he chased a fellow drug dealer into her home\n\nThe mother of murdered schoolgirl Olivia Pratt-Korbel has said she wants to help steer young people away from guns and gangs.\n\nCheryl Korbel, whose daughter was shot by Thomas Cashman as he chased a drug dealer into her home, told the Sunday Mirror she wanted \"violence to stop\".\n\n\"We need to get rid of the gangs [and] give kids opportunities,\" she said.\n\nShe also said she wanted to create a memorial and support a campaign to force criminals to attend sentencings.\n\nMs Korbel told the newspaper she wanted police, charities and the local community to work together on violent crime in the hope it would stop other families from going through what she had.\n\n\"I want the guns to come off the streets and the violence to lessen, if not stop all together,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to get rid of the gangs.\n\n\"Police, communities and charities need to get involved with kids more.\n\n\"We need to give kids opportunities.\"\n\nOlivia was fatally shot by Cashman as he chased a fellow drug dealer into her home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on the evening of 22 August 2022.\n\nHe also injured Ms Korbel as she tried to stop the two men, who the family did not know, from entering the house.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 42 years, refused to enter the dock for his sentencing hearing on Monday, a move which the judge said was \"disrespectful\" to Olivia's family.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Blair Anderson says getting help meant she could \"find my voice to continue to ask for support\"\n\n\"If this service gets taken away there's going to be loads of vulnerable people in deep water.\"\n\nThat is Belfast man Marc Young's stark assessment of the potential loss of funding to hundreds of groups who helped people like him.\n\nAbout \u00a340m in annual funding from the European Social Fund (ESF) is due to stop on 31 March as a result of Brexit.\n\nWhile the UK government has promised to replace the money, it is not clear exactly when and how that will happen.\n\nThat means the jobs of an estimated 1,700 staff in charity and community groups are at risk.\n\nFor Marc and Ballymena woman Blair Anderson, that means the support that they got to turn their lives around may not be available to others.\n\nBlair Anderson faced many problems in her teens.\n\n\"I was a young mum, I'd my daughter at 14 so back then my life looked bleak and I was involved with social services,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"When I say I had no hope for the future, I remember going into a meeting with my social worker and saying like: 'I'm happy to be on the dole, I don't want or need to work because I have the option of being on benefits.'\n\nMarc Young said the opportunity provided by the European Social Fund turned his life around\n\n\"I was involved in anti-social behaviour, I had been arrested and my life was really going down a bad path.\n\n\"I was involved with alcohol and other substances that was impacting my life, impacting my mental health.\"\n\nLike her, Marc also ran into problems at school and on the Shankill Road where he grew up.\n\n\"I had a lot of mental health issues and there was a lot of pressure on me in school to actually do well,\" he said.\n\n\"I just couldn't deal with the pressure growing up being a Protestant young man and I had to keep my emotions to myself.\"\n\nWhile he got to university, he said he lasted \"about two days\" before dropping out.\n\n\"I had no drive, no passion, the only thing I wanted to do was sit in bed,\" he continued.\n\nBut eventually he began a 12-week employability programme run by the Include Youth organisation through the Alternatives group on the Shankill Road.\n\nBlair, meanwhile, started a programme run by Include Youth called Give & Take.\n\nBoth said that had turned their lives around. Both, now in their 20s, are youth workers and back in education.\n\nBoth Blair and Marc spoke at an event held by East Belfast Mission to highlight the risks to groups if the funding is not replaced soon.\n\n\"It was the support that I actually got that motivated me and drove me to do well within my own life, for my family for my friends and for my future,\" Marc said.\n\nFor Blair, getting help meant she could \"find my voice to continue to ask for support\".\n\n\"Many times I failed, many times I had personal circumstances but that didn't impact,\" she said.\n\n\"They supported me with that along with my education, training and employment - something school didn't offer me.\n\n\"There was support provided around my child and being a parent, again something that wasn't accommodated in a school environment.\n\n\"That enabled me to flourish and enabled me to find myself.\"\n\nBoth Blair and Marc spoke at an event held by East Belfast Mission to highlight the risks to groups which help disadvantaged, vulnerable and disabled people if European Social Funding is not replaced soon.\n\nOthers at the meeting described the situation as \"a scandal\".\n\nAbout 30 staff at Include Youth, the organisation which helped Blair and Marc, are among those whose jobs may be lost.\n\nStormont used to top up the ESF money with about \u00a314m a year in matched funding.\n\nBut with no executive it is not clear if that money will be available in 2023-24 either.\n\nThe UK government recently told BBC News NI that its Shared Prosperity Fund would match previous EU funding and increase in the coming years.\n\n\"As EU projects come to an end, funding from UK Shared Prosperity Fund will increase, reaching over \u00a350m for Northern Ireland in 2023-24 and \u00a374m in 2024-25, to spread opportunity, help local businesses and improve pride in place,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nBut with the deadline of 31 March for ESF funding running out less than three weeks away, Blair and Marc fear for the future.\n\n\"If the government doesn't step in or someone doesn't step in to save this service we're ultimately putting the most vulnerable back in an even more vulnerable position, to me that doesn't make sense,\" Blair said.", "The 22 victims of the Manchester Arena bombing\n\nThe Manchester Arena Inquiry was a mammoth undertaking. Evidence was heard over 196 days, presented and pored over by 18 legal teams, and culminating in three reports running into hundreds of pages.\n\nI went to many of the hearings and, while much of what I heard did cast fresh light on the May 2017 bombing, I listened to a lot of the evidence with a sinking heart and a sense of familiarity and deja vu.\n\nAs the BBC's North of England Correspondent, I've also spent many years covering the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in Sheffield - sitting through two years of inquest hearings, and three criminal trials.\n\nThe more I heard at the Arena inquiry, the more it reminded me of Hillsborough.\n\nAnd I wasn't the only one. Several Hillsborough families told me that they had an uncomfortable sense of history repeating itself.\n\nMargaret Aspinall has been a prominent spokesperson for Hillsborough families - pictured in 2016\n\nMargaret Aspinall's son, James, died in the April 1989 disaster - one of 97 Liverpool supporters to have lost their lives. She says seeing what happened at Manchester Arena brought back painful memories. \"You saw people were left again without getting CPR. The main thing is\u2026 lessons have not been learnt.\"\n\nI started to keep a record of the ways the two tragedies seemed to overlap - and quickly realised the seeds of disaster had been sown well before each fateful day.\n\nAt both Hillsborough and Manchester Arena, joint working between the organisations responsible for crowd safety failed. The Hillsborough Inquests found that in the years before the disaster, Sheffield Wednesday FC had not agreed any meaningful contingency plan with South Yorkshire Police - and the club had not been part of a working party, whose other members included South Yorkshire Police, the fire service and local councils.\n\nAt Hillsborough, the club's safety certificate was 10 years old, and hadn't been updated despite changes to the ground which had impacted on capacity and stewarding. A document called The Green Guide was relied on by the club. It was a voluntary code with no legal force and open to interpretation.\n\nIn Manchester - British Transport Police (BTP), Greater Manchester Police, North West Ambulance Service and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service were supposed to work together on a joint planned response to an emergency through a local \"resilience forum\", with meetings every six months.\n\nThe Arena inquiry heard that in the two years leading up to the attack, officers from BTP were only present at a third of those meetings, and those who had attended weren't senior enough.\n\nFor 5 Minutes On, Judith Moritz looks at the many parallels between the Hillsborough and Manchester Arena tragedies - and asks whether history is repeating itself.\n\nThe Manchester inquiry also found the venue's operator SMG UK, and its security contractor Showsec, both had inadequate risk assessments. It also ruled that a breach of the Arena's premises licence - a failure to agree a minimum number of stewards - may have contributed to the fact the attack wasn't prevented.\n\nCompanies working at the Arena were also meant to comply with a document called The Purple Guide, which provides important guidance about health and safety at music and other events. The Manchester inquiry found the Arena's private medical provider ETUK \"fell a long way short of the guidance provided by the Purple Guide\".\n\nBosses admitted \"policing got it badly wrong\" in the aftermath of the 1989 stadium disaster\n\nAt Hillsborough, ambulances lined up outside the ground, but only one South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS) vehicle was allowed onto the pitch with only one paramedic at the Leppings Lane end.\n\nAt Manchester Arena, only one paramedic was inside the foyer for the first 40 minutes. Ambulances arrived outside, but a casualty clearing station was set up away from the area where the bomb went off, and the injured had to be lifted there, rather than being offered help inside the Arena.\n\nAt both Hillsborough and Manchester, important life-saving help was given by members of the public.\n\nOne of the most enduring images of the Hillsborough disaster is that of Liverpool fans carrying the dead and injured on advertising hoardings used as improvised stretchers, in the absence of the real thing.\n\nThe same thing happened at Manchester - with graphic testimony at the public inquiry about what happened to one of the fatalities, 28-year-old John Atkinson, who nearly slid off an advertising board and was then carried out on a section of metal railings.\n\nJohn Atkinson was carried from Manchester Arena on a makeshift stretcher\n\nPete Weatherby KC is a barrister who has represented both Hillsborough and Arena families. He told me some of the similarities were \"pretty shocking\".\n\n\"Something as basic as stretchers in both Hillsborough and the Arena. People who were very, very severely injured and in some cases died, were carried out on advertising hoardings in both cases, 30 years apart. There has to be a rethink here\".\n\nAt Hillsborough, the police radio systems failed and officers outside the ground could not hear instructions or communicate. There was a failure to get through to the police control room.\n\nThe Manchester inquiry heard evidence that not all stewards had radios, and there was confusion about the functionality of the radios issued to some Showsec staff. Their training in how to use the radios was not adequate.\n\nAndrew Roussos and his son outside Manchester Arena following the bomb attack\n\nAt Hillsborough, families desperate for information struggled to get through on jammed phone lines. Many drove to Sheffield to search for loved ones. But on arrival, it was equally impossible to locate relatives - and the way they were treated, added to their trauma.\n\nBarry Devonside was at the match, but not on the Leppings Lane terraces where his son, Christopher, was crushed. Mr Devonside went to the temporary mortuary to look for the 18 year old, but police sent him away. He spent seven hours checking at hospitals and a reception centre before being sent back to the mortuary where his son's body had been lying all along. He then had to look at Polaroid photos of all the deceased in order to identify Christopher.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the story of Andrew Roussos at Manchester Arena bears a horrible resemblance to that of Barry Devonside. Andrew's wife Lisa - and their children Ashlee, 26, and Saffie-Rose, 8 - had been on a \"girls night\" at the arena to watch pop star Ariana Grande.\n\nWhen the bomb exploded at the end of the concert, the three of them were in the arena's foyer. Andrew and his son Xander had been waiting outside nearby to collect them - and were quickly at the scene. But although they found Ashlee straight away, they couldn't find Lisa or Saffie.\n\nThe pair walked round and round the perimeter of the arena, leaving their details with police officers and asking for help. They didn't know that they were yards from Lisa, who was lying inside on the foyer floor - or that Saffie had been carried out of a nearby exit and put into an ambulance.\n\nThey were sent from pillar to post, travelling between three hospitals, until they finally found Lisa in the early hours of the next morning. But Saffie remained missing for 14 hours, until they were finally told that she'd died in the explosion. At the public inquiry, they learned that she was alive when she was taken out of the arena, and had actually died at hospital.\n\nIn 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel published a report which found that 41 of the victims had the potential to have survived, if the emergency response had been different. Barry Devonside's son Christopher was amongst them. Inquests later found he may have lived for two hours after the match was stopped.\n\nThis year, the Manchester Arena Inquiry established that 20 of the 22 people killed in the bombing had died from unsurvivable injuries - but it ruled that it was likely that emergency services' inadequacies had prevented John Atkinson's survival. Inquiry Chairman Sir John Saunders also said he could not rule out the possibility that Saffie-Rose Roussos could have been saved with better treatment.\n\nIn his \"pen portrait\" of Saffie-Rose at the Manchester inquiry, Andrew Roussos said his daughter had \"melted people's hearts\"\n\nThe Hillsborough families have endured the double tragedy of the disaster itself, and also a three-decade-long legal aftermath which has included a public inquiry, two sets of inquests and four trials.\n\nThe Manchester Arena bombing has generated several reviews and reports, and a public inquiry which lasted two years. The Arena inquiry included learning which came directly from Hillsborough. After the first set of Hillsborough Inquests in 1990, which referred to the victims by number, there was a determined effort to put the victims at the heart of the process second time around.\n\nThat's why, in 2014, the new Hillsborough inquests in Warrington began with a \"pen portraits\" process - with every bereaved family invited to speak in court about their loved ones' lives and characters. The experience was seen as positive, and has since been used elsewhere, including at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry.\n\nThe Manchester Arena Inquiry also began with individual pen portrait family tributes to each of the 22 victims - an approach welcomed by the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, who has also worked with Hillsborough families for many years.\n\n\"I think the experience of the Arena families at the inquiry was better than it would have been had it not been for what was revealed about what was so wrong with the original Hillsborough inquests - and how impersonal that was.\"\n\nHowever, not every step of the legal process has been positive for survivors and relatives.\n\nAt both the Hillsborough inquests, and the Manchester Arena Inquiry, survivors applied to be given \"core participant\" status, which would have afforded them legal representation. In both cases, they were denied.\n\nAnne Eyre survived the crush at Hillsborough and it changed her life forever. She went on to become a consultant in emergency planning and disaster management. She established a peer support programme for people affected by the Manchester bombing.\n\nShe says using her lived experiences to help others, who aren't legally core participants, is her way of \"paying it forward\".\n\n\"Regardless of your legal status, it's a constant thing of trying to make sense of an experience where some people around you have died, and you have lived. The randomness of it never leaves you\".\n\nThe Glade of Light memorial in Manchester bears the names of all those killed in the Arena attack\n\nThose affected by both tragedies also speak of their experience of enduring months of courtroom argument, as organisations involved at both Hillsborough and Manchester Arena sought to blame each other.\n\n\"We see a repeat of this tendency of public bodies not to feel able to tell the truth at the first time of asking,\" says Andy Burnham, \"and sadly, that has repeated, not to the same degree, but to some degree with the Manchester Arena Inquiry.\"\n\nThe Greater Manchester mayor is one of those leading the campaign for a \"Hillsborough Law\" - which would give families bereaved through public tragedies financial support for legal representation at inquiries.\n\n\"It's something we need very urgently. People know that mistakes get made - that's life. What people won't forgive is the covering up of those mistakes.\n\n\"And then the pushing of people, already traumatised by their loss, into a wilderness where they're left just trying to fight for change, truth, and answers for years and years to come.\"\n\nThis week, the Government announced the creation of a new role - that of Independent Public Advocate. It's part of an effort to improve care of survivors and families of people killed in major disasters, including by supporting them through the inquiries that follow.\n\nBut it stops short of the full package of measures which some would like to see.\n\n\"The obvious problem with inquiries and inquests is that very often you get a fantastic report and great recommendations - but then it sits on a shelf,\" says Pete Weatherby KC.\n\nBoth Hillsborough and Manchester Arena have resulted in multiple inquiry reports.

The US recently confirmed that 90 Strykers would soon be dispatched.\n\nAmong the other vehicles donated by the US recently were 59 more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. They were used extensively by US forces in Iraq.\n\nIn December, the US also announced it was sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine - and Germany and the Netherlands have recently followed suit.\n\nThis highly sophisticated system has a range of up to 62 miles (100km), depending on the type of missile used, and requires specialised training for Ukrainian soldiers, likely to be carried out at a US Army base in Germany.\n\nBut the system is expensive to operate - one Patriot missile costs around $3m.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, Ukraine has been using Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air systems against Russian attacks.\n\nBefore the conflict began in February, Ukraine had about 250 S-300s and there have been efforts to replenish these with similar systems stockpiled in other former Soviet countries, with some coming from Slovakia.\n\nThe US has also provided Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) to Ukraine. The first Nasams arrived in Ukraine in November.\n\nIn addition, the UK has provided several air defence systems, including Starstreak, designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.\n\nGermany has also provided air defence systems, including the IRIS-T air defence systems which can hit approaching missiles at an altitude of up to 20km.\n\nAmong the long-range rocket launchers sent to Ukraine by the US are the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars. Several European countries have also sent similar systems.\n\nHimars are believed to have been central to Ukraine's success in pushing Russian forces back in the south, particularly in Kherson in November.\n\nCrucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.\n\nThe munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), which is further than the Smerch system on the Russian side.\n\nHimars systems are also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems.\n\nIn the months following the invasion and Russia's retreat from Kyiv, much of the war centred on the east of the country where supplies of artillery to Ukraine were in heavy demand.\n\nAustralia, Canada and the US were among the countries to send advanced M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nThe range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's D-30 towed gun.\n\nNato countries say they are planning to ramp up their supply of shells, because Ukraine has been using them much at a faster rate than they are being delivered.\n\nThey are asking their domestic manufacturers to increase production.\n\nThousands of Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have also been supplied to Ukraine.\n\nThe weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion.\n\nDrones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations.\n\nTurkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.\n\nThe US had repeatedly rebuffed Ukraine's pleas for fighter jets, instead focusing on providing military support in other areas.\n\nBut now, President Joe Biden has announced the US will support providing advanced fighter jets - including US-made F-16s - to Ukraine and also back training Ukrainian pilots to fly them.\n\nThe US endorsement will allow other nations to export their own F-16 jets, as the US legally has to approve the re-export of equipment purchased by allies.\n\nThe UK, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Denmark have welcomed the move and will provide support.\n\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Spencer.

All have denied the allegations.\n\nThe Tate brothers appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nAs he left court Andrew Tate said: \"I love this country... and I look forward to being found innocent.\"\n\nThe brothers were first arrested at their Bucharest home in December before being moved to house arrest in March.\n\nThe indictment deposited with the Bucharest court says that the four defendants formed an organised criminal group in 2021 to commit human trafficking in Romania, but also in other countries including the US and the UK.\n\nIt names seven alleged victims who it says were recruited by the Tate brothers through false promises of love and marriage.\n\nThe alleged victims were later taken to buildings in Ilfov county in Romania where they were intimidated, placed under constant surveillance and control and forced into debt, according to a statement from Romanian prosecutors.\n\nThe defendants allegedly then forced the women to take part in pornography which was later shared on social media.\n\nOne defendant is accused of raping a woman twice in March 2022, the statement adds.\n\nThe trial will not start immediately and is expected to take several years.\n\nA Romanian judge now has 60 days to inspect the case files before it can be sent to trial.\n\nThe media team for the Tate brothers said: \"While this news is undoubtedly predictable, we embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation.\"\n\nIt added that the indictment \"allows us to present a comprehensive body of evidence, diligently collected and prepared over time, which will undoubtedly substantiate the brothers' claims of innocence\".\n\nThere are also separate charges still under investigation which could lead to a separate indictment, including money laundering and trafficking of minors.\n\nIn 2016, Andrew Tate, a British-American former kickboxer, was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.\n\nHe went on to gain notoriety online, with Twitter banning him for saying women should \"bear some responsibility\" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated.\n\nDespite social media bans, he gained popularity, particularly among young men, by promoting what he presented as a hyper-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

We had some people who had travelled from outside the city, not aware that was going on that were then unable to gain access to the property.\n\n\"Getting staff home safely is obviously a really big priority for ourselves, we don't want anybody getting injured or caught up in anything.

The family had made clear their wish to engage with younger generations and stay relevant; and given those subjects increasingly only get content through their phones, the family would also have to go online.\n\nBut for those hoping to get a more authentic glimpse into Imperial Family's day-to-day lives, the 48-hour presence of the @kunaicho_jp account so far might disappoint.\n\n\"When I heard [they] created an Instagram, I quickly checked it out. But of course the emperor wouldn't post 'today's lunch (heart emoji)' or anything like that,\" one fan wrote online.\n\nIn the 70 pictures and five videos uploaded across the kunaicho_jp [Imperial Household] profile so far, Emperor Naruhito, Empress Masako and their widely adored only child, the 22-year-old Princess Aiko feature prominently.\n\nBut a page divulging personal notes, reflections or even just more candid pictures of the royals this is not.\n\nThe British royals - who have had an official Instagram for several years - post different style of images to the new Japanese instagram page\n\nThe gallery so far is pretty formal in tone - just a round up of royal duties these last few months: public appearances, visits to museums, earthquake sites and meetings in drawing rooms with royals from other lands. There's some bonsai and a lot of bowing. A birthday celebration post shows the Emperor and Empress seated at a low table, smiling for the cameras.\n\nInstagram influencers go to great lengths to curate the overall look of their grid - for potential new followers to be won over in one glance by a brand that's cohesive and easy on the eye, a definable aesthetic.\n\nThe Japanese royals appear to have one too. A melange of beige and grey.\n\n\"The account's posts are extremely dull, the same kind of photos it shares in press releases,\" says Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer at Kanda University.\n\nThe Japanese royals hosting a visit with the royals from Brunei\n\nThe captions, written solely in Japanese, so far remain just factual recaps of the event shown in photos. Don't expect a casual first name sign-off just yet or any personal musings from the Emperor.\n\nAnd while they've seized on the Stories function- the tool usually used by Instagram users to post sporadic flashes of life - it appears so far the Imperial Household officials are just using it to showcase the B-roll of event photographs.\n\n\"I don't think that the conservative officials at the IHA have any intention of providing an interactive or entertaining experience for their Instagram followers,\" says Mr Hall.\n\nCrucially, they've also turned the comments off - a trend emerging out of the corporate world, social media analysts note.\n\n\"It stops any brand damage from those platforming their own causes, hijacking of comments\u2026 and basically diluting the content and harming the brand,\" says Mr Hughes, who teaches advertising and marketing at the Australian National University.\n\n\"They may yet change it but I wouldn't expect that as that would open a can of worms and they have very much seen what happens from overseas examples with other royal families.\"\n\nCertainly, while the Japanese royals might be making their online debut 15 years later than the Windsors, the furore over a photoshopped image of the Princess of Wales and her family in recent months would certainly be front of mind.\n\nAfter all, this is a royal family whose Chrysanthemum throne rule and lineage trace millennia, a royal house which did not wish to taint themselves with social media for well over a decade.\n\n\"Expect a very tight and narrow narrative and content as the Japanese royal family want to reinforce their conservative and safe brand image,\" says Mr Hughes. \"There will be no (Prince Harry's autobiography) Spare-style works emerging or any Photoshopped dramas.\"\n\nHe notes too that the Japanese have a slightly different relationship with their royals - more reverential, more respectful.\n\n\"They don't need to provide constant content initially, just more a subtle reinforcement of brand and minimising AI and disinformation and misinformation by controlling what is released and discussed. For me, this is smart brand management,\" says Mr Hughes.\n\nAnd while there have been tabloid scandals in the past, the Imperial Household has worked hard to keep the Crown family clean - by and large, they are still viewed by the Japanese populace as morally upstanding role models.\n\nPosts featuring Princess Aiko, like this one, have received the most likes so far\n\nThe family has long used traditional media channels, photography, newspapers and since the Meji period, TV programmes and weekly magazines to get their message across.\n\n\"However, these mediums were often employed to reinforce their positive yet distant image rather than fostering familiarity with the public,\" says Masafumi Moden, a Japanese Studies lecturer at the Australian National University.\n\nIt seems with Instagram, the family are continuing that strategy.\n\nSocial media might encourage close-ups, but for the Japanese royal family they're content to remain at arms length.", "The US will support the delivery of advanced fighter jets to Ukraine by allowing Western allies to supply American-made F-16s, and by training Ukrainian pilots to use the jets.\n\nIt would certainly be a military boost for Kyiv - but the devil is in the detail.\n\nThe crucial questions are: how many, how quickly, and what weapons will the jets come supplied with?\n\nNo-one doubts the ability of the F-16, which has more than proved itself in conflicts around the world.\n\nThey will be a step up from Ukraine's Soviet era Mig-29s and Su-27s, which fly comparable missions.\n\nThe F-16 radar can see further, allowing hostile aircraft to be engaged at longer ranges.\n\nThey typically come with missiles that do not require the aircraft to maintain a radar lock to hit their target - a capability that Russia currently has, but Ukraine does not.\n\nF-16s can also launch precision bombs guided by laser, GPS, and advanced targeting systems, and are better at targeting and destroying enemy ground-based radars than Ukraine's current fighter jets.\n\nBut it is not yet clear which of these capabilities would be made available to Ukraine if the delivery of the jets goes ahead.\n\nTraining and delivery will also be a challenge for Ukraine. The computer systems on board - such as the avionics - operate in a very different way to Soviet aircraft.\n\nIn combat, pilots need to instinctively select multiple, correct modes in complex scenarios where they are at risk of being overwhelmed by rapidly developing events - a situation known as task-saturation.\n\nImagine as a car driver switching from a Renault to a Mercedes, and having to instantly know the position of the headlight switches, the wipers and the fog lights - all on a hugely more complicated level. It takes time and practice.\n\nUkrainian pilots will receive training on bespoke simulators. But it is also highly likely they would have been practising on commercially available software, which delivers a very close representation of the workflow required to operate an F-16.\n\nNumbers are also key. It is little use sending half a dozen jets which on their own might be vulnerable to the mighty Su-35s operated by Russia.\n\nCombat aircraft are most effective in packages where jets are grouped together for certain roles - all to carry out one specific mission.\n\nFor example, if the mission is to neutralise an enemy radar installation, you might want a \"four-ship\" comprising four jets to carry the missiles or the bombs to destroy that structure.\n\nThat role is called a Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) strike. But you do not want that critical flight itself to be vulnerable to attack.\n\nSo you might have another four aircraft flying ahead in a \"SEAD escort\" role, armed with air-to-air weapons, to protect the SEAD strike from enemy planes.\n\nThe point is all this requires many aircraft, and they need to be supported by other assets.\n\nThat would include surveillance planes to warn about enemy fighters in the area, ground maintenance crews to ensure the upkeep of the jets and having, of course, the necessary infrastructure to take off and land safely.\n\nSo the US decision to give the OK to other nations to supply F-16s marks the start of a complicated process and much work will be required to get to delivery.\n\u2022 None Biden to let allies supply F-16s in boost for Kyiv", "Former prime minister Boris Johnson has resigned as an MP and announced he is stepping down with immediate effect.\n\nIn a lengthy statement the ex-PM accused a Commons investigation of attempting to \"drive me out\".\n\nMr Johnson first became and MP in 2001, representing the constituency of Henley in Oxfordshire, since then he went on to become the Mayor of London, MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and then the prime minister.\n\nHere's a look back at his political career.", "Tia and other Year 12 students will be taking mock exams in the school hall on Wednesday, when teachers are going on strike\n\nIn the Sixth Form study room, Tia is twizzling a pink fluffy pen around in her hand. She is nervous about her mock IT exam next week.\n\n\"This is my one practice, and then I've got the real one,\" she says.\n\nOn Wednesday, she will be among the only pupils attending Wales High School in Rotherham, which is due to close because of a staff walk-out over pay.\n\nThe decision to close has been \"horrible\", says head teacher Pepe DiIasio. Only Year 12s taking mock exams, vulnerable pupils, and the children of critical workers will be expected in.\n\n\"Students have missed an awful lot of time in the last three years, and we don't want them to miss any more,\" he says.\n\nPepe DiIasio says he has heard the strikes described as \"10 years in the making\" because of teachers' pay and conditions\n\nPepe's office, a short walk and a few flights of stairs from the study room, is the HQ of this hub of 1,900 pupils. He has been busy preparing for Wednesday - sending letters to parents, making sure those who have children on free school meals get funds for lunches, and allocating laptops to children who need them for online learning.\n\nSome parents have criticised school closures on social media, arguing that families are fined if they keep their children out of school - but Pepe hasn't had any complaints like that.\n\nPlanning ahead is tricky because members of the National Education Union (NEU), which is co-ordinating the strike in England and Wales, don't have to tell their heads whether they will take part.\n\nAs the former president of the Association of School and College Leaders, Pepe is well aware of this. However, about 30 members of staff have told him that they won't be at work, and he estimates the total number could be more than 50.\n\n\"One of the gifts of Covid is that we're fully prepared for this sort of situation, and what we can do is move into a remote curriculum virtually straight away,\" he says.\n\nTeachers on strike also don't have to set work to cover strike days. Here, it is up to senior leaders like assistant head teacher Hannah Feerick to prepare work for pupils to do at home.\n\n\"They'll just follow their timetable as they would do on a normal Wednesday,\" she says. \"So if they have Maths first thing, then they'll do the Maths work for the first hour.\"\n\nThe school library will serve as a temporary classroom for pupils who are coming in - but Hannah won't know how many this will be until the morning itself.\n\nHannah Feerick will be supervising pupils in the school library.\n\nShe hopes lessons can be learnt for further NEU strikes in February and March.\n\n\"Hopefully if we get something that works for everybody, then we can just pick that up and reapply it.\"\n\nDownstairs in the science technician rooms, the chorus of \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" is blasting out from a radio tucked behind a row of plants. This part of the school is a retreat for Jo Smethurst, the science resource manager, who spends much of her day marching between labs and checking the step count on her leopard-print smart watch.\n\nJo is not a member of teaching staff and won't be on strike, but she may not be able to work because of her own childcare issues. She says it has been \"stressful\" checking every morning for an email from her son's primary school about whether or not it will be closing.\n\n\"I'm trying to look around to see if I can get grandparents so I can get some childcare for that day. Or I will have to have the day off, or his dad will have to have the day off,\" she says - which could hit their income, as he is self-employed.\n\nManaging the science technicians is among Jo Smethurst's jobs at Wales High School.\n\nDespite her childcare jigsaw, she is broadly in agreement with the teaching staff going on strike, because of the rising cost of living.\n\n\"Fuel, gas, electricity - everything's going up,\" she says. \"We want our wages to go up and teachers want their wages to go up.\"\n\nAround the corner from Pepe's office, with a green pen in hand, Ross Napier is rattling through a pile of Year 13 Economics essays.\n\nRoss represents NEU members in the school, and plans to strike on Wednesday. He left industry in the mid-1990s to teach because it was an \"attractive profession\", he says - but that has changed because of the \"erosion of pay\".\n\nHis partner is also a teacher, and they lived \"happily on one-and-a-half salaries\" for 12 years, while she worked reduced hours after having children. Then she went back full-time.\n\n\"We're worse off now in real terms than we were when my partner was working part-time,\" he says.\n\nRoss Napier will be taking part in an NEU rally in Sheffield\n\nRoss DJs at the weekends - house music, mostly - to help pay their bills and mortgage.\n\n\"The extra income allows me to stay in teaching when so many leave,\" he says. \"I love the job.\"\n\nRoss says he hasn't picked up on much chatter about the strikes among his non-NEU colleagues because \"most teachers don't really have the time to go into the staff room\". Last summer he had to give up a role as head of house, because he didn't have the time during the working week.\n\nMost of his students will be taking exams this year, so for him, striking is a \"massive decision to make\", but he adds: \"One day of strike isn't nearly as big an impact as the last 12 years of cuts.\"\n\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb has told the BBC that the government is concerned about agreeing pay rises in line with inflation, which he said would mean embedding inflation into the economy.\n\nThe Department for Education, which has been in talks with teaching unions over pay, has advised that schools remain open for \"as many pupils as possible\" - and the picture will vary across schools in England and Wales.

Watch: Scenes of destruction at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza\n\nIsrael's military has pulled out of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after a two-week raid that has left most of the major medical complex in ruins.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of bodies had been found and locals said nearby areas were razed.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had killed 200 \"terrorists\", detained over 500 more and found weapons and intelligence \"throughout the hospital\".\n\nThe IDF said it raided al-Shifa because Hamas had regrouped there.\n\nThe two-week operation saw intense fighting and Israeli air strikes in nearby buildings and the surrounding area.\n\nWards were attacked because Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives were using them as a base, the IDF said, accusing them of fighting inside medical departments, setting off explosives and burning hospital buildings.\n\nImages published following the Israeli withdrawal showed Palestinians walking near the charred main buildings with chunks of wall missing and carrying bodies wrapped in blankets. Graphic photos showed corpses partially exposed on the churned ground.\n\nThe health ministry said dozens of bodies, some decomposed, had been found in and around the medical complex, which was now \"completely out of service\".\n\nA doctor told AFP news agency more than 20 bodies had been recovered, some crushed by withdrawing vehicles.\n\nPalestinians say numerous bodies were found after Israeli forces withdrew\n\nA spokesperson for Gaza's Hamas-run civil emergency service said Israeli forces had used bulldozers to dig up the grounds of the complex and exhume buried bodies.\n\nThe Hamas government media office said Israeli forces had killed 400 Palestinians in al-Shifa and the surrounding area, including a female doctor and her son, who was also a doctor.\n\nIn an update, IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the IDF had taken \"special efforts not to harm any patients, any medical staff, or any civilians in the area.\n\n\"Patients who remained in the compound were provided with medical supplies and water.\"\n\nHe added that 200 people he described as \"terrorists\" had been killed. Over 900 people were detained, of whom more than 500 were, he said, subsequently found to be affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which Israel, the UK and other countries proscribe as terrorist organisations. Interrogation of the suspects had yielded \"significant intelligence\", he added.\n\nEarlier, the IDF said \"forces found large quantities of weapons, intelligence documents throughout the hospital, encountered terrorists in close-quarters battles and engaged in combat while avoiding harm to the medical staff and patients\".\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday night that 21 patients had died, with patients moved a number of times and held without medical care.\n\nDr Amira al-Safady at al-Shifa told the BBC's Gaza Lifeline radio that about 16 people who were in the intensive care unit died after being moved, because she and other doctors no longer had the equipment to treat them.\n\nThree days later, troops told medical staff to bury them outside, she said.\n\nThe IDF has been asked for comment. It says troops set up temporary infrastructure for medical treatment at al-Shifa, with video showing troops setting up a small number of beds.\n\nThe hospital - previously Gaza's biggest - is completely out of service, the Hamas-run health ministry says\n\nPatient Barra al-Shawish told Reuters news agency that the Israeli troops had allowed in a \"very small amount of food\". \"No treatment, no medicine, nothing, and bombing for 24 hours that didn't stop and immense destruction in the hospital,\" he said.\n\nSome of the patients were being moved to al-Ahli hospital, about 3km (1.8 miles) to the south-east, a medic at al-Shifa told Reuters.\n\nGaza's hospitals have been a main focus of the current war, with thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment in their grounds and Israeli forces storming the facilities because they say Hamas fighters are present there.\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of using civilian health infrastructure as a cover to launch its operations, which the group denies.\n\nTwo weeks ago, it took hundreds of Israeli forces just a few hours to approach and enter the Gaza Strip's largest hospital. That was in marked contrast to their first controversial raid there in November, when it took several weeks for large numbers of tanks and vehicles, backed by heavy air strikes, to close in on the site.\n\nFor supporters of the Israeli military, this has been evidence of the gains it has made during the war and its tactical success, launching a surprise attack on the enemy to strike it hard. An IDF spokesman previously referred to the operation as \"one of the most successful of the war so far\" because of the intelligence gleaned, as well as numbers killed and detained.\n\nLarge parts of the neighbourhood surrounding al-Shifa have been flattened\n\nHowever, some commentators suggest the second al-Shifa raid highlights flaws in Israel's military strategy for the war. They argue that it shows the ease with which Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters were able to regroup after Israel pulled its forces out of northern Gaza and the urgent need to come up with a convincing post-war plan to govern the territory.\n\nOn Monday, the Gaza health ministry appealed for international help to restart medical care at Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The biggest hospital in southern Gaza has been out of action since the Israeli military stormed it in February.\n\nThe war began when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About 130 of the hostages remain in captivity, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\n\nMore than 32,800 Palestinians have been killed and 75,000 injured in Gaza since Israel launched its military campaign, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says 70% of those killed were women and children.", "President Joe Biden has said a bipartisan deal to raise the US debt ceiling and avert a fast-approaching default is ready to move to Congress.\n\nHe said on Sunday the agreement was a \"compromise\", while Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier called it \"worthy of the American people\".\n\nThey must now convince members of Congress to approve it.\n\nThe proposed deal is the result of long and bitter negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe Treasury had warned the US will run out of money on 5 June without a deal.\n\nThe US must borrow money to fund the government because it spends more than it raises in taxes.\n\nRepublicans have been seeking spending cuts in areas such as education and other social programmes in exchange for raising the $31.4tn (\u00a325tn) debt limit.\n\nAt a brief appearance before reporters on Sunday evening, President Biden said the proposed deal was \"a really important step forward\".\n\n\"It takes a threat of catastrophic default off the table, protects our hard earned and historic economic recovery.\n\n\"And the agreement also represents a compromise which means no one got everything they want, but that's the responsibility of governing.\"\n\nMr Biden said he believed Mr McCarthy had negotiated in \"good faith\" and now had the votes for the deal to be backed in Congress.\n\nThe proposed deal has now been published on the House website.\n\nIt envisages that non-defence government spending would be kept largely flat for two years and then rise by 1% in 2025.\n\nThere would be no major changes to Medicaid health insurance, and the proposed agreement fully funds medical care for veterans.\n\nLaws are to be streamlined to speed up approval time for new energy projects - a reform Republicans have been pushing for.\n\nCovid relief funds that have not been spent will be clawed back in the agreement, another demand made by the Republicans.\n\nCertain age changes are proposed for a government programme that provides food-purchasing assistance for people on low or no incomes.\n\nLate on Saturday, news came of a tentative deal - but it took until Sunday for negotiations to continue and the agreement to be finalised.\n\nMr McCarthy on Saturday said these reforms would lift people out of poverty and into the workforce. He added: \"There are no new taxes, no new government programmes.\"\n\nBut he now faces a challenge to push it through the House, where it may be opposed by some diehards among both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMr McCarthy said more than 95% of House Republicans were very excited about the deal.\n\nBut some have already broken ranks - Republican Chip Roy of Texas said he and some others were going to try to stop it passing.\n\nRepublicans control the House by 222 to 213, while Democrats control the Senate by 51 to 49.\n\nA US default would upend the US economy and disrupt global markets.\n\nIn the US, the immediate effect would be that the government would quickly run out of funds to pay for welfare benefits and other support programmes, for instance.\n\nOver a long period, the crisis would tip the US economy into recession - and this would result in unemployment rising.\n\nA US recession would have big knock-on effects for many countries around the world, for which the US is a key trading partner - they would not be able to sell to an economy that does not buy as much.\n\nAnd because the US dollar is the reserve currency of the world, a default would send panic across the world, eventually leading to prices of many commodities rising.", "Nearly five million patients each month in England wait more than a fortnight for a GP appointment, NHS figures show, which Labour is calling \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe government says it expects all patients needing a GP appointment to be seen within two weeks.\n\nThe Royal College of GPs says 85% of appointments happen within two weeks and nearly half on the same day.\n\nThose taking longer than two weeks may be routine ones for which the wait is therefore appropriate, it says.\n\nProf Kamila Hawthorne, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \"GPs and our teams are working tirelessly to deliver safe, timely and appropriate care and to give patients the choice of appointment they want.\n\n\"We share our patients' frustration when they struggle to access our care. However, this is not down to GPs and their hard-working teams, but due to decades of underfunding and poor resource planning.\"\n\nGPs were delivering more appointments overall than before the pandemic but with fewer full-time fully qualified staff.\n\nThere are about 30 million GP appointments each month in England.\n\nLabour shadow health and social care secretary Wes Streeting gave a speech on primary health care on Friday, repeating a party promise to train 7,500 more doctors and 10,000 more nurses a year.\n\nMr Streeting said: \"Patients are finding it impossible to get a GP appointment when they need one, after 13 years of Conservative broken promises and understaffing of the NHS.\n\n\"These unacceptable waiting times mean illness will go undiagnosed for longer, while patients are left in pain and discomfort for weeks or even months.\n\n\"Labour will fix the front-door to the NHS, starting by doubling medical-school places so we train 7,500 extra doctors and 10,000 more nurses a year.\"\n\nThe Conservative government says it is expanding the primary-care workforce.\n\nA party spokesman defended its record on doctor recruitment, saying: \"If Labour were serious about cutting waiting lists, they would have backed our plan to get more doctors into the NHS. Instead, they voted to send doctors into early retirement.\n\n\"Labour's latest unfunded scheme to restructure the NHS has been slammed by doctors as 'dangerous' and costing 'a fortune'.\n\n\"Meanwhile, in the past 12 months in England, we have recruited over 5,100 more doctors - making it easier to see a GP and helping to cut waiting lists.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, say they would recruit an extra 8,000 GPs to \"guarantee people a right to an appointment within one week, so people can get the care they deserve\".\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Head teacher Ruth Perry took her own life in January\n\nThe school run by a head teacher who took her own life after a critical Ofsted report has been rated as good after a new inspection.\n\nRuth Perry died in January after being told Caversham Primary School in Berkshire was being downgraded from outstanding to inadequate.\n\nThe school was re-inspected after Ms Perry's death, which prompted an outpouring of anger about the system.\n\nOfsted has defended its one-word grades, which are not being scrapped.\n\nThe head teacher's sister Prof Julia Waters said it was a \"very bittersweet moment\", but confirmed \"what anyone who knew Ruth and the school knew all along\".\n\nShe said one-word grades do not give an accurate reflection of the strengths and weaknesses \"of a complex organisation like a school\".\n\nHer sister's case showed how it is \"terribly, potentially fatally dangerous to try to sum up everything in one word\", she told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight programme.\n\nHer loss has been \"absolutely devastating to so many people\" she said, adding: \"The ripple effect of her death is immeasurable.

It won't consider the circumstances around Ruth Perry's death, which will be examined by a coroner.\n\nThe new report said useful advice was sought from beyond the school straight after the last inspection.\n\n\"In particular, this helped leaders to understand fully the extent of the weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements and prioritise what needed to be done,\" the report said.\n\nIn a statement, the head teacher's sister Ms Waters said staff at the school who had worked with or been trained by Ms Perry had never been anything other than \"excellent, caring and professional\".\n\nShe added: \"The reversal of the previous judgement in a matter of a few months illustrates why schools should be given the opportunity to correct any technical weaknesses before the final report is published.\n\n\"An inspection should be about helping schools with independent scrutiny, not catching them out and publicly shaming them.\"\n\n\"That Ruth was left feeling suicidal as a result of Ofsted's previous judgement demonstrates, in the most tragic way possible, the intolerably high stakes created by the current inspection system,\" she added.\n\nAn inquest later this year will fully investigate Ms Perry's death, which also prompted a wider debate about whether one-word grades for schools make sense.\n\nIn their latest report Ofsted said the arrangements for safeguarding at Caversham Primary School were effective.\n\n\"A positive culture of safeguarding now pervades the school,\" it added.\n\nLast month, Ofsted announced changes to its inspection system.\n\nThese included allowing schools that were given an inadequate rating over safeguarding to be re-inspected within three months, giving them a chance to be re-graded if they have addressed concerns.\n\nOfsted previously said it always strived to make inspections \"as positive an experience for school staff as they can be\".\n\nMPs have now launched an inquiry into Ofsted's school inspections, looking at how useful they are to parents, governors and schools in England.\n\nAmanda Spielman, the watchdog's chief inspector, previously told the BBC the \"whole school accountability system\" was built around the one-word judgements.\n\nShe acknowledged there were issues around accountability at schools but said scrapping one-word judgements \"wouldn't really solve the underlying discomfort\".\n\nThe Department for Education has also defended one-word inspections.\n\nIt said they \"succinctly summarise independent evaluations on the quality of education, safeguarding, and leadership which parents greatly rely on to give them confidence in choosing the right school for their child\".\n\nIt said the government used them to \"highlight success, identify schools that need support and to trigger intervention where necessary.\"\n\nWatch the story of head teacher, Ruth Perry, who took her life after her school's rating was downgraded by Ofsted.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The barge has already attracted sightseers to the cliffs overlooking Portland Port\n\nA barge that will house asylum seekers under government plans to cut the cost of housing has docked in a Dorset port.\n\nBibby Stockholm berthed in Portland Port on Tuesday and will stay at the site for 18 months, becoming home to 500 single men claiming asylum.\n\nIt was met with protests from local residents and human rights groups.\n\nThe vessel's arrival came hours after the government's Illegal Migration Bill cleared key hurdles in the House of Lords and is set to become law.\n\nThe bill would outlaw asylum claims by all arrivals via the Channel and other \"illegal\" routes, and transfer them to third countries like Rwanda.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made cracking down on illegal migration a priority ahead of next year's general election.\n\nIt comes as the government said there were currently about 51,000 \"destitute migrants\" in hotels across the UK, costing the taxpayer in excess of \u00a36m a day.\n\nMany local residents on Portland feared an influx of hundreds of people into the island community would put pressure on local services, such as schools and the NHS. But the government said it was providing \"substantial funding to local services including the police and NHS\" to support the asylum seekers and \"minimise the impact on the community\".\n\nHuman rights groups branded the barge \"inhumane\", criticising the conditions in which the migrants will live.\n\nBut the government said using vessels as alternative accommodation for asylum seekers would be cheaper than hotels and better value for British taxpayers.\n\nIt also stressed the barge would be basic but functional, meeting all the relevant safety standards.\n\nThe 222-room, three-storey barge will house adult males, aged from 18 to 65, who are in the latter stages of their asylum applications.\n\nHuman rights groups say the barge is not suitable for 500 people\n\nDozens of protestors gathered outside Portland Port from dawn on Tuesday, waiting for the Bibby Stockholm to make its final manoeuvre into the port.\n\nOne of them told the BBC the deal between Portland Port and the Home Office to dock the barge in the Dorset port was \"nothing to do about anything other than money\".\n\n\"They are audaciously negligent,\" the protestor said, adding: \"Audacious - because they have done this deal without any consultation or any thought of any potential fallout.\"\n\nOther organisations, such as Stand Up to Racism, also joined Tuesday's protests, while many local residents voiced their anger over how the decision was taken.\n\nThe first 50 asylum seekers are expected to go aboard in the next few days, while the barge is set to reach its full capacity in the coming weeks.\n\nDorset Council previously said Portland Port was not the right location for the barge\n\nThe asylum seekers are expected to live on the vessel for about three to six months while their claims are dealt with.

They have also had their fingerprints and identities recorded.\n\nWhile the government said it needed to reduce the cost of housing asylum seekers, shadow home secretary Labour Yvette Cooper described the use of barges as \"a sign of the Conservatives' total failure to clear the asylum backlog\".\n\nThe Conservative MP for Dorset South, Richard Drax, said he had \"a lot of sympathy with the government\" as migrants continue to cross the English Channel.\n\n\"But putting them on a barge is not the answer,\" he added.\n\nThe asylum seekers are expected to live on the vessel for about three to six months\n\nBibby Stockholm was previously used to house homeless people and asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands.

They say \"it's time we show them who rules this country\".\n\nDarren Nesbit, editor of the Light, defended calls in his paper to use force against \"aggressors\" in power, telling the BBC it would be a matter of \"self-defence\" in circumstances such as the government ordering another lockdown or what he described as forced evacuations.\n\nBundles of copies of the Light were piled up at the protest in Totnes, Devon\n\nHe says he isn't in charge of the Light's Telegram channels, although acknowledges they are directly linked to the paper. Posts are sometimes signed off by the \"Light Paper Team\" and sometimes with his name.\n\nMr Nesbit says he speaks to the editor of the conspiracy theory newspaper in Germany, Demokratischer Widerstand (Democratic Resistance) - which is connected to a failed coup attempt in the country - \"two or three times a year\". He has published content endorsing the publication.\n\nThe German paper refers to the Light as its \"partner\" paper and its \"colleagues\" at the British publication, describing how they're \"internationally connected\".\n\nReferring to concerns about the wider conspiracy theory movement more generally, the UK's Head of Counter Terrorism Policing Matt Jukes has told the BBC they are currently \"seeing evidence of conspiracy theories being interwoven with extremism\" and that this \"connection is very much on our radar and in our sights as investigators\".\n\nSet up in 2020 as a print publication, the Light is distributed in about 30 places across the UK such as Brighton, Thetford, Stroud, Plymouth, Oxford, Bristol, Manchester and Glastonbury. Local conspiracy theory groups place bulk orders and distribute them on the streets for free.\n\nIn the Devon town of Totnes, a motivated minority have been distributing the Light for the past two years. Its former town Mayor Ben Piper says he first became a key target of the conspiracy theory movement there because of his role enforcing coronavirus restrictions.\n\nFormer mayor of Totnes Ben Piper says \"aggression\" in articles about him inflamed harassment over Covid restrictions\n\nHe fears an article about him in the Light exacerbated the harassment he experienced - from abuse in the street, to sinister phone calls, to someone driving a car at him.\n\n\"There was an aggression that bled through the editorial that was not as innocent as it was making out to be,\" he says.\n\nThe Light's editor, Darren Nesbit, is based near Manchester. He agreed to speak to me, only on the condition that he can ask me questions and record the interview too.\n\nFor him, everything from financial turmoil to climate change and 9/11 terror attacks in the US are part of a plan by governments to control and harm our lives. He thinks the pandemic was just one step towards doing that.\n\nThe paper has featured an article by a blogger called Lasha Darkmoon, saying that people should be able to question the Holocaust. And another article recommended a book by white supremacist Eustace Mullins - author of The Biological Jew and Adolf Hitler: An Appreciation. Mullins is referred to in the Light as a \"renowned\" author.\n\n\"If they write good articles on topics that are useful topics that are interesting to people, then we should [feature them] at the end of the day,\" Mr Nesbit says. He reiterates again and again that \"people should be adults and make their own decisions\".\n\n\"My aim is not to do anything else apart from get to the truth and then obviously let other people have a bash at seeing that information as well.\"\n\nThe Light directly defended a UK-based radio host called Graham Hart over antisemitic remarks he made on his show referring to Jewish people as \"filth\" and like \"rats\", suggesting \"they deserve to be wiped out\". He was sentenced to 32 months in prison for making the remarks.\n\nDarren Nesbit defends the paper's right to publish opinions associated with the far right\n\nWhile Mr Nesbit says those comments were \"pretty harsh\", he maintains that the paper defends the radio host's \"right to say it\".\n\nI ask him whether he thinks calls for action in the paper could result in action that's not peaceful.\n\nHe replies, \"Of course, people can make their own decisions, and they need to be responsible for their own actions.\"\n\nHe tells me that the paper doesn't \"actually necessarily call for action\". But, Mr Nesbit also says, \"People should not be passive and just let the world change around them because there is, you know, an agenda and a purpose behind it.\"\n\nI directly ask him, \"Why don't you say there's no place for violence in our movement?\"\n\nHe replies, \"Because I might be wrong.\"\n\nThroughout the interview, Mr Nesbit condemns violent action - and then gives cryptic answers, which seem to contradict that.\n\nTelegram has not responded to the BBC's request for comment about why it has allowed the Light and other conspiracy theory papers to share violent and hateful rhetoric.\n\nResearch carried out by King's College London backs up the idea that calls to action endorsed by conspiracy theory media like the Light could be affecting attitudes.\n\nA survey, commissioned by the BBC, suggested that an average of 61.5% of people - who said they would have attended rallies linked to common conspiracy theories, such as anti-vaccine beliefs - think violence could be justified at protests. They were more likely to think this if they read conspiracy theory media including the Light.\n\n\"Built within these theories [are] inherent demands to do something, to take direct action,\" says research team member Dr Rod Dacombe, who has studied the Light.\n\n\"We shouldn't get away from [how] this occasionally moves into either violence or some sort of violent right action. Not everybody who goes to a protest is going to be brought in by this. Most people won't, right? But some people will.\"\n\nMarkus Haintz, who used to write for the German paper linked to the Light, says its editor is an \"extremist\"\n\nAs well as links with the German paper Demokratischer Widerstand, The Light has related papers in Ireland, Canada and Australia.\n\nTwo whistleblowers spoke to the BBC over concerns about how radical they say the German paper has become.\n\nThey say some of the Demokratischer Widerstand's writers and a key donor to the paper met the Reichsburger group behind a failed coup attempt in Germany in December 2022.\n\nOne of the whistleblowers, lawyer Markus Haintz, who stopped writing for the paper in 2022, says the editor, Anselm Lenz, is an \"extremist\" which he defines as someone who \"brings people in a position where they at least could think about getting violent\".\n\nMr Haintz also says members of the wider conspiracy theory movement in Germany have been offered money by Kremlin-linked figures to push disinformation.\n\nThe other, Martin Le Jeune, who stopped writing for the paper in 2021 says it is creating a \"hateful and divided\" atmosphere, where \"somebody who could be emotional or psychologically unstable could be triggered to do something terrible\".\n\nThe editor of the German conspiracy paper, Mr Lenz, did not reply directly to any of the points raised by the BBC. He called me \"a highly paid Nato and BBC Propagandist'' and said I was a threat to him and his family. He also accused me of slander of \"our friends of the great English democratic movement\".\n\n\"If needed, we are willing to take the fight by all means,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat happened to the people who fell down the rabbit hole into a world of conspiracy theories during the pandemic?\n\nListen to the podcast Marianna in Conspiracyland on BBC Sounds and on BBC Radio 4.\n\nAnd click to watch Conspiracyland: UK? on iPlayer (UK only)", "US President Joe Biden has praised Northern Ireland's young people, saying they are at the \"cutting edge\" of its future during his visit to Belfast.\n\nEarlier he met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak before briefly speaking to some of Stormont's political party leaders.\n\nHe is on a four-day visit to Ireland to mark 25 years since the Good Friday peace agreement, which ended decades of violent conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe hailed the \"tremendous progress\" since the deal was signed in 1998.\n\n\"This place is transformed by peace; made technicolour by peace; made whole by peace,\" he said.\n\nHe hailed Northern Ireland as a \"churn of creativity\", having produced some of the world's most popular films and TV series over the past decade, and said that major economic opportunities for the region were \"just beginning\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

claims for which France said there was no evidence.\n\nBut in his account of the phone call, Mr Shoigu said: \"The Kyiv regime does nothing without the approval of its western minders.

It may go on for months.\n\nA political watchdog group and centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid plan to petition the Supreme Court to annul the new law.\n\nMoreover, Israel's Histadrut trade union confederation has threatened a general strike and thousands of military reservists, including air force pilots, have vowed to not report for duty if the law is allowed to stand.\n\nFor a country that prides itself on its ability to respond fast to any kind of threat, the fact that Israel's very security might be compromised is causing real anxiety.\n\nMr Netanyahu has insisted the law is necessary for the government to \"carry out policy in line with the decision of the majority of the citizens of the country\".\n\nBut he said he was willing to resume talks with the opposition, even until November, to find an all-inclusive agreement.\n\nThe planned reforms have triggered some of the biggest protests in Israel's history. On Monday at least 22 people were arrested, police said.\n\nOpponents fear the changes could undermine the country's democratic system, tipping it into authoritarian territory.\n\nThey worry that nationalist and ultra-Orthodox religious parties allied to Mr Netanyahu will be able to shape policy with unchecked power.\n\nBut the government argues that the reforms are necessary to correct an imbalance in power which has seen the courts increasingly intervene in political decisions.\n\nThe so-called \"reasonableness\" bill was approved by 64 votes to 0, after the opposition boycotted the final vote.\n\nMounted police tried to move protesters off Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv\n\nThe White House - a key ally of Israel - called it \"unfortunate\" that the law had been passed.\n\nThe vote brings to a head months of turmoil, with Israel's president warning political leaders on Monday that the country was \"in a state of national emergency\".\n\nThe street protests outside the Knesset lasted all of Monday, amid a cacophony of noise from drums, whistles and air horns.\n\nA demonstrator lying in the street told the BBC he was defying \"dictatorship\", adding that his grandfather had been a wartime codebreaker against the Nazis at the UK's famous Bletchley Park.\n\nAsked how long he would stay put he said: \"We will never surrender\".\n\nAnother, Reut Yifat Uziel, the daughter of a paratrooper pictured in an iconic Israeli photograph of the capture of the Western Wall in the 1967 Middle East war, said she feared for her children's future.\n\n\"Netanyahu kidnapped the country and I am worried it will become a theocracy,\" she said.\n\nReut Yifat Uziel said she feared for her children's future\n\nThe protesters - tens of thousands of whom marched some 45 miles (70km) from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at the end of last week - set up camp in a park between the Knesset and the Supreme Court, which are located almost next to each other.\n\nMr Netanyahu was in parliament for the vote hours after being discharged from hospital following unscheduled surgery for a pacemaker on Saturday.\n\nThe controversial reforms have polarised Israel, triggering one of the most serious domestic crises in the country's history.\n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets weekly since the start of the year in protest at what they say is an attack on democracy.\n\nFormer heads of Israel's security services, chief justices, and prominent legal and business figures have also been vocal against the government's reforms.\n\nThe measures have also been criticised by the US President Joe Biden, who in his most explicit comments yet called for the \"divisive\" reforms to be postponed.", "Officers in England and Wales have met a target to attend every domestic burglary scene, police chiefs have said.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) made the pledge in a new set of standards announced last year.\n\nThe NPCC's Deputy Chief Constable Alex Franklin-Smith said they wanted to end the \"postcode lottery\" on policing.\n\nBut he said the policy had only had a modest impact so far on how many burglaries were being solved.\n\nA report in August 2022 by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found most victims of burglary, robbery and theft were not getting the justice they deserved.\n\nAnnouncing the target, the NPCC cited College of Policing evidence suggesting higher rates of attendance after a burglary would make victims feel safer and help with investigations.\n\nNow the NPCC has announced that all 43 forces in England and Wales had successfully implemented the new policy by March this year.\n\nDCC Franklin-Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the target being met was a positive step and would help remove regional discrepancies in the quality of policing.\n\nHe explained: \"Police chiefs up and down the country want to make sure that there isn't a postcode lottery when it comes to reporting and being a victim of such crime.\n\n\"It's great that we're able to make sure that there is this consistency in response - if you do phone your local force, you will get a response, and we will do everything we can do to identify those responsible.\"\n\nThere were more than 271,000 incidents of burglary recorded by police in 2022, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.\n\nBut according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is carried out by Kantar Public on behalf of the ONS, actual rates are much higher because of the number of crimes which go unreported.\n\nThe figures from both show the number of burglaries has been gradually coming down over the last 10 years.\n\nDCC Franklin-Smith said the number recorded by the police had fallen by 50% and levels were now back to pre-Covid levels after rising during the pandemic.\n\nBut according to the NPCC, the number of people brought to justice for the crime remains low. Less than 5% of burglaries across England and Wales were solved in 2021/22.\n\nAsked if the policy was leading to a rise in the number of burglaries being solved, DCC Franklin-Smith said: \"We're seeing a slight increase,\" but he cautioned: \"I think it would be wrong at this stage... to try and claim that we're seeing significant increases.\"\n\nThe Home Office has also created a new way of recording burglaries to make it clearer when a home has been entered by the perpetrator.\n\nThe NPCC said that previously a thief entering a home \"was treated the same as the loss of a spade from a shed\" in the data.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said she was \"delighted\" to see the commitment fulfilled, adding: \"This will help increase public confidence and see more criminals caught.\"", "Both charities claim this is the first case of its kind\n\nA transgender charity's attempt to get an organisation it described as having an \"anti-trans focus\" removed from the charity register has been dismissed.\n\nMermaids launched the legal challenge after the Charity Commission registered the LGB Alliance in 2021.\n\nThe LGB Alliance supports lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but Mermaids alleged the group sought to undermine its charitable activities.\n\nOn Thursday the tribunal ruled Mermaids was not entitled to bring the case.\n\nMermaids' legal challenge is believed to be the first time a charity sought to strip another charity of its charitable status.\n\nBut the tribunal ruled that while Mermaids and its supporters may have been affected by LGB Alliance \"emotionally and/or socially,\" this did not give them the legal right to appeal against their registration as a charity.\n\nMermaids was set up in 1995 to support children and young people questioning their gender identity. It said the LGB Alliance sought to \"destroy\" its reputation and sources of funding.\n\nLGB Alliance says it exists to advance the rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people. It insisted it is not transphobic and does not endorse discriminatory behaviour towards any group or individual.\n\nThe tribunal had been asked to consider whether LGB Alliance should have been registered as a charity, but the two judges on the panel were unable to reach an agreement. Both judges agreed the case should be dismissed.\n\nJudges heard arguments about the definition of homosexuality, transgender rights and gender identity services for children and young people, during a week of evidence at the general regulatory chamber in London, in September.\n\nIn their written ruling, the judges said the case was not about the \"rights of gender diverse people, or about the rights of gay, lesbian and bisexual people\", but focussed on a \"small part\" of the law regulating charities.\n\nThe Charity Commission said its role was not to regulate public debate on sensitive issues but to apply the law when registering charities.\n\nBoth LGB Alliance and Mermaids fundraised thousands of pounds to pay for their legal costs.\n\nKate Barker, chief executive officer of LGB Alliance, said she was \"delighted\" with the decision, but added \"the cost to us and to our supporters has been huge\".\n\nShe said the process had been \"bruising\" for LGB Alliance, that it was glad the process had come to an end and it was looking forward to doing more charitable work.\n\n\"We've got projects like a helpline, friends' groups and student networks and a lot of those things were on hold because we had a cloud hanging over us,\" she said.\n\nMermaids said, although disappointed, the ruling had \"no reflection\" on it as an organisation and its work will continue. It is considering whether to appeal.\n\nJolyon Maugham, the director of campaign group Good Law Project, which supported Mermaids, said he felt the judges took a long time to make a decision because they \"found it impossible\" to rule LGB Alliance's charitable status, due to a \"toxic discourse\" about the rights of trans people.\n\nDuring the case, LGB Alliance said the attempt to have it struck off the register was \"profoundly homophobic\", while Mermaids said LGB Alliance had been persistently \"attacking\" them.\n\nThe Charity Commission urged both charities to be respectful and tolerant of each other. \"Demonising and undermining those who think differently is not acceptable from any charity on our register\", it added.", "Rishi Sunak is to consult his ethics adviser on Monday to discuss Suella Braverman's handling of a speeding offence.\n\nThe home secretary sought advice about arranging a private speed awareness course via officials and an aide, the BBC has been told.\n\nLabour and the Lib Dems have called on the ethics adviser to investigate whether she breached the rules.\n\nMrs Braverman was caught speeding when she was attorney general last summer, and faced three points on her licence and a fine, or a course as part of a group.\n\nShe is under scrutiny, not over the speeding offence itself, but over whether she acted properly in trying to arrange a one-to-one awareness course.\n\nOn Monday the prime minister will talk to Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent official who opposition parties want to examine the claims, after he returns from the G7 summit in Japan.\n\nMr Sunak earlier declined to say whether he would be ordering an inquiry, when asked about the story at the summit.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed her - but a Downing Street source later said that \"of course\" he did.\n\n\"I don't know the full details of what has happened, nor have I spoken to the home secretary,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"But I understand she has expressed regret for speeding, accepted the penalty and paid the fine.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nShadow health secretary Wes Streeting said the prime minister was \"too weak\" to sack her or launch an inquiry.\n\nAnd the Liberal Democrats say Mr Sunak should make a statement in Parliament on Monday to \"explain this farce\".\n\n\"Rishi Sunak is so weak he can't even make sure his own ministers maintain the very basic level of integrity,\" the party's chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said.\n\nAfter being caught speeding, Mrs Braverman was offered the choice of either a fine and points on her driving licence, or a speed awareness course.\n\nA government source told the BBC the senior minister had been \"concerned\" about her insurance premiums, and favoured doing a course.\n\nShe asked civil servants about arranging a course for just her, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group, but was told it was not a matter for the civil service.\n\nMrs Braverman then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a one-on-one course.\n\nWhen the course provider told her there was no option to do a private course - and after she was reappointed home secretary in Mr Sunak's government - she opted to pay the fine and accept the points because she was \"very busy\" and did not have the time to do a course, the BBC has been told.\n\nThe same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.\n\nThe prime minister apparently did not know anything about what happened until the story broke in the Sunday Times.\n\nThis kind of headline, while he is wrangling world leaders abroad, is a headache at home that he certainly does not need.\n\nHaving promised on day one of his job that he would run a government with the highest levels of transparency and integrity, any slight suggestion that his team's behaviour is less than perfect creates political pain for him.\n\nSpeaking to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Conservative cabinet member Therese Coffey said she knew no more about it than what she had read in the papers, while Tory MP Jake Berry said there were \"definitely questions to be answered\".\n\nHe said he expects the issue to be discussed in Parliament in the coming days. Mrs Braverman is already due in the Commons on Monday afternoon for Home Office questions.\n\nThe ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.\n\nAfter serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.\n\nShe resigned on October 19 after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a \"technical infringement of the rules\". But she was reappointed to the same role by Mr Sunak six days later following the collapse of the Truss government.\n\nA source close to the home secretary said: \"Mrs Braverman accepted three points for a speeding offence which took place last summer.\n\n\"The Cabinet Office was made aware of the situation as requested by Mrs Braverman.

Current annual tuition and boarding school fees at Randolph-Macon Academy are $43,873 a year, according to the school's website.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Crow's office did not address the payments made to cover Mr Martin's tuition fees directly, but said the billionaire has \"long been passionate about the importance of quality education and giving back to those less fortunate\".\n\n\"It's disappointing that those with partisan political interests would try to turn helping at-risk youth with tuition assistance into something nefarious or political,\" the statement said.\n\nLast month, ProPublica revealed Justice Thomas enjoyed lavish gifts from Mr Crow, including trips to luxury vacations on private jets, which he did not publicly disclose.\n\nIn a statement addressing those previous reports, Justice Thomas said he had sought \"guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary\" and was told that \"that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable\".\n\nThe justice described Mr Crow and his wife Kathy Crow as \"among our dearest friends, and we have been friends for over twenty-five years\".\n\nIn light of the reports, the Supreme Court has been criticised for a lack of accountability, and Democratic senators have called on the court to investigate Justice Thomas.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers were divided on whether to reform Supreme Court ethics rules at a Senate hearing.\n\nDemocrat Senator Dick Durbin argued that ethical standards for Supreme Court justices are too lax, and that judges and other public officials in lower offices are held to a higher standard.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear to most objective people this is not the ordinary course of business, nor should it be a standard for those of us in public service,\" Mr Durbin said.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican senators accused Democratic lawmakers of targeting the nation's highest court for political reasons. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsay Graham said the latest push for Supreme Court reform was part of \"a concentrated effort by the left to delegitimise the court\".", "Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour would give English councils more powers to build on green belt land to boost housing.\n\nThe Labour leader told the BBC he was prepared to take \"tough decisions\" and \"back the builders, not the blockers\".\n\nHowever, he said construction would only take place where it does not \"affect the beauty of our countryside\".\n\nHe also pledged to restore local housing targets, which are being watered down after calls from Tory MPs.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir gave an example of homes being built on a playing field rather than a car park because the car park was technically within the green belt.\n\n\"We would make those tough choices and say to local areas, notwithstanding that it's greenbelt, if it's a car park or similar land which doesn't affect the beauty of our countryside\u2026 then we'll change the planning rules, we'll give you the powers to do that,\" he said.\n\nUnder current planning rules in England, new buildings can only be constructed on green belt land in exceptional circumstances.\n\nCPRE, the countryside charity, said \"small scale developments of genuinely affordable homes\" were needed by rural communities.\n\nHowever, the charity's director of campaigns and policy Tom Fyans said brownfield should be used first, adding that \"targeting the countryside for a building bonanza of executive homes most people can't afford would be wrong, counterproductive and deeply unpopular\".\n\nIn a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce, Sir Keir argued the current planning system and blocks to building were holding back growth and leaving the economy \"stuck in second gear\".\n\n\"A generation and its hopes, an entire future - blocked by those, who more often than not, enjoy the secure homes and jobs that they're denying to others,\" Sir Keir said.\n\n\"The evidence could not be clearer, there are 38 countries in the OECD, and we are the second worst when it comes to the effectiveness of our planning system.\"\n\nSir Keir said Labour would take a \"new approach to governing\" driven by five clear missions, including the highest sustained growth in the G7.\n\nTaking questions after the speech, the Labour leader accused the government of killing the dream of home ownership by watering down local housing targets.\n\nThe 2019 Conservative manifesto promised to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s.\n\nBut in December, the government said councils would get more flexibility over meeting centrally-set housing need targets.\n\nRecently, Housing Secretary Michael Gove said that the UK's housing model was broken and more homes were \"desperately\" needed.\n\nIn the foreword to a collection of essays on housing published by the Conservative think tank Bright Blue and the housing charity Shelter, he said the need for change was \"undeniable\" and the government was \"determined to build the new homes our country so urgently needs\".\n\n\"That the current housing model - from supply to standards and the mortgage market - is broken, we can all agree,\" he said.\n\nConservative MPs critical of the government's targets had argued they undermined powers of local councils to decide where building takes place.\n\nBut others have raised concerns the changes will lead to fewer homes being built.\n\nSome Labour MPs have also opposed developments in their own areas.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: \"We feel so excited, we feel so happy\"\n\nA group of Ugandan children is on the verge of glory after reaching the final of hit UK talent show Britain's Got Talent, where they have won over the judges and the public with their dazzling dance moves and bubbly personalities.\n\nThey have already made history after becoming the first act to be given a \"golden buzzer\" by one of the judges before they had even finished their performance. This sent them straight through to Wednesday's semi-final, where they received most public votes, meaning they are now among the 10 acts taking part in Sunday's final.\n\nThe group of six children aged between six and 13 all come from impoverished backgrounds in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where they were taken in and cared for by their guardian-turned manager Dauda Kavuma.\n\nHe told the BBC that he hopes their success can encourage other children living in similar circumstances.\n\n\"We feel so happy to keep doing this and to bring hope to all the children around the world who are in the ghetto, who are disadvantaged, who are less privileged - that they can make it in life.\"\n\nWhile they are winning over a new audience in the UK, the Ghetto Kids are already a global internet sensation and performed at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBut one of the group, Priscilla Zawedde, 13, told the BBC that winning the TV show - and the \u00a3250,000 ($313,000) prize money - would mean \"a bigger house for everyone\".\n\nSome 30 children currently share a five-bedroom house in Kampala, where they are looked after by Kavuma.\n\nHe set up the Inspire Ghetto Kids Foundation in 2007 to care for street children in the Kampala neighbourhood of Makindye and told the AFP news agency that having a bigger house would be a \"dream\" as the children would have more space.\n\nThey currently rely on donations from well-wishers, earnings from their social media posts as well as fees for live performances.\n\nKavuma also started life on the street before he was given a chance by a man who spotted him playing football and asked him if he wanted to go to school.\n\n\"He let me join his team and helped me pay my school fees. He was someone who helped me without knowing me. So from that day, I promised myself that when I grow up I'd hope to help a child one day,\" Kavuma told the BBC.\n\nBut he then switched to music, which he is now using to transform the lives of others.\n\n\"Most people thought street kids... have no value in society but I thought otherwise,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I use music, dance and drama to transform the underprivileged in the ghettos?'\" he says.\n\nAkram Muyana, 13, told the BBC that dancing had always been his way of escaping reality after his father died.\n\n\"Whenever I dance, I feel so happy, and my stress goes away. I started going to churches to dance to get money to give my mother for her to buy me clothes and food.\"\n\nThis is the second generation of Kavuma's Ghetto Kids to have found global stardom - the first generation was discovered dancing to Ugandan singer Eddy Kenzo's \"Sitya Loss\" and went on to have millions of YouTube views.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: British nationals board UK military plane to be evacuated from Sudan\n\nThe first flight carrying British nationals escaping conflict-hit Sudan has landed in the UK.\n\nThe flight carrying 250 people from Larnaca Airport in Cyprus arrived at Stansted Airport on Wednesday.\n\nBritish troops are organising the evacuation from the east African country, under cover of a ceasefire which is due to end at midnight on Thursday.\n\nEight flights are expected to leave Khartoum by the end of Wednesday.\n\nThe government has faced some criticism over the speed of the evacuations.\n\nTrapped British nationals have been making their own way to an airstrip near the Sudanese capital Khartoum to get on RAF military flights which take them to Larnaca before their onward journey to the UK.\n\nMore than 300 British national have now boarded four evacuation flights from Sudan, the Foreign Office says. Eight will have left by the end of the day.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman sent reassurances that the government would be supporting British nationals and their dependents in the \"fast moving and complex situation\".\n\nBut she added there were no plans to introduce a legal route for people fleeing Sudan to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nAlicia Kearns, chairwoman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said elderly people dependent on their British citizen children should be allowed on flights to the UK.\n\n\"In the same way we treat children who are dependent on their parents, we should respect that some elderly people are dependent on their children,\" she said.\n\nFlights should include those who would \"otherwise be left destitute and really vulnerable\", she said.\n\nThere has been concern over whether the runway at the Khartoum airstrip will hold up over the next couple of days.\n\nThe BBC has learned from a well-placed source that it is beginning to break up due to the sheer numbers of aircraft taking off and landing.\n\nIf flights are no longer possible, people may then have to take the potential alternative route to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast for a possible seaborne evacuation.\n\nBut government sources said they were aware of the issue with the runway and were confident it would not be a limiting factor in the flights.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Fleeing Sudan - first Britons to leave Cyprus for UK soil\n\nConcerns have been raised about aircraft had been leaving Sudan with empty seats.\n\nBut Brigadier Dan Reeve, the most senior military official overseeing the evacuation, said it was the Foreign Office not the military deciding who was eligible to get on flights.\n\nHe also defended the decision not to escort people to the airport, even though some other countries have done this with their nationals.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said: \"This is not a race to get it wrong. In my professional judgement it would not be safe to bring people together in one location in Khartoum and seek to extract them.\n\n\"We've seen incidents of convoys being attacked.\"\n\nBrig Reeve further explained he thought there had been a \"good rate of flow\" so far, adding the plan was move about 500 people a day on five aircraft.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at Larnaca Airport, passengers said they were delighted to be going home, but reaching the flight had been difficult because of limited UK government help.\n\nOne man said he had to take a bus with his young family and had never been so scared.\n\nYahya Yahya told the BBC it was \"a very difficult time\" and he was \"thankful that we've finally made it to a safe place\".\n\nA British man whose sister managed to be evacuated overnight told the BBC she felt an overwhelming sense of relief to have escaped.\n\nHe said at one point she and 13 others had only four dates and one egg left to share between them because it was not safe for them to go out to look for food.\n\nUK nationals arrived in Cyprus on Wednesday morning on their way back to the UK\n\nAround 120 British troops are supporting the evacuation at the Wadi Saeedna airstrip. Downing Street said the British military would defend the airfield in Sudan but clarified efforts would be made to avoid \"active engagement\" with other forces.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said the \"majority\" of those on board the rescue flights were British nationals, but also included some allies' citizens.\n\n\"We're calling everyone forward and we have no issue with capacity, and people are being processed smoothly,\" he said, adding those travelling to the airport were not having significant issues.\n\nMr Sunak also told the House of Commons on Wednesday the UK \"will continue to work to end the bloodshed in Sudan and support a democratic government\".\"I pay tribute to all those carrying out this complex operation,\" he said.\n\nClashes between the Sudanese army and paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began on 15 April. Hundreds of people have since died and thousands have been injured in the conflict.\n\nAirlifting large numbers of people out of Sudan has been complicated by major airports becoming battlegrounds, and movement out of the capital has been perilous.\n\nYoung children were among the British nationals to arrive at Larnaca International Airport\n\nThe government is also considering a seaborne evacuation from Port Sudan, some 500 miles from the capital. HMS Lancaster and RFA Cardigan Bay have been sent to the region.\n\nOnly British passport holders and immediate family members with existing UK entry clearance are being told they are eligible for the evacuation flights.\n\nAre you a British national who has been evacuated from Sudan?

Little did they know that 50 years later, their arrival would ultimately save a descendant's life.\n\n\"The family came in 1890 to Newry,\" Lill Fanny Saether told BBC News NI.\n\nShe's been piecing together her ancestors' story for decades.\n\n\"They were originally going to America. They were fooled by the captain to think they were in New York but they were in fact in Newry.\n\n\"There was a consular in Newry called Stokes and he helped all the people who came from other countries who couldn't speak English.\n\n\"So he and his family were of great help to my family.\"\n\nLill Fanny Saether visited buildings in Newry where her family lived\n\nLill began tracing her roots in the mid 1990s, when her children bought her a family tree as a birthday present.\n\nThis week she visited Newry to explore some of the buildings that have proved crucial to her very existence.\n\n\"The first address was 30 Mill Street,\" Lill said.\n\nToday, 30 Mill Street is the headquarters of St Vincent de Paul in the city.\n\nBut on 1 August, 1906 it was the setting for the wedding of Joseph Mendle and Flossie Freeman - Lill's grandparents.\n\nA marriage certificate shows that Lill's grandparents were married at Mill Street and a birth certificate shows that Elsie was born in on Kilmorey Terrace\n\nThe resultant marriage certificate states that Joseph was a draper living at 13 Canal Street and Flossie was the daughter of Abraham Freeman - also a draper.\n\nThe document states that 30 Mill Street was her home address at the time of the marriage.\n\nThe couple then moved across town to Kilmorey Terrace - a location Lill visited for the first time this week.\n\n\"My mother was born here in number seven in 1909,\" she said.\n\n\"It's quite moving. She lived there for two years until 1911. Then the family emigrated to Norway.\"\n\nA copy of Elsie's birth record issued in 1929 highlights her date of birth as 18 August 1909 and her residence as 7 Kilmorey Terrace.\n\nElsie (back middle) and her siblings in Norway in 1920\n\nBut it was events some 33 years later around 750 miles away in Oslo that would highlight the importance of documents like this.\n\n\"They were obviously Jewish and like the other Jewish families were victims of the Nazis occupation and persecution.\n\n\"In October and November 1942 they arrested first the men and then all the women and children.\n\n\"But because my mother was born here [in the United Kingdom] and had kept her British citizenship she saved her life.\n\n\"There were certain nationalities that were exempt and that was those that weren't occupied, that were neutral and those that were allies with Germany.\"\n\nElsie's brother and sister were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp\n\nWhen the Nazis came to the family's apartment they took Elsie's sister, who was born in Norway. Their brother, who was also born in Norway, had already been arrested.\n\nThey were sent to Auschwitz during the Holocaust, \"so they perished\", said Lill.\n\nShe added: \"But my mother and her mother and my grandfather and the sister that was born here, they were able to escape to Sweden in the middle of December 1942.\n\n\"The fact that she was born here...that means I'm alive, and my daughters and my grandchildren.\"", "Sanna Marin was pleased with her party's performance but it was Petteri Orpo's night\n\n\"We got the biggest mandate,\" said the leader of the National Coalition Party, after a dramatic night in which the result gradually swung away from Ms Marin's Social Democrats.\n\nMr Orpo secured 20.8% of the vote, ahead of the right-wing populist Finns Party and the centre left.\n\nIt is a bitter defeat for Ms Marin, who increased her party's seats and secured 19.9% of the vote.\n\nShe continues to enjoy high poll ratings and has been widely praised for steering Finland towards imminent entry into Nato and navigating her country through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShortly after the conservative leader claimed victory, the centre-left leader conceded the election.\n\n\"Congratulations to the winner of the elections, congratulations to the National Coalition Party, congratulations to the Finns Party. Democracy has spoken,\" she told supporters.\n\nFor weeks the three parties had been almost level in the polls, and as the results came in it became too close to call.

They want change and now I will start negotiations, open negotiations with all parties,\" he said.\n\nThere was a mood of euphoria in the camp, said Matti Koivisto, political correspondent with public broadcaster YLE. \"When they saw the projection, it was quite clear they were going to win.\"\n\nFinns Party leader Riikka Purra congratulated her centre-right rival and was herself delighted with the best result in her party's history.\n\n\"We're still challenging to be number one, but seven more seats is an excellent result.\"\n\nThe Finns underlined their success by winning more regions than any other party in mainland Finland. Riikka Purra won more votes than any other candidate and commentators highlighted her party's appeal to young voters by reaching out over social media such as TikTok.\n\nMeanwhile, three of the other parties in the outgoing coalition - the Centre Party, Left Alliance and Greens - all rang up big losses.\n\nNow 37, Sanna Marin became the world's youngest leader when she burst on to the political scene in 2019. She headed a coalition of five parties, all led by women.\n\nDespite her successful response to neighbouring Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the election was largely fought on Finland's economy and public debt as all the mainstream parties backed Nato membership. Finland officially becomes Nato's 31st member on Tuesday.\n\nMany Finns see Ms Marin as a polarising figure. She came under heavy scrutiny last year when a video emerged of her singing, dancing and drinking at a party. Supporters said the controversy was steeped in sexism and women across Finland and the world shared videos of themselves dancing in solidarity.\n\nPetteri Orpo by contrast has none of Sanna Marin's \"rock-star\" qualities, says YLE's Matti Koivisto.\n\n\"He's a career politician. He's been in the game since the 1990s and he's quite stable and calm. There is criticism that maybe he's too dull and calm, but it also works quite well in Finland.\"\n\nThe conservatives will have the first opportunity in forming a government, and if they succeed, Mr Orpo, 53, will become the next prime minister.\n\nUnder an Orpo-led government, Europe could expect a pro-European conservative from the liberal centre of his party with an emphasis on economic policy.\n\nLess exciting than Sanna Marin and very moderate, says Vesa Vares, professor of contemporary history at the University of Turku: \"A sort of dream son-in-law.\"\n\nUnder Finland's system of proportional representation he will have to muster more than 100 seats in the 200-seat parliament to run the country, and that will not be straightforward.\n\nMr Orpo really has two choices ahead of him, either forming a right-wing coalition with Riikka Purra's nationalist Finns Party or reaching an agreement with Sanna Marin's Social Democrats.\n\n\"The Finns are a very difficult partner because they're so inexperienced and they have MPs who are discontented towards almost anything,\" says Prof Vares.\n\n\"The most natural thing would be to co-operate with the Social Democrats. But [Sanna Marin] used to belong to her party's left wing and it's obvious she doesn't like the conservatives.\"\n\nPolitics researcher Jenni Karimaki of the University of Helsinki also points out that Ms Marin has been reluctant to say what her aspirations are.\n\nThe Social Democrats have mixed feelings, she says, because while they increased their seats in parliament, they were unable to become the biggest party and renew their premiership.\n\n\"But Finnish political culture is known for its flexibility.

The government said it had acted on the BMA's request for pension reform, increasing the tax-free threshold on pensions contributions.\n\nUnlike junior doctors at the start of their dispute, consultants are not asking for full pay restoration in one go. Instead, they want the government to start at least giving pay rises that match inflation.\n\nDuring 2022, average NHS earnings exceeded \u00a3126,000 for consultants - this includes extra pay for additional hours and performance.\n\nDr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA consultants committee, said the strikes were a last resort and that the union had \"been left with no choice\".\n\nHe said the government was \"devaluing consultants' expertise\" and showing a \"lack of regard for the impact this is having on the NHS\".\n\nHe said the pay body recommendation of a 6% pay rise showed \"the need to reform the pay review system\" and that the increase was a \"savage real-terms pay cut\".\n\nDr Sharma warned of further strikes after August, saying consultants were \"in this for the long haul\". More than 85% of BMA members backed walkouts in a previous ballot.\n\n\"The future of the NHS depends on there being consultants within it, but attacks on their pay will drive them away - from the health service and from the country - with devastating consequences,\" he said.\n\nAre you a consultant with a view on the strike?

Many jeered the prime minister, sang La Marseillaise and held up signs of protest in parliament.\n\nA no-confidence motion was filed against President Emmanuel Macron's government on Friday by a group of opposition parties.\n\nLeader of left-wing party La France Insoumise (LFI), Mathilde Panot, tweeted that Mr Macron had plunged the country into a government crisis, without parliamentary or popular legitimacy.\n\nThousands of people came out on the streets of Paris and other French cities to reject the move, singing the national anthem and waving trade union flags.\n\nSome protesters clashed with police as evening fell. A fire was lit in the middle of the Place de la Concorde and police with shields and batons fired tear gas and moved to clear the square.\n\nBy nightfall, 120 people had been arrested, Paris police told AFP news agency.\n\nBut unions vowed to maintain their opposition to the pension changes, with the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) saying another day of strikes and demonstrations was being planned for Thursday 23 March.\n\nThe constitutional procedure that has prompted all this anger may sound obscure, but it is very much part of the political vocabulary in France.\n\nEven though Mr Macron was re-elected last year on a platform of retirement reforms, his ruling coalition has no majority in the Assembly and would have needed support from the Republicans party to pass the pension changes.\n\nOfficials from Mr Macron's Renaissance party spent the morning desperately whipping members into line in a bid to pass their bill.\n\nThey knew some of their MPs could vote against or abstain, faced with the evident unpopularity of the bill, so they resorted to special constitutional powers.\n\nBut whenever a government invokes the 49:3, it can be sure it will be accused straight away of riding roughshod over the will of the people.\n\nIn fact, it has been used precisely 100 times in the more than 60 years of the Fifth Republic, and by governments of all shades.\n\nObviously, it tends to be used more frequently by governments that do not have an in-built majority in parliament, such as the socialist Michel Rocard's in the 1980s and \u00c9lisabeth Borne's today.\n\nShe has in fact already used it several times, but those occasions were for public finance bills which were less controversial.\n\nUse of the procedure is a way to bypass a vote which might be lost, but the down side for the government is that the opposition parties can immediately table a vote of no-confidence.\n\nIf these are voted through, the government falls. That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.\n\nThe dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.\n\nBut the bill is regularly described by opponents as \"brutal\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\".\n\nMorale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab will stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nHis decision, first reported in The Telegraph, comes a month after he resigned as a minister when a bullying inquiry found he had acted in an \"intimidating\" way towards officials.\n\nThe paper quotes Mr Raab as saying he is concerned about \"the pressure the job has placed on my young family\".\n\nMr Raab and his wife have two sons, aged 10 and eight.\n\nSince becoming an MP in 2010, Mr Raab has served in many ministerial roles.\n\nIn 2018 then-prime minister Theresa May appointed him as Brexit secretary, a job he quit less than six months laterover Theresa May's draft Brexit deal.\n\nBoris Johnson picked him to be his foreign secretary and first secretary of state - the latter role meant he was left in charge of running the country when Mr Johnson was hospitalised with Covid in April 2020.\n\nMr Raab has also been a close ally of Rishi Sunak, supporting him in last summer's Conservative leadership race.\n\nMr Sunak rewarded his loyalty when he became prime minister, making Mr Raab both his justice secretary and deputy prime minister.\n\nMr Raab confirmed to BBC News that he would not seek re-election as the MP for Esher and Walton, which he has represented since 2010 and won with a majority of 2,743 votes in 2019.\n\nIn a letter from Mr Raab to his constituency, seen by the Telegraph, the MP said it had been a \"huge honour to represent the Conservatives since 2010 in this wonderful constituency\".\n\nHis departure from Parliament means the Conservatives will have to find a new candidate for the Surrey constituency.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, who are targeting his seat at the next election, called on him to \"do the decent and honest thing\" and stand down immediately, triggering a by-election to replace him.\n\n\"People in Esher and Walton deserve better than to have a MP found guilty of bullying, who has now thrown in the towel,\" said the party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper.\n\nMr Raab joins a growing number of senior Conservatives deciding not to stand in the next general election, expected in 2024.\n\nFormer ministers including Sajid Javid and George Eustice have also announced their intention to leave the House of Commons.\n\nIn all, 53 MPs from different parties have said they would stand down at the next election.\n\nMr Raab was at the centre of months of speculation when bullying allegations from civil servants led to an inquiry into the MP's conduct.\n\nThe report - conducted by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC - concluded Mr Raab had engaged in an \"abuse or misuse of power\" as foreign secretary.\n\nThe findings prompted Mr Raab to step down, but in his resignation letter he noted that the inquiry \"dismissed all but two of the claims levelled against me\".\n\nHe also said the inquiry was \"flawed and sets a dangerous precedent\" and would \"encourage spurious complaints against ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people\".\n\nResponding to his decision to quit as an MP, fellow Conservative Angela Richardson tweeted: \"His constituents will miss his dedication. I am happy for his young family though. This job is tough enough on family life as a simple backbencher, let alone being in Cabinet.\"", "Kevin Spacey spent around three hours in the witness box today, his evidence tested by the prosecutor.\n\nThe actor projected his voice at times when denying the allegations and told the court he \u201cdefinitely\u201d misread the signs from one of the four male complainants - but had consensual agreements with two others.\n\nSpacey, an Oscar winner, also denied drugging and performing a sex act on one of the complainants while he was asleep. Spacey said one of the allegations, that he grabbed a man\u2019s crotch, was completely untrue.\n\nThe prosecutor suggested he had used his position of power and fame. The actor said he didn\u2019t have a \u201cpower wand\u201d that he waved in front of people\u2019s faces whenever he wanted someone to go to bed with him.\n\nHe also admitted feeling \u201clonely\u201d after becoming famous. Asked if he reached out to people sexually in order to ease the burden, he replied: \u201cWelcome to life. Yes, yes I did\u201d.\n\nSpacey denies the charges and the trial continues.", "Huw Edwards has been named as the BBC presenter at the centre of days of allegations and speculation.\n\nThe Sun newspaper first reported that the presenter, who was not named, was alleged to have paid a young person for sexually explicit photos. Other people have since alleged inappropriate contact.\n\nHere is a timeline of events:\n\nThe parents of the young person contacted South Wales Police. The force said the information related to \"the welfare of an adult\", and that \"no criminality was identified\".\n\nA family member went to a BBC building to make a complaint about the behaviour of a BBC presenter, according to the corporation.\n\nThe family member made a 29-minute call to the BBC's audience services team, which then referred it to the BBC's corporate investigations team.\n\nThey decided the complaint didn't include an allegation of criminality, but did merit further investigation. It \"was very serious\", according to director general Tim Davie.\n\nThe investigations unit said they emailed the complainant to ask for more information so they could verify the claims, and carried out checks to verify the identity of the complainant.\n\nThe corporate investigations team had received no reply to the email so tried to call the mobile number provided by the complainant. They said the call didn't connect.\n\nHowever, the Sun later reported that \"the family say no-one from the corporation rang them for a proper interview after the initial complaint\".\n\nThe BBC said no additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after this date, but the case \"remained open\".\n\nThe Sun newspaper told the BBC via the corporate press office about allegations concerning Edwards. According to the BBC, the claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, which were different from those received by the investigations team.\n\nThe BBC said this was the first time Mr Davie or any executive directors were made aware of the case. They set up an incident management group to lead the response.\n\nA senior manager spoke to the presenter about the allegations, and Edwards first learned of the allegations on this day, his wife said. The BBC said it was agreed that he shouldn't appear on air while the allegations were being investigated.\n\nWhen later asked why the presenter was not spoken to sooner, Mr Davie said: \"You don't take that complaint directly to the presenter unless it has been verified.\"\n\nThe Sun's first story was published, about the mother's claims that an unnamed BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos over three years, beginning when they were 17. That raised questions about whether the behaviour was illegal.\n\nThe paper quoted the mother as saying the young person used the money to fund a crack cocaine habit, and that she was worried her child could \"wind up dead\".\n\nThe young person sent a WhatsApp message to the paper on this evening denying the claims, saying their mother's statement was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\", according to a later letter from their lawyer.\n\nIn its first public statement, the BBC said any information would \"be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes\".\n\nThe BBC also made contact with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe Sun published further allegations, quoting the mother as saying the presenter was pictured in his underwear \"ready for my child to perform for him\".\n\nThe BBC said it received some materials from the family member regarding the complaint on this and the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, following speculation about the star's identity on social media, BBC presenters including Gary Lineker, Jeremy Vine, Rylan Clark and Nicky Campbell denied involvement to publicly clear their names.\n\nThe BBC said it had suspended a male staff member and was \"working as quickly as possible to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps\".\n\nThe Sun reported that the presenter allegedly made two calls to the young person and asked them \"what have you done\", and appealed to them to call their mother to \"stop the investigation\".\n\nRepresentatives from the BBC met detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, but there was \"no investigation at this time\".\n\nIn a letter to the BBC, the lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the original allegations disputed their mother's account of events, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".\n\nThe letter claimed the young person sent the newspaper a denial on Friday, but that it proceeded to publish \"their inappropriate article\".\n\nIn response, the Sun said it had \"reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child\".\n\nTheir complaint \"was not acted upon by the BBC\" and it had \"seen evidence that supports their concerns\", the Sun added. \"It's now for the BBC to properly investigate.\"\n\nThe parents told the Sun they stood by their account. The step-father was quoted as saying the allegations were originally put to the BBC \"for an hour\".\n\nDuring a press conference to launch the BBC's annual report and an interview with Radio 4, Mr Davie gave more details of the corporation's response.\n\nThe director general said he wanted to examine whether the BBC raises \"red flags quick enough\" when such complaints are made.\n\nThe BBC accepted there were \"lessons to be learned following this exercise\", and the organisation's group chief operating officer will assess whether protocols and procedures are appropriate.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, another young person told BBC News they had felt threatened by the presenter.\n\nThe individual in their early 20s said they were contacted on a dating app and pressured to meet up, but never did. When the young person hinted online that they might name the presenter, they were sent abusive messages.\n\nJeremy Vine said the presenter \"should now come forward publicly\" because the new allegations \"will result in yet more vitriol being thrown at perfectly innocent colleagues\" and the BBC \"is on its knees with this\".\n\nThe Sun alleged that the presenter broke Covid lockdown rules to meet a 23-year-old, who he had met on a dating site.\n\nThe paper also published what it said was an Instagram chat between the presenter and a 17-year-old, in which the presenter sent messages including love heart emojis.\n\nDetectives ended their assessment of the details and decided there was no information to indicate that a criminal offence had been committed.\n\nEdwards' wife Vicky Flind named him as the BBC presenter at the centre of the allegations.\n\nShe said she was doing so \"primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children\".\n\nEdwards was \"suffering from serious mental health issues\", she said. \"As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.\n\n\"To be clear, Huw was first told that there were allegations being made against him last Thursday.\"\n\nMr Davie sent an email to staff saying an internal investigation would continue now police were no longer involved.\n\nThe Sun said it had no plans to publish further allegations, and would \"provide the BBC team with a confidential and redacted dossier containing serious and wide-ranging allegations which we have received, including some from BBC personnel\".\n\nThe BBC reported fresh allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Edwards towards junior staff. Two current workers and one former member of staff claimed they were sent messages that made them uncomfortable.", "President Putin carrying a photograph of his father during last year's Victory Day celebrations\n\nSeveral Russian cities have announced they will scale back this year's Victory Day celebrations.\n\nRussian authorities have cited security reasons and attacks from pro-Ukrainian forces for the changes.\n\nExplosions and fires have occurred in Russia in recent weeks.\n\nBut some have argued that the reduced events show the Kremlin is nervous about celebrations turning into shows of dissent against its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGreat pomp and shows of military might are the usual hallmarks of Victory Day, which marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany on 9 May 1945.\n\nOne of the day's most recognisable events is the Immortal Regiment procession, which sees people across the country marching holding photographs of their relatives who fought in World War Two.\n\nLast year, President Vladimir Putin led the procession across Red Square in Moscow while holding a photograph of his father in uniform.\n\nThis year, however, the Immortal Regiment \"will be held in other formats for security reasons\", lawmaker and organiser Yelena Tsunayeva told journalists last month.\n\nAccording to a news release on the Immortal Regiment of Russia's website, Ms Tsunayeva suggested that those wishing to commemorate their relatives should instead place photos of war veterans in car windows, transfer their image to items of clothing, or change their social media avatars.\n\nSome commentators have said that an in-person Immortal Regiment procession could end up highlighting the number of Russian losses in Ukraine.\n\nDmitry Kolezev, a journalist and editor of a liberal news website, now living in exile, said that had the procession not been cancelled, people would have \"almost certainly come to the Immortal Regiment with portraits of those who died in Ukraine, and the number of recent photographs may turn out to be depressingly large\".\n\nMr Kolezev also said that the authorities might be concerned that a large gathering of people could snowball into a show of dissent. \"History knows of examples when loyal events turned into protests,\" he said on Telegram.\n\nViktor Muchnik, the former editor-in-chief of a Siberian TV network, who has also left the country, said the Russian state was \"maniacally suspicious\" and was less concerned about a \"hypothetical terrorist attack\" than it was about damage to its image.\n\nHe said that the Kremlin might fear that the procession will show \"too many portraits of those who died not 80 years ago, but over the past year\".\n\n\"This will give an idea of the hidden extent of the disaster,\" Mr Muchnik said in an interview.\n\nMeanwhile, the world-famous parade of military equipment on Moscow's Red Square, which is traditionally observed by President Putin, will be strictly closed off to the public.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia's security services were working to ensure the safety of the parade against \"terrorist attacks\".\n\n\"We are of course aware that the Kyiv regime, which is behind a number of such attacks, terrorist acts, plans to continue its campaign. All our special services are doing everything possible to ensure security,\" he said.\n\nTwo separate fires at fuel storage facilities have broken out in the last few days in southern Russia and in Russian-occupied Crimea, including one on Wednesday morning in the Krasnodar region near a bridge leading to the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThis week, two separate explosions in the Russian border region of Bryansk derailed freight trains, while power lines were destroyed by a suspected explosive device in Leningrad Region.\n\nAlthough none of these attacks have been claimed by Ukraine, Kyiv's military has said that undermining Russia's logistics formed part of preparations for its long-expected counter-offensive.", "A poster for a West End play featuring a wedding cake was banned by Transport for London (TfL) because it was seen to promote \"foods high in fat, salt and sugar\".\n\nThe ad for Tony n' Tina's Wedding, a dinner show at Wonderville, Haymarket, featured a three-tier sponge cake.\n\nThe team spent \u00a320,000 on the posters to go on London's transport network.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \"We are always happy to work with brands to help them follow our advertising policy.\"\n\nThe interactive show is set at an Italian-American wedding, with a three-course meal, live music and dancing.\n\nProducer Paul Gregg told BBC London they could not run the posters after they delivered them to TfL.\n\nThe revised poster, right, depicted wedding guests instead\n\n\"They said 'you can't put these up, they've got cake on',\" he said. \"It was a bit of a surprise... the poster was designed at great expense to begin with.\"\n\nHis team spent a week creating the new design, costing an additional \u00a35,000.\n\nTfL said it refused to run 20 adverts displaying foods and non alcoholic drinks that were high in fat, sugar or salt, in the year 2021/22.\n\nA TfL spokesperson added: \"We welcome all advertising on our network that complies with our published guidance.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Bangladesh's disaster official Kamrul Hasan said the cyclone caused \"no major damage\", but landslides and floods are still hitting the country. No casualties have been reported in Bangladesh so far.\n\nMyanmar appears to have borne more direct impact, with the storm crashing through houses and cutting power lines in Rakhine state. Myanmar's meteorological department said it pounded through the country at about 209km/h (130 mph).\n\nCamps for displaced Rohingya in the state have also been ripped apart.\n\nLocal media reported that a 14-year-old boy were among those reported dead - he was killed by a falling tree in the state.\n\nElectricity and wireless connections were disrupted across much of Sittwe. Footage online showed roofs being blown off houses, telecom towers brought down, and billboards flying off buildings amid teeming rain across the region.\n\nAuthorities have declared Rakhine state a natural disaster area, while the Myanmar Red Cross Society said it was \"preparing for a major emergency response\".\n\nMyanmar appears to have borne more direct impact from the cyclone\n\nVillagers in Myanmar flee their homes as the storm approaches\n\nAuthorities in Bangladesh had evacuated 750,000 people ahead of the storm.\n\nThe streets of Cox's Bazar emptied as the cyclone intensified - the skies darkened, the winds picked up pace and the rains pounded down.\n\nHundreds of people crammed into a school which had been turned into a temporary cyclone shelter.\n\nMothers with babies, young children, the elderly and the frail packed into any available space in the classrooms, sleeping on desks and sitting under them.\n\nAs many arrived at the shelter in rickshaws and on foot, they brought their livestock - cattle, chickens, goats - as well as mats to sleep on.\n\nThey had come from fishing and coastal villages up to two hours away, making a difficult choice.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave my house,\" said Sumi Akter, who lives on a riverbank.\n\nSumi and others we met here say they have lived through other cyclones in recent years and are resigned to the regular pattern of leaving their homes to the mercy of nature.\n\nStorm surges of up to four metres could swamp villages in low-lying areas. Sumi and others here are fearful their homes may be submerged.\n\n\"I wish the homes we lived in were built more strongly,\" she said.\n\nJannat, aged 17, whom we had met the day before in the same shelter, said she too was terrified of what might happen to her home on the riverbank.\n\nLast year, another cyclone, Sitrang, destroyed her house, forcing her to spend what little money she had on repairing it.\n\n\"How can I live if this keeps happening? I can't afford to rebuild it - we are very poor,\" she said.\n\nNature was also punishing the poor in the world's largest refugee camp nearby.\n\nBangladesh's government does not allow Rohingya refugees to leave the camps, nor to build permanent structures.\n\nAs the cyclone hit, they hunkered down in flimsy bamboo shelters with tarpaulin roofs. Some were moved to community shelters within the camps, which offered little more protection.\n\nAuthorities told the BBC that more than 1,300 shelters were damaged by the wind, as were 16 mosques and learning centres. Trees had fallen in the camps, while two landslides also caused some damage.\n\nThe tarpaulin that covered Mohammed Ayub's shelter was torn off by the winds. Now he and his family of eight are living in the open, in wet and miserable weather.\n\nHaving spent the days before terrified of what Cyclone Mocha could bring, Mohammed was relieved the camps didn't take a direct hit from the storm.\n\nMizanur Rahman, from the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, said that as far as he was aware, there were no casualties in the camps as a result of the cyclone.\n\nFamilies with young children are crammed into makeshift cyclone refuges\n\nEvacuees at one cyclone shelter told the BBC they were worried about the lack of food\n\nForecasters warned Cyclone Mocha could be the most powerful storm seen in Bangladesh in nearly two decades.\n\nThe Bangladeshi meteorological department office said the maximum sustained wind speed within 75km (45 miles) of the centre of the cyclone was about 195km/h (120mph), with gusts and squalls of 215km/h.\n\nIn preparation for the storm's arrival, nearby airports had been shut, fishermen were ordered to suspend their work and 1,500 shelters set up as people from vulnerable areas were moved to safer spots.\n\nIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis tore through the southern coastal regions of Myanmar, killing almost 140,000 people and severely affecting millions.

The harm done by that one word is absolutely immeasurable\".\n\nOfsted inspected the school again in June in line with government guidelines to monitor schools that need to improve - and not as a result of Ms Perry's death.\n\nIn their latest report, seen by the BBC, the watchdog said: \"The school's work to address previous weaknesses has been swift, thorough and effective.\"\n\nThe primary school was initially inspected in November 2022 and subsequently rated inadequate after concerns were raised over leadership and management.\n\nMs Perry's family said the inspection process caused her significant distress.\n\nFor Caversham Primary school this is a bittersweet moment for staff and parents.\n\nIt's just six months since Ruth Perry's suicide left a gaping hole in the school community.\n\nFor her colleagues this is recognition of everything they have done.\n\nFor her family it raises again the question of whether the stakes of Ofsted inspection have been far too high for headteachers.\n\nMPs are to hold an inquiry in the autumn looking at how the inspection system is working. It won't consider the circumstances around Ruth Perry's death, which will be examined by a coroner.\n\nThe new report said useful advice was sought from beyond the school straight after the last inspection.\n\n\"In particular, this helped leaders to understand fully the extent of the weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements and prioritise what needed to be done,\" the report said.\n\nIn a statement, the head teacher's sister Ms Waters said staff at the school who had worked with or been trained by Ms Perry had never been anything other than \"excellent, caring and professional\".\n\nShe added: \"The reversal of the previous judgement in a matter of a few months illustrates why schools should be given the opportunity to correct any technical weaknesses before the final report is published.\n\n\"An inspection should be about helping schools with independent scrutiny, not catching them out and publicly shaming them.\"\n\n\"That Ruth was left feeling suicidal as a result of Ofsted's previous judgement demonstrates, in the most tragic way possible, the intolerably high stakes created by the current inspection system,\" she added.\n\nAn inquest later this year will fully investigate Ms Perry's death, which also prompted a wider debate about whether one-word grades for schools make sense.\n\nIn their latest report Ofsted said the arrangements for safeguarding at Caversham Primary School were effective.\n\n\"A positive culture of safeguarding now pervades the school,\" it added.\n\nLast month, Ofsted announced changes to its inspection system.\n\nThese included allowing schools that were given an inadequate rating over safeguarding to be re-inspected within three months, giving them a chance to be re-graded if they have addressed concerns.\n\nOfsted previously said it always strived to make inspections \"as positive an experience for school staff as they can be\".\n\nMPs have now launched an inquiry into Ofsted's school inspections, looking at how useful they are to parents, governors and schools in England.\n\nAmanda Spielman, the watchdog's chief inspector, previously told the BBC the \"whole school accountability system\" was built around the one-word judgements.\n\nShe acknowledged there were issues around accountability at schools but said scrapping one-word judgements \"wouldn't really solve the underlying discomfort\".\n\nThe Department for Education has also defended one-word inspections.\n\nIt said they \"succinctly summarise independent evaluations on the quality of education, safeguarding, and leadership which parents greatly rely on to give them confidence in choosing the right school for their child\".\n\nIt said the government used them to \"highlight success, identify schools that need support and to trigger intervention where necessary.\"\n\nWatch the story of head teacher, Ruth Perry, who took her life after her school's rating was downgraded by Ofsted.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

She says he then persistently pursued a sexual relationship with her in WhatsApp messages seen by the BBC.\n\n\"I'd love to spend a night with you, in a real bedroom, hotel, whatever,\" read one message from the officer.\n\nOne of the messages sent to Charlotte by Whitehurst\n\nAfter a relationship which lasted a number of months, Charlotte complained to the force in September 2020 about his conduct.\n\nThe officer then began visiting her home without invitation, despite Charlotte making further complaints to the force and sending him messages asking to be left alone.\n\nOne visit was recorded on a doorbell camera. Det Sgt Whitehurst is seen standing outside Charlotte's home at 22:45 in the evening, repeatedly pressing her doorbell.\n\nCharlotte says she rang Warwickshire Police while hiding under the duvet of her bed but officers took 45 minutes to arrive at her home, and they didn't take a statement.\n\n\"There was no urgency,\" she says, despite having been told there were \"red flags\" placed on her address after previous visits.\n\nDoorbell camera footage of Det Sgt Whitehurst outside Charlotte Smith's house (lines in foreground are a spider's web)\n\nWhitehurst - who is 20 years older than Charlotte - was suspended last year. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) recommended 18 months ago that he face a gross misconduct hearing, but this is yet to happen.\n\nCharlotte says persistent harassment over two and a half years - despite her numerous complaints - has left her feeling powerless.\n\n\"He works in the anti-corruption and professional standards department [PSD], that's the place you complain to - so what hope have you got?\" she says.\n\nIn a phone call with the BBC, Whitehurst denied abusing his position for a sexual purpose and said he did not regard Charlotte as vulnerable when he met her again.\n\nHe said the WhatsApp messages seen by the BBC were not \"familiar\" to him and the visit to Charlotte's home was made out of concern for her.\n\nWarwickshire Police says the allegations are \"extremely serious\" but it cannot state what steps it has taken to protect Charlotte, because of ongoing investigations. These, it says, have to be completed before a gross misconduct hearing.\n\nAll forces have their own internal professional standards teams which carry out investigations into officer misconduct - although cases can sometimes be conducted by the IOPC.\n\nBut BBC News has learned of crucial evidence being deleted relating to officers under investigation by their PSD.\n\nOne woman - a victim of child sexual abuse with complex mental health problems - told Bedfordshire Police officers that she had been raped by an inspector.\n\nHer claims were recorded on police body-worn video during two separate visits to her home.\n\nThe BBC has learned that footage of both visits was later deleted. On one of these occasions, the inspector accused by the woman was in charge of the control room which handles callouts.\n\nDame Vera Baird: \"There couldn't be a bigger breach of confidence and faith\"\n\nThe officer has always denied the rape allegation. He initially said his relationship with the woman was platonic before later admitting they had sex. Investigators found that his police radio GPS linked him to her home. An allegation that the inspector had previously sent racist messages was also uncovered as part of the investigation.\n\nBedfordshire Police says the deletion of the footage was an \"administrative error\" and that interviews with the woman took place in response - however, one expert says that these would have different value as evidence.\n\nThe force has paid a substantial settlement to the woman without making any admissions or apologising to her. The inspector was investigated for misconduct but faced no sanction and continues to work for the force.\n\nThe BBC has also been told that the Metropolitan Police \"botched\" an investigation into a detective inspector accused of having sex with multiple victims of rape.\n\nFour women reported that the lead officer in a rape investigation team had had sex with them. All had previously reported being victims of rape or sexual assault.\n\nTwo former members of the Met's professional standards team say that forensic best practice was not followed, and the officer's phone was wiped by someone remotely after his arrest.\n\nSince then, the detective inspector has been dismissed from the force on other charges.\n\nNew Scotland Yard in central London - the Metropolitan Police's HQ\n\nThe Metropolitan Police declined to respond to the claims but said it had \"matters to finalise\" in relation to the officer - a number of years after first suspending him. It also declined to say whether it had re-investigated all rape cases he had dealt with. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was not enough evidence to charge him.\n\nThe BBC has received responses to information requests from 32 police forces in England, Wales and Scotland about allegations of \"abuse of position for a sexual purpose\".\n\nThe claims cover the past five years, although some forces were only able to provide figures from 2020 - when the complaint category was simplified.\n\nWe found out that 536 allegations have been made - but just 24 officers have been handed a criminal charge.\n\nThe figures also show that individual officers have faced as many as 20 allegations - while one who faced nine was only given a final written warning. Forces were also far less likely to uphold complaints than the IOPC.\n\nWomen are being \"preyed upon by officers [who] they've called on to help them at a time of distress\", according to Dame Vera Baird, the former victims' commissioner and former solicitor general.\n\nShe says change has to be immediate - and neighbourhood forces should be asked to investigate all complaints of officer sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Complaints should be going out to another force and not being done internally,\" she says. \"Who is policing the police professional standard departments?\"\n\nBaroness Casey led a review into the Met which found it to be institutionally misogynist\n\nThe IOPC says it has oversight of the police complaints system but that the responsibility lies with forces themselves to root out any abuse of position it describes as \"serious corruption\".\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council says the BBC's findings reinforce the work it is doing \"to lift the stones and root out wrongdoers\". Forces are intent on delivering \"long term improvements to standards and culture\", according to Chief Constable Craig Guildford.\n\nBaroness Casey led a review into the Met which found it to be institutionally misogynist. She does not accept that enough is being done.\n\n\"It's jaw-droppingly appalling that you have cases of really serious sexual allegations made against police officers that simply go on for years,\" she says.\n\n\"[Officers] think they're untouchable and frankly, they are. That's what's so terrifying.\"\n\nIn a statement, the crime and policing minister, Chris Philp MP, said a \"zero tolerance approach\" to officer abuse was needed.\n\nHe said the Home Office was acting to ensure \"predatory individuals\" were prevented from joining in the first place and reviewing the current police dismissals process.\n\nMr Philp added that a recent review into police vetting by a watchdog had recognised progress was being made and forces are pro-actively checking serving officers.\n\nIn November 2022, a previous report by the same body - His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services - also found that \"in too many places, a culture of misogyny, sexism and predatory behaviour towards members of the public and female police officers and staff still exists.\"\n\nHave you had an experience of police misconduct?

The spokesman also said he was not involved in the arrangement of a loan between them.\n\nBut a cross-party committee said in February that he had not given them the \"full facts\" two years ago when they were considering his suitability for the BBC role.\n\nThe BBC is also conducting its own internal review over any potential conflicts of interest Mr Sharp may have in his current role as BBC chairman.\n\nMr Sharp was named as the government's preferred candidate for the BBC chairmanship in January 2021 and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) committee backed his appointment.\n\nThe government's choice is ultimately decided by the prime minister, on the advice of the culture secretary, who is in turn advised by a panel.\n\nMr Sharp was asked to appear before the committee in February following the claims around a loan to Mr Johnson, which were first reported by the Sunday Times.\n\nHe told the committee that he had met Cabinet Secretary Simon Case in December 2020 to get permission to pass on Mr Blyth's details.\n\nHowever, at the same meeting he told Mr Case that he had applied for the BBC job and therefore agreed he would have \"no further participation\" in order to avoid any conflict of interest or perception of conflict given his application.\n\nIn its highly critical report, the DCMS committee said Mr Sharp had recognised the need to be \"open and transparent\" by bringing it to the attention of the cabinet secretary, but \"failed to apply the same standards of openness and candour in his decision not to divulge this information during the interview process or to this committee during the pre-appointment hearing [for the BBC job]\".\n\n\"Mr Sharp's failure to disclose his actions to the panel and the committee, although he believed this to be completely proper, constitute a breach of the standards expected of individuals applying for such public appointments,\" the report added.\n\nThe report concluded: \"Mr Sharp should consider the impact his omissions will have on trust in him, the BBC and the public appointments process.\"", "For almost a year, Beyonc\u00e9's fans have been starved of visuals for her seventh album, Renaissance.\n\nIt's an unusual move for a star whose visual aesthetic has always been intertwined with her music.\n\nFrom the bubblegum-popping, star-making video for Crazy In Love, to the multi-layered exploration of infidelity and black femininity in the visual album, Lemonade, she has always used fashion and iconography to enhance her songs.\n\nSo all eyes are on her new world tour. How will she depict Renaissance's adventurous exploration of marginalised black and queer club music on the stage?\n\nThe stakes are as high as the anticipation. This is Beyonc\u00e9's first solo tour in seven years, and her first concerts since her historic, politically-charged headline set at the 2018 Coachella festival.\n\nSo as the lights dim and giant, stadium-width video screens are filled with sky-blue imagery, there's an equal sense of excitement and expectation from an audience that includes Dua Lipa, Frank Ocean, Kris Jenner and Beyonc\u00e9's husband, Jay-Z.\n\nWhat she unveils is an intergalactic explosion of eye-melting opulence... a trip inside a disco ball that encompasses 34 songs, a flying horse, multiple dance showdowns and choreographed robots, all tethered to the pulsing heartbeat of Renaissance's club grooves.\n\nBut before all that, Beyonc\u00e9 wrongfoots everyone.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 took to the stage in a flowing blue ballgown long before sunset\n\nShe opens the show with four piano ballads from the start of her career - and they're not even the big ones like Halo or Irreplaceable.\n\nInstead, the set starts with Dangerously In Love, a Destiny's Child song that was reworked as the title track of her first solo album, and continues with deep cuts like 1+1 and Flaws And All.\n\nIt's a tease, for sure, but it also works as a Vegas-style overture. Before the more demanding, choreographed numbers that follow, Beyonc\u00e9 is free to walk the stage, chatting to fans and reading their signs. \"It's your birthday!\" she declares. \"I love you!\"\n\nShe also pauses to pay tribute to Tina Turner, an artist she has repeatedly called her greatest influence, after the singer's death last week.\n\n\"I want you to allow me to sing one of my favourite songs,\" she says, introducing a slow, gospel version Turner's River Deep, Mountain High.\n\n\"We love you, Tina,\" she adds, casting her eyes towards the sky.\n\nBefore long, however, the introductions are over. The video screen shows a pair of orbiting suns and informs us that the Beyonc\u00e9 we've just witnessed is no more. She's been reborn, rewired and transformed into a chrome-plated disco diva from another galaxy. An Alien Superstar.\n\nShe emerges encased in metal, and robotic arms slowly strip away her armour-plating as she performs Renaissance's declarative opener, I'm That Girl.\n\nThe show makes ample use of a stadium-wide video screen\n\nFrom here, we're plunged into pop spectacle, as the star careers through the album's 16-strong tracklist and remodels some of her classic hits in its image.\n\nRenaissance's best three-song sequence (Cuff It, Energy and Break My Soul) arrives intact, turning the Tottenham Stadium into a massive nightclub.\n\nArms flail and drinks are spilled as Beyonc\u00e9 and her dancers cavort across a circular catwalk to the middle of the audience, with the star dressed in an iridescent David Koma bodysuit, with matching knee-high boots.\n\nThe atmosphere intensifies with a stretch of harder-edged hits, including Formation and Black Parade.\n\nHere, Beyonc\u00e9 performs atop a giant silver tank, while her 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, leads the dance troupe to the front of the stage.\n\nIt's only her second-ever stage appearance but she's cool as a cucumber, marching in step with the professionals as 60,000 people look on.\n\nWhen the crowd bursts into applause, Beyonc\u00e9 acknowledges the response with a beaming, motherly smile - a rare glimpse behind her flawless perfectionism.\n\nBlue Ivy led the dancers during an explosive section of the set\n\nAs the concert segues into soul and R&B, Beyonc\u00e9 shows off some impressive, jazzy vocal runs during Plastic On The Sofa.\n\nThen she lets the audience take the reins on an ebullient Love On Top - leading them in an a capella rendition of the last four choruses, key changes and all, before declaring: \"I'll have to stop you there or you'd be going all night.\"\n\nBut the star claims her favourite song of the set is the sweaty, hedonistic club anthem Heated, which culminates in a frenetic rap directed at her detractors.\n\n\"Sometimes I mess up the words, so y'all got to help me,\" she tells us, apparently unaware that everyone can see the autocue that's been feeding her the lyrics throughout the show.\n\nThat's not a criticism, though. There's a lot to remember in this jaw-dropping show, where almost every song quotes another element of Beyonc\u00e9's catalogue. The irresistible electro-funk of Virgo's Groove, for example, incorporates elements of seven other songs - including Naughty Girl and the Destiny's Child classic Say My Name.\n\nElsewhere, Beyonc\u00e9 tips her hat to Madonna's Vogue, Kendrick Lamar's Alright, and the Jacksons' Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground).\n\nIt's a maximalist love letter to dance music that never feels forced or unwieldy.\n\nThe stage changes and morphs throughout the show, with new sets, props and costumes every few songs\n\nThe staging, too, takes the sort of more-is-more approach that's become necessary for a stadium concert.\n\nAt various points, Beyonc\u00e9 appears as Botticelli's Venus in a clamshell, as an Athena riding rockets through space, as a human embodiment of a stained glass window, and as a giant bee (a nod to her nickname, Queen Bey).\n\nThere are also dancers popping out of the stage like jack-in-the-boxes, a glitterball the size of a small caravan, a phenomenal amount of glitter, and - for the finale - Beyonc\u00e9 soaring around the stadium astride a giant silver horse, in a nod to Bianca Jagger at Studio 54.\n\nIt's fantastic and stupid and gleefully self-indulgent, which may disappoint people who came looking for the sort of socio-political commentary that Beyonc\u00e9 delivered on her album Lemonade and the subsequent Coachella performance (Lemonade's songs are conspicuously absent from this setlist).\n\nThe star wore a futuristic, all-red version of her outfit from the Formation video\n\nBut there is a deeper message under the surface - one of self-acceptance, tolerance and freedom from expectations.\n\nAs the audience arrives, the video screens display what looks like a TV test signal, but is in fact the colours of the Progress Pride flag.\n\nAt the end of the show, the same screens light up with a photo of Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina, and her \"godmother\" - her late uncle Jonny, a gay man who was HIV positive and introduced Beyonc\u00e9 to much of the music that features on Renaissance (as well as designing some of her early stage costumes).\n\nIn between, the show is narrated by legendary commentator Kevin JZ Prodigy, in an homage to the Ballroom subculture that originated amongst the black and Latino LGBTQ communities in New York; while Beyonc\u00e9 sings about quitting your job and throwing yourself headfirst into a a life of hedonistic pleasure (something she presumably allows herself to imagine once a day, just after breakfast, before snapping into a perfectly-timed dance break).\n\nIt all adds up to a message of acceptance and joy. Joy in being yourself, joy in dancing, joy in letting go, joy in being together.\n\nPerhaps that's why she saved the visuals for the tour: This is a record that needs to be experienced in real life, with other people.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's glitter ball horse has been nicknamed 'Reneigh' by fans", "Carrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken \"monstrous advantage of women\" between 2003 and 2020\n\nMore than 10 people have reported further offences by serial rapist and former police officer David Carrick since he was jailed, a force has said.\n\nCarrick was sentenced to 36 life terms after admitting 49 charges, including 24 counts of rape, in February.\n\nThe 48-year-old committed most of his offences in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe county's police force said it was working with prosecutors and investigating the new reports, which included allegations of sexual assault.\n\nCarrick's sentencing hearing was told he had taken \"monstrous advantage of women\" between 2003 and 2020, while serving as an officer with the Metropolitan Police.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The coastguard said later that no-one on board was wearing life jackets.\n\nIn a timeline provided by the coastguard, it said that initial contact was made with the fishing boat at 14:00 (11:00 GMT) and no request for help had been made.\n\nIt said the Greek shipping ministry had made repeated contact with the boat and was told repeatedly it simply wanted to sail on to Italy. A Maltese-flagged ship provided food and water at around 18:00, and another boat provided water three hours after that, it added.\n\nThen at around 01:40 on Wednesday someone on the boat is said to have notified the Greek coastguard that the vessel's engine had malfunctioned.\n\nShortly afterwards, the boat capsized, taking only ten to fifteen minutes to sink completely. A search and rescue operation was triggered but complicated by strong winds.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAlarm Phone, an emergency helpline for migrants in trouble at sea, complained that the coastguard was \"aware of the ship being in distress for hours before any help was sent\", adding that authorities \"had been informed by different sources\" that the boat was in trouble.\n\nIt added that people may have been scared to encounter Greek authorities because they were aware of the country's \"horrible and systematic pushback practices\".\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Tubiana of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res told French radio: \"It's really shocking to hear that Frontex flew over the boat and no-one intervened because the boat refused all offers of help... an overloaded boat is a boat in distress.\"\n\nThe boat is thought to have been going from Libya to Italy, with most of those on board believed to be men in their 20s.\n\nThey had been travelling for days, according to local media reports, which added that the boat had been approached by a Maltese cargo ship on Tuesday afternoon that supplied food and water.\n\nSurvivors spoke of as many as 500 to 750 people on board and regional health director Yiannis Karvelis warned of an unprecedented tragedy: \"The number of the people on board was much higher than the capacity that should be allowed for this boat.\"\n\nOne survivor told a hospital doctor in Kalamata that he had seen 100 children in the hold.\n\nCoastguard Cpt Nikolaos Alexiou told public TV that the boat had sunk in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe nationalities of the victims have not yet been announced.\n\nSurvivors have been taken to Kalamata, and many were treated in hospital for hypothermia or minor injuries.\n\nPublic broadcaster ERT said that three people suspected of being the traffickers had been taken to the central port authority in Kalamata and were being interrogated.\n\nGreek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou visited some of those rescued and expressed her sorrow for those who had drowned.\n\nEach year, hundreds of people die trying to cross the Mediterranean.

Some families have lost multiple children and this technique is seen as the only option for them to have a healthy child of their own.\n\nMitochondria are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy.\n\nDefective mitochondria fail to fuel the body and lead to brain damage, muscle wasting, heart failure and blindness.\n\nThey are passed down only by the mother. So mitochondrial donation treatment is a modified form of IVF that uses mitochondria from a healthy donor egg.\n\nThere are two techniques for performing mitochondrial donation. One takes places after the mother's egg has been fertilised by the father's sperm and the other takes place before fertilisation.\n\nHowever, mitochondria have their own genetic information or DNA which means that technically the resulting children inherit DNA from their parents and a smidge from the donor as well. This is a permanent change that would be passed down through the generations.\n\nThis donor DNA is only relevant for making effective mitochondria, does not affect other traits such as appearance and does not constitute a \"third parent\".\n\nThe technique was pioneered in Newcastle and laws were introduced to allow the creation of such babies in the UK in 2015.\n\nHowever, the UK did not immediately press ahead. The first baby born via this technique was to a Jordanian family having treatment in the US in 2016.\n\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the HFEA) is saying \"less than five\" babies have been born as of 20 April 2023. It is not giving precise numbers to prevent the families being identified.\n\nThese limited details have emerged after a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian newspaper.\n\n\"News that a small number of babies with donated mitochondria have now been born in the UK is the next step, in what will probably remain a slow and cautious process of assessing and refining mitochondrial donation,\" said Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust.\n\nThere has been no word from the teams in Newcastle so it is still uncertain whether the technique was successful.\n\nProf Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Research Institute, said: \"It will be interesting to know how well the mitochondrial replacement therapy technique worked at a practical level, whether the babies are free of mitochondrial disease, and whether there is any risk of them developing problems later in life.\"\n\nThere is technically a risk of \"reversion\" where any defective mitochondria that are carried over could gain in number and still result in disease.\n\nIt had once been estimated that up to 150 such babies could eventually be born each year in the UK.", "Cpl Luther Herschel Story was awarded the Medal of Honour for his heroism during the Korean War\n\nThe remains of a US soldier who died in the Korean War have been returned to his family for burial after 73 years.\n\nArmy Cpl Luther Herschel Story was 18 years old when he was presumed to have been killed in battle on 1 September, 1950, while covering his company's withdrawal after being wounded.\n\nHis remains were recovered about a month later but could not be identified with forensic techniques of the time.\n\nIn April, using DNA samples, the military was able to make a match.\n\nHe received a military burial on Monday near his hometown of Americus, Georgia.\n\nCpl Story has been recognised for his heroism during the Korean War.\n\nHe is believed to have killed or wounded an estimated 100 enemy soldiers as his company was coming under fire during a fierce daylight attack.\n\nHe was never seen alive again after that battle.\n\nHe was awarded the Medal of Honour for showing \"conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity\" by staying behind and fighting North Korean soldiers who were closing in on his squad.\n\nThe award, the country's highest military honour, was presented to his father in 1951.\n\n\"Cpl Story's extraordinary heroism, aggressive leadership, and supreme devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and were in keeping with the esteemed traditions of the military service,\" said his US army award citation.\n\nAn army private first class at the time, he was posthumously promoted to corporal.

Watch: Where is Yevgeny Prigozhin? And why does it matter?\n\nWagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin - who led a short-lived rebellion in Russia last month - is in Russia and not Belarus, the leader of Belarus says.\n\nPrigozhin's whereabouts have been a mystery since the mutiny.\n\nUnder the deal to end the stand-off, charges against him were dropped and he was offered a move to Belarus.\n\nBut on Thursday Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko said: \"As for Prigozhin, he's in St Petersburg. He is not on the territory of Belarus.\"\n\nIn response to Mr Lukashenko's remarks the Kremlin said it was \"not following\" Prigozhin's movements.\n\nMr Lukashenko had helped broker the deal to end the mutiny, and just over a week ago said Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus.\n\nThe BBC tracked Prigozhin's private jet flying to Belarus in late June, and returning to Russia the same evening.\n\nIt has since made several flights between St Petersburg and Moscow - although it is not clear if Prigozhin has been on board. The BBC also can't verify Mr Lukashenko's claim about the Wagner leader's current location.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Lukashenko added that \"as far as I know\" the rest of the Wagner fighters were still at their bases - which could include eastern Ukraine or a training base in Russia's Krasnodar region.\n\nThe Belarus leader said an offer for Wagner to station some of its fighters in Belarus - a prospect that has alarmed neighbouring Nato countries - still stands and he has offered several Soviet-era military sites for their use.\n\n\"But Wagner have a different vision,\" he said, adding: \"Of course I won't tell you about that.\"\n\n\"At present, the issue of their relocation has not been resolved.\"\n\nThe Wagner Group is a private army of mercenaries that has been fighting alongside the regular Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nIn his address Mr Lukashenko said he was not concerned about having Wagner fighters in Belarus, adding they would be in the country on \"certain conditions\".\n\n\"The main condition is that if we need to activate them for the defence of our country, then that will be done instantly, in any direction,\" Mr Lukashenko said as he praised Wagner's \"experience\".\n\nBut, he dismissed any potential threat of a Wagner-led mutiny in Belarus.\n\n\"All sorts of things happen in life, but I don't see that situation for now.\n\n\"If they come here, we will pay close attention to them,\" the Belarusian leader said.\n\nMr Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is widely thought to have rigged 2020 elections to maintain power.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian state TV appeared to turn on Prigozhin, with commentators across several networks attacking the Wagner Group mutiny as a premeditated act of treachery.\n\nOn NTV, anchors concentrated on Prigozhin's character, portraying him as a greedy and violent petty thief and referring to his past as being \"rich in criminality\".\n\nOn Rossiya 1 - one of Russia's most popular networks - hosts called for Prigozhin to face \"accountability\" for his rebellion and shared images from what officials said was a raid on his home in St Petersburg.\n\nOne clip showed a large stash of weapons - including assault rifles, pistols and ammunition - laid out on a bed.\n\nIn other clips, large piles of cash and gold bars, wigs and fake passports belonging to the Wagner chief were shown. Footage of a sledgehammer allegedly belonging to Prigozhin - likely referring to the one used to kill a Wagner deserter several months ago - was broadcast.\n\nWriting on the sledgehammer appeared to read: \"In case of important negotiations.\"\n\nHowever, some Telegram channels associated with the Wagner Group have claimed that the videos were staged and the house in question does not belong to the mercenary boss.\n\nPrigozhin's mutiny saw Wagner mercenaries cross from field camps in Ukraine into the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, seizing command of some military facilities.\n\nWagner fighters then travelled north towards Moscow, prompting the Kremlin to introduce tighter security in many regions, including the capital.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin later said Russian pilots were killed during the mutiny and it also appears to be the case that several aircraft were destroyed.\n\nMr Putin initially accused the group of treason, but under the deal that brought an end to the mutiny, Prigozhin was promised security and the Russian criminal case against Wagner was dropped.\n\nIts fighters were told they could either sign regular army contracts, go home or head to Belarus.\n\nRecent satellite images have shown what looks like tents being erected at a former military base close to Minsk, but there has been no sign yet that this has happened", "A poster for a West End play featuring a wedding cake was banned by Transport for London (TfL) because it was seen to promote \"foods high in fat, salt and sugar\".\n\nThe ad for Tony n' Tina's Wedding, a dinner show at Wonderville, Haymarket, featured a three-tier sponge cake.\n\nThe team spent \u00a320,000 on the posters to go on London's transport network.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \"We are always happy to work with brands to help them follow our advertising policy.\"\n\nThe interactive show is set at an Italian-American wedding, with a three-course meal, live music and dancing.\n\nProducer Paul Gregg told BBC London they could not run the posters after they delivered them to TfL.\n\nThe revised poster, right, depicted wedding guests instead\n\n\"They said 'you can't put these up, they've got cake on',\" he said. \"It was a bit of a surprise... the poster was designed at great expense to begin with.\"\n\nHis team spent a week creating the new design, costing an additional \u00a35,000.\n\nTfL said it refused to run 20 adverts displaying foods and non alcoholic drinks that were high in fat, sugar or salt, in the year 2021/22.\n\nA TfL spokesperson added: \"We welcome all advertising on our network that complies with our published guidance.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The then Soviet Union also supported North Korea in the war.\n\nSince the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia has remained a natural ally for North Korea because of their mutual dislike for the US. Washington has, in fact, accused North Korea of providing military aid to Russia in its war in Ukraine, a claim that both Pyongyang and Moscow deny.\n\nMr Shoigu's visit also comes against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions between the US and Russia over the Ukraine war.

With three runs required and less than five overs remaining, Cummins deflected Ollie Robinson towards third man, a diving Harry Brook fumbled and Australia had an incredible victory.\n\nA series that has already lived up to the hype continues with the second Test at Lord's on 28 June.\n\u2022 None 'Cummins is The Boss but England can come back'\n\u2022 None Relive an incredible day with all the best clips\n\u2022 None Watch the highlights on Today at the Test\n\nThis was not just an homage to the epic contest on the same ground 18 years ago, but the perfect opening to the most anticipated Ashes series in a generation.\n\nFrom the moment Zak Crawley crunched the first ball of the series for four, this Test had everything: England's daring first-day declaration, Root's attempted reverse-ramp off Cummins from the first ball of day four and the fascinating clash of style between the two teams.\n\nBut none of that could match the nerve-shredding drama of the final hour, played out in front of a buoyant crowd that had earlier waited until 14:15 BST for rain to pass and play to begin.\n\nEngland have been involved in some thrilling Tests since Stokes took charge, but none with the stakes as high as this. In truth, they wasted chances throughout, but have shown enough quality, endeavour and bravery to suggest they have what it takes to get back into the series.\n\nFor Australia, the narrow win just about vindicates their cautious approach to combatting England's Bazballers. It was fitting that captain Cummins, the architect of the safety-first plan, played the vital role on the final day.\n\nThis was magnificent sporting theatre, whetting the appetite for the rest of the series and for the Test between England and Australia's women, which begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nCummins and Lyon get revenge 18 years in the making\n\nIn 2005, Australia arrived on the fourth morning needing 107 with only two wickets remaining and almost got them thanks to the efforts of their last three batters - Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nFrom a position almost as hopeless, Cummins and Lyon launched their own rescue mission and this time got Australia over the line.\n\nThe tourists had been almost inert for most of the day. At 107-3 overnight, they did not shift from a neutral gear. Khawaja, who made a century in the first innings, added only 31 runs from 116 balls and looked immovable.\n\nStokes somehow conjured the slower ball from his fragile body and Root held on to Carey to make England favourites, but fearsome competitors Cummins and Lyon refused to yield.\n\nRoot had already failed to cling on to a low caught-and-bowled chance when Cummins had six and the captain would later make him pay by crashing 14 from a single over.\n\nIn the next over, Stokes flung himself at a catch that would have matched his grab in the 2019 World Cup, but this time could not hold on.\n\nThe new ball was belatedly taken, but Australia's confidence grew. For every time the outside edge was beaten, a single was pinched. Cummins slapped Robinson past a flying Ollie Pope at cover, Lyon twice belted Stuart Broad down the ground for fours.\n\nThe outside edge was beaten, England kept the field back, James Anderson was ignored. Australia were within one hit of victory for more than two overs.\n\nWith three required, Cummins fended off a short ball and the flailing Brook could not prevent the boundary. Australia ended on 282 - their target back in 2005 - and the brilliant Cummins threw his bat in the air to begin wild celebrations.\n\nEngland had lost two of their past 12 Tests and one of those, against New Zealand in Wellington in February, was by just one run after they had made the Black Caps follow on.\n\nThis, though, will test the resolve of their new attitude under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum like never before. Not because their swashbuckling style has failed its first examination by Australia, but because they were so close to winning and it is their own errors that have cost them.\n\nThey missed eight chances of varying difficulty in the field, four of which were by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Most crucially, Bairstow failed to move for an edge when Khawaja had only five on the fourth evening.\n\nQuestions will linger over Stokes' decision to declare on the first evening and the fitness of Moeen Ali, who was badly hampered by a cut on his spinning finger throughout the match.\n\nIt was also telling that Stokes, who is managing a left-knee injury, did not bowl himself until the 70th over of the second innings and that Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, was not trusted with the second new ball.\n\nNo team has come from behind to win an Ashes series since 2005.

Most state school teachers in England had a 5% rise in 2022.\n\nThe government says it is giving schools an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years. Most of the pay rise would have come from this money; schools would have received extra funding for the \u00a31,000 one-off payment and 0.5% of the pay increase for next year.\n\nLuke Sibieta, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said schools budgets could only absorb \"a small amount\" of the pay offer and that some schools were already seeing costs growing faster than funding.\n\nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) says there is \"only just enough headroom\" to cover the current pay offer.\n\nNatalie Perera, the Chief Executive of the EPI, warned that the current funding \"does not compensate schools for the additional support they have had to provide for increasingly vulnerable pupils\".\n\nIf you are a teacher, how are you affected by this latest development?

NAHT members voted in favour of strike action in January - but turnout was 42%, below the legal requirement of 50%.\n\nMary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, from the NEU, also questioned why teachers in England were \"worth less\" that those in Scotland and Wales. Education is a devolved matter, meaning decisions are made by the separate governments.\n\nIn Scotland, the dispute has been resolved after teachers accepted a 7% rise for 2022/23, which will be backdated to April.

Recently the prince opened an affordable housing project for young people with jobs, but who still needed help with accommodation.\n\nPrince William's plan is to bring together local coalitions of housing experts, charities and private industry to develop housing projects and support services, addressing different ways that homelessness occurs, whether in big cities or coastal towns.\n\nPrince William this month visited an affordable housing project in London for people who are in work or training\n\nHe has begun a two-day whistle-stop tour of the UK for what will be six locations for the initiative, which is backed by charities such as Shelter, Centrepoint, Crisis and The Passage.\n\nA media briefing was told that success would be measured in terms of lowering homelessness in those places - and finding approaches that could be replicated elsewhere.\n\nHe has also drawn international inspiration from Finland, seen as a model for reducing homelessness to very low levels.\n\nThe campaign has published opinion polling from Ipsos of more than 3,000 adults in the UK, which suggests the level of public concern and support for an intervention.\n\nBut Prince William will also face challenges about how someone with such wealth and extensive property holdings can make such calls over homelessness.\n\n\"The last thing we need is for William to get involved in this issue, a man who has three huge homes and a vast estate gifted to him by the state,\" says Graham Smith, of the anti-monarchy group, Republic.\n\nHe says homelessness is about government policy and investment and will not be \"resolved by charity or royal patronage\", accusing Prince William of being \"hypocritical\".\n\nPrince William with his mother and brother at The Passage homelessness charity in 1993\n\nBut a Kensington Palace spokesman said it was about the prince using his public platform to make a positive difference.\n\n\"This isn't about a PR stunt. This is about trying to change the way that we as a society think about homelessness,\" said the spokesman.\n\nMatt Downie, chief executive of the charity Crisis, said he had personally spoken to the Prince of Wales about the project and endorsed the authenticity of his commitment.\n\n\"People who are experiencing homelessness can smell when someone's not authentic. I certainly can see the difference between people who want to associate for PR purposes in this issue and people who are genuinely driven by righting one of society's wrongs, and I saw that deeply there,\" said Mr Downie.\n\nRoyal author and academic Prof Pauline Maclaran said such an activist approach was likely to go down well with a younger generation, who were more likely to question the value of the monarchy.\n\nBut she said it would need the prince to be seen to make a personal contribution. His Royal Foundation is providing \u00a3500,000 in seed funding at each of the six regional centres for the project, but so far there has been no confirmation of earlier reports of social housing plans for his Duchy of Cornwall estate.\n\nHistorian Sir Anthony Seldon said Prince William's initiative showed how royal interventions could look beyond short-term political cycles at wider issues such as \"the mental health and welfare of the population, the physical and built environment, and the economic condition of the people\".\n\nBut he said it meant the prince was \"squarely in the space normally reserved just for elected politicians\".\n\nPolitical parties are already sparring over the response to rising mortgage and rent costs and a lack of affordable housing.\n\nCllr Darren Rodwell, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said councils feared a \"national homelessness crisis\" - and there were 1.2 million people on council waiting lists for housing in England.\n\nHe said there was a perfect storm of \"depleting housing stock and an unaffordable and overly-competitive private rented market\" and renters facing eviction - and he called for councils to be able to build 100,000 new social rent homes each year.\n\nBut Prince William said he was confident about the ambition to fundamentally reduce homelessness.\n\n\"I want to make this a reality and, over the next five years, give people across the UK hope that homelessness can be prevented when we collaborate,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities welcomed the prince's initiative.\n\n\"We are giving councils \u00a32bn over three years, to help them tackle homelessness and rough sleeping, targeted to areas where it is needed most,\" she said.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Temperature reached 32.2C in June and the heat was long-lasting\n\nThe UK's hottest June on record caused unprecedented deaths of fish in rivers and disturbed insects and plants, environment groups have warned.\n\nNature is being \"pounded by extreme weather without a chance to recover\", the Wildlife Trusts said.\n\nThe Met Office will say later on Monday if the high temperatures were linked to climate change.\n\nPeople also used more water with demand increasing by 25% at peak times in some areas, said Water UK.\n\nThe Met Office said last week that provisional figures for June indicate that both the overall average and the average maximum temperatures were the highest on record.\n\n\"The reports of the number of fish death incidents in rivers for this time of year has been unprecedented. I would normally expect rivers to be affected later in the summer when it's hotter and drier,\" Mark Owen, from the Angling Trust, told BBC News.\n\nIn one case, sea trout were found dead on the River Wear in north-east England, he said.\n\nThe deaths are partly caused by less oxygen in the water as river levels decrease. Fish also die when dried-up pollutants from cars and lorries on roads wash into rivers during flash storms.\n\nThe Environment Agency said it received more reports of dead fish than the same time last year.\n\nMass fish deaths can be caused by a range of factors including low water levels, pollution, and disease.\n\nMany flowering plants, including orchids, wilted in the high temperatures, meaning insects like bees and butterflies that feed on nectar and pollen will have less to eat, Ali Morse from the Wildlife Trusts told BBC News.\n\nSpecies with short lifespans are particularly badly affected. Many butterflies are adults for only a short time, and if they cannot access food in that period, it stunts the population.\n\nThese impacts are more surprising considering the wet and cold spring and are earlier than last year, Ms Morse added.\n\n\"Every month seems to be the hottest, the driest, the wettest, or whichever record-breaking event it is. If we have a one-off pollution event or a wildfire, then there is normally time for nature to bounce back, but now it seems to be continually pounded by extreme weather,\" she added.\n\nMore frequent and more intense periods of warm weather are putting pressure on the UK's environment and water supplies.\n\nAs temperatures rise, people also use more water in their homes. Last July and August water companies supplied 1.2 billion litres more water than the same months in 2021, according to Water UK.\n\nPeople in Devon, Cornwall and parts of the south-east of England are under hosepipe bans.\n\nWater experts say that rivers and reservoirs, which provide much of the UK's drinking water, are in a healthier position than the same time last year.\n\nBut the dry weather is likely to have an impact on water supplies and if warm weather continues, those supplies could be depleted quickly.\n\nWater UK is urging homes and businesses to \"continue to save water to help safeguard against potential future drought conditions\".\n\nPeople can play their part in helping nature withstand the impacts of extreme heat with small, simple actions, Ms Morse explains.\n\nA bowl of water in a garden or yard can provide water for thirsty hedgehogs, bees and butterflies.\n\nAnd longer grass is more resilient in hotter weather and gives species a much-needed habitat to live in, so she suggests letting even small areas of lawn grow taller.", "Five teachers at a preschool in Taiwan have been accused of drugging students\n\nInvestigations into the drugging of preschool children in Taiwan have sparked widespread alarm on the island.\n\nTeachers at a kindergarten in New Taipei City have been accused of sedating students with cough syrups containing drugs like phenobarbital and benzodiazepines.\n\nPolice have been investigating for weeks and say it's not clear why the children were fed the addictive syrups.\n\nBut the scandal has sparked family protests outside government buildings.\n\nHundreds joined a demonstration in New Taipei City on Sunday calling for greater transparency from the police investigation, with many criticising authorities for their lack of public disclosure.\n\nOn Monday, a separate case also emerged concerning a medical practice in the southern city of Kaohsiung, on the other end of the island.\n\nThe local health department there found four doctors guilty of misconduct and improper use of phenobarbital on about 20 children. They were ordered to suspend their practice for six months, and were fined 1.4m Taiwanese dollars (\u00a335,989, $46,121).\n\nAmid growing public concern, Taipei City Hospital has also begun offering free blood tests for preschool children to check for traces of sedatives.\n\nThe measures come after the scandal first emerged in May, when parents at a private preschool in New Taipei City accused staff of feeding their children \"unknown drugs\".\n\nMike, a father of a five-year-old child, told BBC Chinese that parents had noticed what appeared to be withdrawal symptoms in their children over the long Lunar New Year holiday period in February.\n\n\"Some parents found their children, over the vacation, had become irritable, restless and screamed when sleeping, and even cried out with leg cramps,\" he said.\n\nAfter speaking to the children, parents learnt that their teachers had fed them an \"unknown potion\". Complaints were filed with police in April and May.\n\nFollowing more complaints from parents in June, local authorities launched an investigation, and found at least eight children with trace amounts of phenobarbital and benzodiazepines - a class of psychoactive drugs - in their system.\n\nThe kindergarten at the centre of the controversy, a franchise of the Kid Castle Educational Institute, was ordered to shut down on 12 June.

We have to move fast but we cannot be careless.\"\n\nGovernor Moore said that after a 10-hour operation, Unified Command was able to cut and lift a 200-tonne span of the bridge \"almost the size of the Statue of Liberty\".\n\n\"It's a small piece of what we're talking about,\" he said. \"The scale of this project, to be clear, it is enormous, and even the small lifts are huge.\"\n\nThose involved in the clean-up have been cutting debris from the bridge into smaller pieces that can be removed and taken to a disposal site.\n\nCranes have been erected on the site to help lift debris from the bridge. That includes the Chesapeake 1000, the largest crane on the eastern US seaboard.\n\nThe temporarily channel that opened on Monday would help officials get more vessels into the water around the site of the collapse, Governor Moore said.\n\nThe taskforce set up in the wake of the disaster said the temporary route was for \"commercially essential vessels\", and had been opened as part of a \"phased approach to opening the main channel\".\n\nCurrently, a 2,000-yard (1,828-metre) safety zone exists around the wreckage, preventing all vessels and people from entering the area without permission from port officials.\n\nRoughly 80-90% of the bridge wreckage is currently underwater, according to officials.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It's incredible.\n\n\"What an incredible career he's had and he's still got to get this record at the Tour and hopefully win a stage here.\"\n\nBritish Cycling performance director Stephen Park said: \"Cav is without doubt the sport's greatest sprinter and will be remembered by fans across the world for his 53 Grand Tour stage wins.\n\n\"What most stands out in Cav as a sportsperson is the overwhelming sense of pride he showed each time he pulled on both the Great Britain cycling team and British national champion's jerseys - a quality we want to instil in every single member of our team.\"", "Prof Chris Whitty has been a key government adviser during the pandemic\n\nThreats to independent experts during the pandemic could undermine responses to disasters in the future, Prof Sir Chris Whitty has warned.\n\nGiving evidence to the Covid public inquiry, England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris, said abuse and threats aimed at experts had been \"extremely concerning\".\n\nIn January 2022, a man was jailed for eight weeks after he accosted Sir Chris in a London park.\n\nDuring the hearings into the two men the courts were told how one man, Jonathan Chew, 24, started filming Sir Chris on his phone while another, Lewis Hughes, also 24, grabbed him in a headlock.\n\nThe footage, lasting about 20 seconds, was widely shared on social media and showed the pair jeering as Sir Chris attempted to break free.\n\nEngland's chief medical officer was not injured in the attack during the summer of 2021.\n\nAs well as the incident, Sir Chris and others have reported being abused on social media, as well as being shouted at in public.\n\nSir Chris told the inquiry: \"We should be very firm in saying that society very much appreciates the work of these people [experts and scientists], who put in considerable amounts of time.\"\n\nHe said it was often provided without pay and also noted how universities were becoming stricter about releasing their academics.\n\nInquiry chair Baroness Hallett said she was \"astonished and sorry\" about what had happened.\n\nAfter Sir Chris had finished giving evidence on Thursday into how well prepared the UK was for the pandemic, she said: \"It's wrong for so many reasons, but I do know how distressing it can be.\n\n\"I hope that people will think twice but of course they never do before committing themselves to distressing acts unnecessarily.\n\n\"There are so many different ways to express different opinion. Why do we have to have personal abuse?\"\n\nDuring the rest of his evidence, Sir Chris said one of the key weaknesses the UK faced was the inability to scale up testing quickly.\n\nAnd he described the national lockdown as the \"very big new idea\" of the Covid pandemic and \"very radical thing to do\".\n\n\"It was an extraordinarily major, social intervention with huge economic and social ramifications.\"\n\nSir Chris also defended the government scientific advisory group Sage, which he co-chaired during the pandemic, after suggestions there was not enough diversity of thought within the group.\n\nThere were no economic or social experts for example.\n\nBut Sir Chris said it would have been too \"unwieldly\" if a range of different experts were added to it.\n\nInstead, he said the economic and societal consequences of responding to a pandemic should be done separately through a different mechanism.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic, said it was a \"regret\" that during the pandemic it often took a long period of time for Sage research to be published.\n\n\"I believe that scientific advice should be made public - that's beneficial for everybody,\" he said.\n\nHe added it should always be open to \"scrutiny, comment and challenge\".\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Lee Anderson on the 1970s: \"Our garden was our food bank.\"\n\nPeople struggling with living costs were \"more resourceful\" in previous decades, the Tory deputy chairman has said.\n\nLee Anderson told the BBC there was a \"different culture\" in his youth, and people were more likely to take on extra work.\n\nThe MP - who grew up in a mining town - has faced criticism for previously questioning the need for food banks.\n\nRecalling his childhood, he said \"our garden was our foodbank\".\n\nHe said his parents had \"made do\" in the 1970s, despite growing up in an environment that people today would see as \"very, very, poor\".\n\nBut speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, he said: \"We didn't think we were in poverty.\n\n\"Things were more expensive I think back in the Seventies. Food was definitely more expensive, relatively speaking,\" he told the podcast.\n\n\"We had one holiday a year, which was a caravan in Skegness. We had a garden full of vegetables, [with] chickens at the bottom for the eggs.\n\n\"Perhaps if some people today could go back in a time machine and see how we lived, they'd think we were very, very, poor. But I didn't see that at the time.\"\n\nWhen challenged that people some parts of the country today would not have a garden to grow vegetables in, he replied: \"The point I was making was people were more resourceful when I was growing up as a child.\n\n\"They were more resourceful. My parents were the children of men that had fought in the war, they'd gone through very, very difficult times.\n\n\"So it was a different culture, there was a different outlook on life. And they made do.\n\n\"My dad always said to me - if you need more money, go and work a weekend shift, do a bit of overtime. It wasn't 'complain on Facebook or Twitter or go and do a TikTok video or just complain to government'.\"\n\nPolitical opponents of the Tory deputy chairman have tried to use his ability to hit headlines against him\n\nMr Anderson, who grew up in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, a former mining area which he now represents as MP, was appointed deputy Tory chairman by Rishi Sunak last month.\n\nSince then he has found himself at the centre of media storms for his outspoken views on issues such as migrant Channel crossings, his support for the death penalty, and the use of food banks.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was branded \"out of touch\" last year for suggesting people needed to learn how to cook and budget \"properly\", rather than use food banks.\n\nHe later defended his comments, saying he was glad to have started a \"debate\" on the issue.\n\nIn his interview with Nick Robinson, he said anyone earning an annual salary of \u00a335,000 \"should not be using a food bank\" when asked about a row over whether nurses had used the resource.\n\nHe said that whenever he talked about the issue, his inbox was flooded with people making supportive comments \"saying 'you know what Lee, thank goodness somebody is speaking out, we actually agree with you'\".\n\nPressed on whether higher housing costs in places like Barking, a London borough, could lead people on this income to use a food bank, he replied: \"Where are they?\"\n\n\"I get pensioners contacting me from southern constituencies who are on peanuts, there's on less than twenty grand a year, they're not using foodbanks.\"\n\nAt a parliamentary debate following his interview, Mr Anderson went on to say food banks were \"being abused,\" with some families treating them \"like a weekly shop\".\n\nHe said there was a need for more education, to help families struggling with food costs to cook cheaper meals.\n\nHis comments earned him a rebuke from Labour MP Fleur Anderson, who accused him of making \"provocative statements completely detached from the facts\".\n\n\"There's a reason for [the] huge increase in needing to go to foodbanks, and that is because the system is entirely broken, and that is after 13 years of the Conservatives breaking that system,\" she added.\n\nThere was also criticism from the SNP's Patricia Gibson, who said food bank use was increasing because of rising prices, and compared Mr Anderson to \"Mr Scrooge without the compassion\".\n\nShe accused him of trying to \"lecture\" people who were struggling with living costs, branding it \"staggeringly insensitive\".", "Former official Sue Gray broke civil service rules after failing to declare contact with Labour over a job offer, the Cabinet Office has said.\n\nMs Gray, who led a probe into lockdown parties in Downing Street, was cleared to work for Labour by Parliament's appointments adviser last week.\n\nIt said she could start as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff in September.\n\nLabour said all rules were followed and branded the finding a \"political stunt\".\n\nThe party said the Cabinet Office had \"spent weeks wasting time on this Mickey Mouse nonsense\".\"We're looking forward to Sue Gray joining us this September as we continue to show the country that only Labour can build a better Britain,\" a Labour spokesperson said.\n\nLabour said Ms Gray only had one phone call with Sir Keir before she resigned in March, and the conversation did not relate to any government business.\n\nCivil servants - who develop and implement government policies - are expected to be politically impartial.\n\nIn a statement, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin said the government's inquiry found the code \"was prima facie broken as a result of the undeclared contact between Ms Gray and the leader of the opposition\".\n\nMr Quin said Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations but chose not to do so.\n\nHowever, the Cabinet Office cannot impose any retrospective punishments, as Ms Gray is no longer working for the government.\n\n\"The rules and guidance that govern the conduct of civil servants are clear and transparent,\" Mr Quin said. \"It is deeply unfortunate that events have transpired in this way.\"\n\nMs Gray was thrust into the public spotlight last year when she led an investigation into gatherings in government offices during the Covid-19 pandemic, while Boris Johnson was prime minister.\n\nHer report found staff attended events on multiple occasions while the rest of the UK was in lockdown, and partly blamed the leadership in Downing Street.\n\nMr Johnson faced calls to resign following the report, which contributed to the Tory disquiet that led to his downfall as prime minister.\n\nSome Tories had expressed anger that Ms Gray was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff, arguing it undermined the impartiality of her inquiry into lockdown-breaking parties.\n\nLast week, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) said Ms Gray had to wait until September to start her new role with Labour.\n\nMs Gray told Acoba she received a call from Sir Keir in October last year, when he raised the idea of her working for Labour in a senior capacity.\n\nThe committee said it was \"quite normal for individuals to discuss the possibility of new roles before leaving office\" but \"any potential conflict must be declared\".\n\nThe committee said there was no evidence her contact with Labour had impacted her actions in her civil service role or her ability to remain impartial.\n\nHowever, it said there remained \"a potential risk to the perceived impartiality of the civil service that would be exacerbated\" if she took up the job immediately on leaving office.\n\nAs well as a six-month break, the committee also recommended Ms Gray should not be personally involved in lobbying the government on behalf of the opposition for two years from the date she left the civil service.\n\nWith a general election expected next year, Ms Gray will play a key role in helping Labour prepare for government, if it wins power.", "Executions at the Oklahoma Department of Corrections became more difficult after the supply of a drug used in lethal injections was cut off\n\nWhen the supply of drugs used for lethal injections began to run out, a couple of prison guards in the US had to go out and find another source.\n\nFor over 20 years, Randy Workman was the man who walked people to their death.\n\nAs a senior corrections officer in the state of Oklahoma, he personally participated in 32 executions in various roles, including escorting prisoners, selecting executioners and sourcing lethal injection drugs.\n\n\"You could tell the moment they expired. You watch enough of them, you can just tell immediately they were gone,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBut his job took an unexpected turn in 2010, when Hospira, the maker of the drug sodium thiopental, stopped production in the US due to an unspecified issue with obtaining raw materials.\n\nThe drug, which renders a person unconscious and suppresses the nervous system, was one of three drugs in a cocktail widely used in executions, and the oldest drug to be approved for capital punishment.\n\nThe company tried to move production to Italy in 2011, where capital punishment is illegal, but the country refused to allow it unless Hospira could guarantee it wouldn't be used in executions.\n\nSo it became Mr Workman's job to find the drug from alternative sources.\n\n\"You felt isolated because you felt like the world was mad at you,\" he said.\n\n\"It made you feel like you're doing something wrong. If you believe in the death penalty, we're really not.\"\n\nAt one point, Mr Workman was able to make connections with a drug company in India that looked like it would be able to deliver a supply unimpeded, but he abandoned the idea when he found the company didn't have the approval process used in the US.\n\nIt meant he couldn't guarantee what the drugs would do, if used.\n\n\"That was a scary thought. You don't really know what you're getting into and really can't take chances on the process,\" he said.\n\nIn the state of Arizona, prison boss Carson McWilliams was also on the search for lethal dugs.\n\nCarson McWilliams said he was involved in 29 executions while working for the Arizona Department of Corrections\n\nHe had been calling around US based pharmaceutical companies asking if they had any drugs left over from previous shipments.\n\n\"I probably contacted every drug company there was that I knew of. Most of them wouldn't even talk to me.\"\n\nWhen none did, he too turned to the India supplier. In his case, he did order a few shipments, as did the Texas Correctional Department.\n\nIt was vital to procure the drugs, Mr McWilliams said, because in Arizona when a warrant for execution is issued, a penitentiary has 31 days to fulfil it before the warrant expired, at which point they would have to start the process again.\n\n\"That clock starts ticking. You're under the gun to make it happen. So you have to be creative and do what you got to do to make it happen,\" he said.\n\nBut when the drugs arrived in the US, federal officials confiscated them, putting Mr McWilliams back at square one.\n\nThat's when he made a connection with a pharmacist in England who could supply sodium thiopental. At that time, supply of the chemical was legal.\n\n\"It felt good because we know what these drugs are and we've used them before. And so we feel really confident that these drugs are fine,\" he said.\n\nBut the supplier wasn't a big drug company. In fact, Medhi Alawi operated out of an address which apparently also operated as a driving school in Acton, London.\n\nHundreds of vials of white powder had been parcelled into a cardboard box and sent off to Carson McWilliam's office in Florence, Arizona, making him one of the last suppliers in the US.\n\nWord got round with prison authorities across the country, and soon emails were flying around between correctional officers, requesting access to the drugs ordered from the UK.\n\n\"May have a secret and important mission for you,\" read one email between Scott, the boss of San Quentin Correctional Department, and his officer, Tony.\n\n\"I might need one of your SoCal guys to go to Florence, AZ and pick up a quantity of the drug and drive it to SQ.\"\n\nThe men who came, he says, \"might have been in a rock band as opposed to being a couple of people coming over from California department of Corrections\u2026 they had real big beards\".\n\nAfterward he received an email from the California team: \"You guys in Arizona are life savers - Buy you a beer next time I get that way.\"\n\nMr McWilliams thought they had cracked their hunt for life-ending drugs but most of the shipment from London was confiscated by the US Food and Drug Administration because of licensing issues.\n\nSome vials of the drugs, however, had already been used to carry out executions in Arizona and Georgia.\n\nIn 2011, the UK made it illegal to export drugs for use in capital punishment.\n\nWithout a steady supply of sodium thiopental coming from the UK, the search continued for years. Controversially, some states even tried different drug combinations in executions.\n\nJoel Zivot, an associate professor at the Emory University School of Medicine who has campaigned against lethal injection procedures for the past decade, said drugs and other medical tools should not be used in executions.\n\n\"No serious pharmaceutical company is producing medicines with execution in mind. When the Department of Corrections uses medicine to kill, it is a misuse of that product,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHe said that rather than end production of drugs that have other therapeutic purposes, governments ought to step in and pass regulations that restrict how these drugs are used.\n\nSome, including Mr McWilliams, who supports the death penalty, thought that the new drug combinations had different effects than the original formula.\n\n\"The original drug cocktail that people use - everyone knew it worked well and there was no issues with it. Some of the other drugs weren't quite as effective, so that did cause executions to last longer,\" he said.\n\nLawyers for convicted murderer Joseph Wood sued to halt his execution over concerns about the supply of the drugs used in Arizona. The Supreme Court eventually allowed his execution to go ahead in 2014, but the procedure took almost two hours and resulted in him being injected 15 times.\n\nThat led Arizona to temporarily halt executions to review the state's procedures. Capital punishment only restarted in the state in 2022.\n\nCharles Ryan, director of Arizona's department of corrections, said in a statement after Wood's execution: \"Once the inmate was sedated, he did not grimace or make any further movement.\" He said he \"was assured unequivocally that the inmate was comatose and never in pain or distress\".\n\nAlso in 2014, the execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma failed and he died shortly after of a heart attack. Some blamed a previously-unused drug cocktail that was used, while reports also suggested a problem with the IV used to administer the drug.\n\nThe failure was condemned by the UN and President Barack Obama, and helped shine a harsh light on capital punishment in the US - the only democracy in the western world to still carry out executions. Many have argued the use of newer drugs and combinations of drugs violated the US constitution's prohibition against \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\nBut despite concerns, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the legality of the death penalty - and the use of lethal injection drugs.\n\nToday, the death penalty continues, but it has declined steadily, and concerns about the methods used remain.\n\nOklahoma is one of just five US states to have actually carried out an execution in 2023.\n\nRight now, there are approximately 2,400 prisoners in US penitentiaries on death row. At the time of writing, 20 prisoners had been put to death in 2023, down from its modern-era peak in 1999 when there were 98 executions carried out by 20 states across the US.\n\nMore than 60 global pharmaceutical companies won't allow their drugs to be used in capital punishment.\n\nWithout reliable access, five states - Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Utah and South Carolina - have passed laws to allow prisoners to choose to die by firing squad as an alternative.\n\nDeborah Denno, a professor of law from the Fordham Law School in New York City, says the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs is one of the reasons for the decline in the number of executions.\n\nShe said executions have always had an \"element of secrecy associated with them. But that secrecy became more pronounced\" after drug shortages became widespread.\n\nSome states even brought in laws to keep information about what drugs were being used a secret, like Georgia's Lethal Injection Secrecy Act in 2013.\n\nThis raised concerns, she said. Although she does not oppose the death penalty, she is critical of the methods currently being used.\n\n\"They will say that they have secrecy as security issues to protect what goes on inside a prison. But there's absolutely no reason why we can't know what kinds of drugs are being used.\"\n\nPaul Cassell, a Professor of Law at University of Utah who supports the death penalty, said the drug issue has been seized upon by campaigners.\n\nHe believes the shortage of lethal injection drugs is \"used as a kind of choke point to block the death penalty\".\n\nRandy Workman was a corrections officer for over 20 years\n\nBoth Randy Workman and Carson McWilliams are now retired.\n\nMr McWilliams was involved in 29 executions while working for the corrections department.\n\n\"I didn't grow up thinking, hey, this is what I want to do for a living. It's just what happened to my job.\"\n\nMr Workman still lives near the Oklahoma State Penitentiary on a small farm, about two hours outside Oklahoma city.\n\nIt's a quiet spot, and a world away from the high security jail filled with 1,200 inmates where he spent his working life.\n\nHe is happy in retirement, relaxed and cheerful. He loves his wife and his goats, but he's also held onto some memorabilia from his time working in corrections, including a knife confiscated as prison contraband.\n\nReflecting on his years spent hunting down life-ending drugs, Mr Workman said \"it was a horrible problem. It was like dealing with a dope dealer\".\n\nHe supports the death penalty, but was \"ready to get out of it\" and now does pastoral outreach in prison.\n\n\"I don't like watching people die. I don't care what they've done. They're still people,\" he said.", "Cardiff student Alice Moore says she should not have to \"scrimp\" due to her disability\n\nMost people are affected by the cost of living crisis, but for those like Alice Moore, it is even more of an issue.\n\nThe 21-year-old Cardiff University student has cystic fibrosis, meaning she cannot easily cut her spending on food for health reasons.\n\nShe must buy specific products not often available in more affordable supermarkets, which has become harder since prices have soared.\n\n\"I do financially worry anyway,\" she said.\n\n\"It's annoying that it's not a choice I can make to scrimp on things because of my disability.\n\n\"I have to dip into my own money [to cover it],\" she said. \"It shouldn't be that way, and I have to scrimp and save on other things now because I need to afford food.\"\n\nDisabled Students UK, the biggest disabled student-led organisation in the country, said the lack of support for students like her is \"really disappointing\".\n\nThe Welsh government has said it is committed to supporting disabled students through the cost of living crisis, but the National Union of Students (NUS) Wales believed more could be done to \"ensure a level playing field\".\n\nAnother disabled student, Hannah Stansfield, 25, said: \"I can't eat a lot of foods because of sensory overload. I can't just go and find a cheaper version.\n\n\"It's a big stress right now.\"\n\nThe Cardiff Metropolitan student has autism and said she must often buy \"really expensive\" brands as they are the only things she can eat.\n\nBoth students receive personal independence payments (PIP), a government benefit that helps disabled people with living costs.\n\nThe two components to PIP are daily living and mobility. In April, the maximum daily living component rose from \u00a392.40 to \u00a3101.75 a week, while the maximum mobility component rose from \u00a364.50 to \u00a371.\n\nBut Amelia McLoughlan of Disabled Students UK said this \"certainly\" does not reflect inflation.\n\n\"It's a \u00a330 increase, the PIP uplift as they're calling it - it isn't much of an uplift,\" she said.\n\nShe said many disabled students cannot cut spending in areas where other students might, so PIP \"doesn't cover the potential extra cost [of being disabled].\"\n\nAlice mainly spends her PIP on food, but said the remainder goes on travel to hospital appointments.\n\n\"Where PIP payment hasn't been increased to reflect inflation, I do find myself having to dip into my own money to pay for things,\" she said.\n\nAnother form of financial help available to disabled students is the Disabled Students Allowance (DSA), which is intended to cover study-related costs like specialist equipment. This academic year, students can receive up to \u00a326,291 a year for support.\n\nBut in 2022, a report by Lord Holmes of Richmond showed just 29% of students in England and Wales with a known disability are receiving DSA, with some students reporting a \"time-consuming\" and \"overly-bureaucratic\" process.\n\nCardiff Metropolitan student Jasmine Treharne, 20, who said it takes a \"minimum of six weeks\" for her to be refunded for any purchases, which can be inconvenient.\n\nHelen Saelensminde, chief executive of the Snowdon Trust - a charity that provides disabled students with grants and scholarships - agreed that there are issues with the allowance.\n\n\"For some disabled students, their costs go way beyond the limits of DSA,\" she said.\n\nJasmine Treharne worries that taking on any extra responsibilities to earn money would cause her studies to suffer\n\nThe option to supplement loans and grants with income from part-time work is not open to many disabled students.\n\nHaving been diagnosed with dyslexia at university, Jasmine previously struggled with time management and organisation. She worries that extra responsibilities could lead to her failing.\n\n\"Right now, with the help I'm getting, I'm quite okay with the study, but I feel like if I get a part-time job, I'm not going to have enough time to focus on my studies,\" she said.\n\n\"It's quite a struggle. I have to ask to borrow money from people and I go overdrawn in my bank.\"\n\nDisability charity Scope reported earlier this year that disabled households face an additional \u00a31,122 a month on average to have the same standard of living as non-disabled households.\n\nMs McLoughlan said this meant the cost of living crisis was having a \"serious\" affect on disabled students.\n\n\"It's hard to quantify because different campuses are going to have specific issues,\" she said.\n\nShe added that if nothing changes, it would be \"survival of the fittest, and that's really worrying\".\n\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) Wales said disabled students were among those \"hit hardest by cruel cuts to services\".\n\nThe Welsh government said it was investing \u00a317.7m to enable further education providers to support students with additional learning needs.\n\n\"We are committed to supporting all disabled students through the cost of living crisis, so they can continue to access the education they need to develop the skills required to reach their full potential.\"\n\nThe UK government has been asked to comment.", "South Korean soldiers stand guard in the village of Panmunjom in the Joint Security Area\n\nNorth Korea is believed to have detained a serving US army soldier who crossed the heavily fortified border from South Korea without permission.\n\nThe man, identified by the Pentagon as Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King, 23, was on an organised tour of the UN-run zone dividing the two countries.\n\nThe crisis comes during a particularly tense time with the North, one of the world's most isolated states.\n\nA senior US commander said there had been no contact with the soldier.\n\nAdmiral John Aquilino Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command said he was \"not tracking\" contact with North Korea.\n\nHe said PV2 King had acted willingly by \"making a run\" across the border without authorisation, and the incident was being investigated by US Forces Korea.\n\nOn its travel advisory, the US tells its citizens not to travel to North Korea due to \"the continuing serious risk of arrest\" and the \"critical threat of wrongful detention\".\n\nHours after his detention, North Korea launched two suspected ballistic missiles into the nearby sea, however there has been no suggestion that it is tied to the soldier's detention.\n\nSouth Korea's military confirmed the missile launch, which comes as tensions run high on the Korean peninsula.\n\nIt is unclear if the soldier has defected to North Korea or hopes to return, and there has been no word yet from the North.\n\nIn a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson said that PV2 King had been in the army since January 2021.\n\nHe is a cavalry scout - a reconnaissance specialist - originally assigned to an element of the army's 1st Armoured Division on a rotation with the US military in South Korea.\n\nBut he got into trouble there - officials in Seoul have confirmed that he spent two months in prison for assault charges.\n\nThe Yonhap news agency quoted \"legal sources\" as saying that he was fined for \"repeatedly kicking\" the back door of a police patrol vehicle in the capital's Mapo district, and shouted \"foul language\" at the police who apprehended him.\n\nHe was also suspected of punching a Korean national at a nightclub in September, the report said.\n\nIt is unclear if these were the reasons for his imprisonment.\n\nPV2 King was released from prison on 10 July and was escorted to the airport for a US-bound flight.\n\nSeoul officials said he passed through airport security but then somehow managed to leave the terminal and get on a tour of the border, from where he crossed over into North Korea.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAn eyewitness on the same tour told the BBC's US partner CBS News that they had visited a building at the border site - reported by local media to be the truce village of Panmunjom - when \"this man gives out a loud 'ha ha ha' and just runs in between some buildings\".\n\n\"I thought it was a bad joke at first but, when he didn't come back, I realised it wasn't a joke and then everybody reacted and things got crazy,\" they said.\n\nThe United Nations Command, which operates the Demilitarised Zone and joint security area (JSA), said earlier its team had made contact with the North Korean military to try to negotiate his release.\n\n\"We believe he is currently in DPRK [North Korean] custody and are working with our KPA [Korean People's Army - North Korea's military] counterparts to resolve this incident,\" it said.\n\nIt is unclear where or in what conditions PV2 King is being held.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told the BBC that authorities in the North were likely to \"try pump information out of him\" about his military service and \"try to coerce him into becoming a propaganda tool\".\n\nThe Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separates the two Koreas and is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.\n\nIt is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing and surveillance cameras. Armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day.\n\nThe DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war.\n\nDozens of people try to escape North Korea every year, fleeing poverty and famine, but defections across the DMZ are extremely dangerous and rare. The country sealed its borders in 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to reopen them.\n\nThe last time a soldier defected at the JSA was in 2017, when a North Korean soldier drove a vehicle, then ran by foot across the military demarcation line, South Korea said at the time.\n\nThe soldier was shot at 40 times, but survived.\n\nBefore the pandemic more than 1,000 people fled from North Korea to China every year, according to numbers released by the South Korean government.\n\nThe detention of the soldier presents a major foreign policy headache for US President Joe Biden.

President Emmanuel Macron said this was \"unjustifiable\".\n\nThe police officer who opened fire is now under formal investigation for voluntary homicide.\n\nNahel M was shot at point-blank range as he drove away from police.\n\nFrench prosecutors argue that the use of a firearm was not legally justified.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, President Macron held a crisis cabinet meeting to discuss the escalating riots.\n\nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said that France had witnessed \"a night of unbearable violence\".\n\nHe said \"the state must be firm in its response\", adding that 40,000 police officers would be mobilised across the country later in the day to prevent any further violence.\n\nOvernight, clashes were reported across suburbs of Paris - but some of the most violent confrontations were in Nanterre, where the teenager was shot dead.\n\nVideos shared on social media showed cars being set alight and shops being ransacked on Wednesday across the Paris region.\n\nA prison in Fresnes, south of the capital, was also attacked with fireworks by rioters overnight, AFP reported.\n\nThe news agency said videos showed about 20 young men attacking the entrance to the prison with fireworks and projectiles. Videos shared to social media showed an alarm sounding during the attack.\n\nThe violence was particularly concentrated around the Pablo Picasso district there, where young people took to the streets after the sun set.\n\n\"They're backing off! Let's go guys, let's go, death to cops!\" one yelled, while various cars and rubbish bins were set alight.\n\nWhile the violence was concentrated in that district, protesters targeted other regions across Paris, with many firing fireworks into police stations.\n\nIn the northern city of Lille, footage posted online showed people inside the town hall of the Mons-en-Bar\u0153ul suburb setting documents and chairs alight.\n\nAnd elsewhere, in the western town of Rennes, about 300 people gathered to pay tribute to the teen. Some of them also lit fires and were dispersed by police.\n\nOn Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the shooting of Nahel was \"unforgivable\".\n\nBut his comments drew an angry reaction from police unions, who accused him of rushing to judge the officers involved.\n\nThe Alliance Police union called for them to be presumed innocent until found guilty, while the rival Unit\u00e9 SGP Police also spoke of political interventions that encouraged \"anti-cop hatred\".\n\nMr Darmanin said he would be taking legal action against another group, France Police, after it published what he called an \"unacceptable and abject\" tweet seeking to justify the teenager's killing.\n\nThe now-deleted tweet said \"bravo\" to the officers who \"opened fire on a young criminal\" and blamed the teen's parents for his death, claiming they had been \"unable to educate their son\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel's mother Mounia, speaking in a social media video, said they had taken away her baby and urged people to join a march in remembrance of her son.\n\n\"He was still a child.

He was everything to me.\"\n\nThe officer accused of killing him, who said he had fired because he felt his life was in danger, is in custody on charges of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nNahel, who a neighbour says came from a French-Algerian family, is the second person this year in France to have been killed in a police shooting during a traffic stop. Last year, a record 13 people died in this way.\n\nRights groups have criticised a 2017 law change which broadened the framework for when officers can use firearms.\n\nCiting official statistics, Le Monde newspaper reported that the annual number of police shootings at moving vehicles has consistently been higher since the change.\n\nCampaigner Rokhaya Diallo told BFMTV that more shots fired meant a higher risk of being hit, especially for people of colour.\n\nReuters news agency found that a majority of victims of lethal police shootings during traffic stops since 2017 were black or Arab.\n\nFirefighters extinguish a burning vehicle in Nanterre following protests in the wake of Nahel's death\n\nAccording to French media, police initially suggested the teen drove his car towards them with the intention of hurting them.\n\nBut footage posted online and verified by the AFP news agency shows an officer pointing his weapon at the driver through his window and appearing to fire at point-blank range as he tries to drive off.\n\nThe agency also reports that a person in the video can be heard saying: \"You're going to be shot in the head\" - but it is unclear who says it.\n\nTwo others were in the car at the time of the shooting. One fled while another, also a minor, was arrested and held by police.\n\n\"Nothing justifies the death of a young person,\" President Macron told reporters in Marseille, calling for \"calm for justice to be done\".\n\n\"I would like to express the feelings of the entire nation at what has happened and the death of young Nahel, and to tell his family of our solidarity and the nation's affection.\"\n\n\"We have a teenager who has been killed. It's inexplicable, unforgivable,\" he said, adding that the the case was immediately referred to the courts where he hoped justice would \"do its job quickly\".\n\nAuthorities have opened two separate investigations following the teen's death - one into a possible killing by a public official, and another into the driver's failure to stop his vehicle and the alleged attempt to kill a police officer.", "For the first time, more than 2.5 million people in the UK are out of work because of a long-term health problem.

The reasons for this are complex, taking in everything from diet and smoking, to access to GPs, to the quality of local housing and green spaces.\n\nThe concern - from the Health Foundation and others - is the pandemic might have worsened some of these underlying health inequalities.\n\nBBC News analysis of the latest ONS data, up to June 2022, also reveals stark differences across the country.\n\nThe highest long-term sickness rates are in Northern Ireland, north-east England and Wales.\n\nBut in London, which has a younger population, the numbers have actually fallen 3% since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe largest rises were in the parts of the Midlands, south-east England and Wales.

And it said borrowing would rise as government spending on defence increased to meet \"growing security threats in Europe and Asia\".\n\nDecarbonising the economy to reach net zero by 2050 would also cost the government billions in extra spending, it said.\n\nAll of these factors could lead to the size of the UK's debt compared to the size of the economy - as measured by the debt-to-GDP ratio - tripling over the next 50 years, the OBR said. It added that unforeseen shocks or unfunded policies could drive it even higher.\n\nThe OBR added that the government's current plan for stabilising and then reducing debt - as a share of GDP by 2027-28 - was \"relatively modest by historical and international standards\".\n\nCommenting, Mr Hunt said the government would take \"difficult but responsible decisions on the public finances, including public sector pay, because more borrowing is itself inflationary\".\n\nBut Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the OBR's report showed \"just how far we are falling behind our peers\".\n\n\"There are serious decisions to be made by this Tory government to restore some security in our economy, to get a grip on inflation, and to stop people's bills rising.\"\n\nThe OBR's report also warned gas prices are expected to remain high until at least 2025.\n\nSoaring oil and gas prices have contributed to the rapid pace of general price rises, putting struggling households under pressure.\n\nAfter a massive 13-fold price jump in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gas prices have fallen back - but are still more than twice as expensive as before.\n\nThe OBR said the hike in gas prices had made renewable energy cheaper than gas over its life-time for the first time.\n\nHowever, despite this, it said there was \"little sign of a step-change in renewable energy investment in the UK\".\n\nPlanned UK government investments in green technologies will not get the country to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the OBR said.", "Paramedic Kevin Cornwell, 53, has been detained in Afghanistan\n\nTwo of the British men being held by the Taliban in Afghanistan have spoken to their families, a humanitarian group representing them has said.\n\nThe Presidium Network said Kevin Cornwell, 53, and another unnamed man were able to speak \"freely\" and that the calls had brought \"great relief\".\n\nA third man, named as Miles Routledge, 23, but not being represented by the group, is also being held.\n\nThe government has said it is \"in negotiations\" over the men.\n\nPresidium, a UK-based non-profit organisation that supports people in crisis, said the two men were able to speak for \"one minute to one minute and a half\" and described the call as a sign of \"tremendous progress in the situation\".\n\nReferring specifically to Mr Cornwell, it said: \"The relief Kevin's family expressed after hearing his voice for the first time in three months, not knowing if he was well, brought a great sense of peace and gave them hope that this situation will be resolved soon.\"\n\nMr Cornwell, a paramedic from Middlesbrough who works for a charity, and the unnamed man were detained on 11 January.\n\nScott Richards of Presidium said previously that there were \"no official charges as such\" but that the detention was understood to be over a weapon that had been in a safe in Mr Cornwell's room.\n\nHe said the weapon was being stored with a licence issued by the Afghan interior ministry but that the license was missing.\n\n\"We have taken several statements from witnesses who have seen the licence and affirm its existence,\" he said.\n\n\"It is perfectly possible that during the search the licence was separated from the weapon and, as such, why we refer to this scenario as a probable misunderstanding.\"\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Sunday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the government was \"in negotiations and working hard to ensure people's safety is upheld\".\n\n\"Anyone travelling to dangerous parts of the world should take the utmost caution.

So these things are all opportunities to learn and reflect.\"\n\n12 February - The Sunday Mail reports that the SNP has lost 30,000 members over the gender reform bill and a stalled independence referendum.\n\n14 February - The SNP describe the Sunday Mail's report as \"wholly inaccurate\", with party media chief Murray Foote describing it as \"drivel\".\n\n15 February - Nicola Sturgeon resigns as first minister and SNP leader, triggering a leadership contest.\n\n24 February - The candidates to replace Ms Sturgeon are confirmed as Ash Regan, Humza Yousaf and Kate Forbes.\n\n15 March - Ash Regan and Kate Forbescall for clarity on membership numbers in an open letter to SNP chief executive Peter Murrell.\n\n16 March - The SNP publishes its membership numbers, revealing it has about 72,000 members - 32,000 fewer than the 104,000 it had two years ago.\n\n17 March - SNP media chief Murray Foote resigns over the party's response to the Sunday Mail's story on party numbers.\n\n18 March - SNP chief executive Peter Murrell resigns, taking responsibility for misleading the media about membership numbers.\n\n27 March - New SNP leader due to be announced.\n\nEarlier Mr Russell told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland the three leadership candidates could have confidence in the contest.\n\nAll three have pledged to reform the SNP's operations.\n\nMs Sturgeon said it was important for the party not to \"throw the baby out with the bath water\" and lose things that have made them successful in the past.\n\nShe added: \"Perspective is important in these things. We don't know this for sure because other parties in Scotland don't tell us what their membership figures are but on the most recent assessments, even with that decline, the SNP has more members in Scotland than all of the other parties combined.\n\n\"We are the only mass membership party in the country.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon last appeared on Loose Women in April 2022 when she discussed her anxieties about going through menopause and coping with it while in a public role.\n\nOn Monday she spoke to the panel about having a miscarriage at the end of 2010 - and how she had not yet processed the experience.\n\nLast week the Scottish government announced a memorial book for those who experience pregnancy or baby loss prior to 24 weeks.\n\nNicola Sturgeon said looking at this picture, taken at a 2010 commemoration of the Ibrox disaster, people could see she was in \"a lot of pain\"\n\n\"These are the things that often get dismissed in politics as soft soap but I think they're really important because they go to the heart of the values you have as a country,\" Ms Sturgeon said.\n\n\"You can find a photograph of me at an event actually while I was still having a miscarriage at a public commemoration... Looking at that photograph now, it's clear that I'm in a lot of pain - and so how do you deal with it?\n\n\"I think back then if there had been some way of recognising it that would have brought a lot of comfort at a really difficult time.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'Hopefully more time to slob about the house after leaving office' - Nicola Sturgeon\n\nLooking towards her final days as first minister this week, Ms Sturgeon said she hopes to continue championing issues that are important to her.\n\nShe said she would not follow in the footsteps of Matt Hancock who took part in ITV's I'm A Celebrity reality show, adding: \"I can say categorically, definitely no Strictly, definitely no jungle.\n\nAsked \"What about Bake Off?\", she said: \"I can't cook or bake.\"\n\nOn the subject of her legacy, Ms Sturgeon said it is for others to decide - but she is most proud of policies like the Scottish Child Payment, the baby box scheme and the rise in young people from working class backgrounds attending university.\n\nShe said: \"These are the things I'm proudest of because I think in years to come, the impact of these kind of measures will be seen.\"", "Kyrees (L) and Harvey were best friends, their families said Image caption: Kyrees (L) and Harvey were best friends, their families said\n\nThe families of both boys who died in the crash - which sparked a riot in Cardiff on Monday - have said the pair were best friends.\n\nHarvey's family said he was \"a best friend to Kyrees, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family also\".\n\n\"He lived life to the full, he had a big heart and deep down he truly cared,\" Harvey's mum said.\n\nKyrees' family described him as \"a loving, caring handsome young man\".\n\nThe tribute from Kyrees' family added: \"He was loved so much by his grandparents and aunties and uncles and his many cousins.\n\n\"Him and Harvey, along with Niall, were best friends since they were young and went everywhere together, they both had so many friends and were very well liked doing many things together, having fun and laughs.\"", "K-pop star Karina has apologised to her fans after news of her dating actor Lee Jae-wook went public\n\nA K-pop star has issued a grovelling apology after incensed fans accused her of \"betrayal\" - because she has a boyfriend.\n\nThe fans reportedly drove a truck to pop star Karina's agency after finding out she was dating actor Lee Jae-wook.\n\n\"Is the love given to you by your fans not enough?\" an electronic billboard on the vehicle demanded.\n\nIn a letter shared on Instagram, the aespa frontwoman vowed \"to heal the wounds\" she had inflicted.\n\n\"I apologise for surprising you greatly,\" the 23-year-old wrote, promising to show a \"more mature and hardworking side\" in future. The singer, real name Yu Ji-min, has led the four-woman aespa since their debut in 2020, with the single Black Mamba. Last year, their record-breaking album My World sold 2.1m copies in South Korea.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, however. Pop stars in South Korea and Japan work in notoriously pressurising industries, where such personal revelations can be tricky to navigate.\n\nJust a decade ago, it was common practice for K-pop agencies to ban new stars from dating or even having a personal mobile phone, and even now admissions of romantic relationships were often considered scandalous to fans.\n\nLast August, BBC reported on how Blackpink's lead vocalist Jisoo's relationship with actor Ahn Bo-hyun rocked the K-pop world. Some experts told the BBC then that pop stars' agencies seek to sell them as \"romantically obtainable\" idols.\n\nIn Japan, many pop stars are bound by \"no dating\" clauses in their contracts, and getting married requires permission.\n\nThe news of Karina's relationship first broke on 27 February, with Karina and Lee, 25, later confirming the two had met last year. Lee's agency C-JeS Studio asked for \"warm respect... as this involves his private life\".\n\nBut some of Karina's fans drove to the headquarters of SM Entertainment, the company which formed and manages aespa. These trucks have become a common practice used by K-pop fans to show support or discontent in recent days.\n\n\"Is the love given to you by Karina fans not enough? Why did you choose to betray the fans? Please apologise directly. Otherwise, you will see a decrease in album sales and empty concert seats,\" one of those messages read.\n\nHowever, not everyone was unhappy about the relationship with Lee, who debuted in the drama Memories Of The Alhambra in 2018 and gained prominence after starring in the hit fantasy period drama Alchemy of Souls.\n\n\"You don't need to apologise for feeling. I will always root for your happiness.

Ukrainian forces are now reported to have set up positions on the eastern bank nearby.\n\nThe reporters had passed three checkpoints and the Ukrainian military had let them through \"without problem\", Zunino said in a telephone conversation with his newspaper.\n\nHe then heard a \"hiss\" and saw his colleague lifeless on the ground.\n\n\"We were hit. I saw Bogdan on the ground, he wasn't moving,\" he said\n\n\"I crawled until I got out of the line of fire. I ran until I came across a civilian's car. I was covered in blood. I tried several times to call Bogdan, he didn't answer.\"\n\nZunino is being treated in hospital in Kherson.\n\nBitik \"unfortunately did not make it\", the newspaper wrote, adding that he leaves behind his wife and a son.\n\n\"He was a great friend of mine, the pain is excruciating,\" Zunino said.\n\nThe newspaper said it was proving difficult to recover Bitik's body because of Russian snipers.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Italian media that the Russians were responsible for the killing.\n\n\"Russians don't care if you're Russian, Italian or Ukrainian, they just shoot,\" he said.\n\nBefore this death was announced, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said eight reporters had been killed and 19 injured in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion last year.\n\nCrossing the Dnipro river could be significant in future offensives. Ukraine's military has for some time publicly spoken about preparations for a major counter-offensive, without specifying where and when it could be launched.\n\nUntil now, all of the Kherson region on the east bank of the Dnipro has been under Russian control, with the wide river serving as a natural barrier.\n\u2022 None Ukraine sets up positions across river in Kherson", "Brothers Maksym (left) and Ivan (right) signed up to fight for Ukraine together after Russia launched its full-scale invasion\n\nMaksym had been fighting for 200 hours without a break when he was killed by a Russian sniper in the city of Bakhmut.\n\n\"For eight days he did not eat, or sleep,\" his mother Lilia says. \"He couldn't even close his eyes for five minutes because the sniper could shoot.\"\n\nThere's a reason why she now calls Bakhmut \"hell\". It's the city that took the life of one son and left her only other child seriously injured.\n\nHer one scant comfort - that one died saving the life of the other.\n\nMaksym and Ivan volunteered to fight when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. At the time Maksym was 22 years old and Ivan just 18.\n\nIvan, the younger brother who still carries the scars, says they were inseparable. \"He was always with me and I with him. For me, he was the dearest person.\"\n\nIvan shows me videos and photos of them together - in a trench, in a military vehicle, trying to get some rest.\n\nAs time passes, you see two smiling, handsome young men change, gradually appearing wearier as war strips away their innocence.\n\nThe two brothers were inseparable - fighting and resting together at the front\n\nTheir last moments together were spent engaged in brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut. \"It was impossible to sleep there. We were being attacked 24/7,\" Ivan says.\n\nThe brothers' unit was trapped in a windowless room of a building. They'd had to punch through walls to make firing positions. That's when they received an order to pull back.\n\nIvan recalls the moment before he was wounded. \"I remember I was reloading; I came out from behind a wall and there was a flash. I was paralysed and I fell.\"\n\nHe says he then felt the warmth of the blood flowing from his injuries to his face. He didn't think he'd survive. \"I thought I was done; I'll bleed out and that'll be it.\"\n\nBut Maksym came running to his rescue and dragged him back inside a building for cover.\n\n\"He revived me, took out my broken teeth and began to give me first aid,\" says Ivan. That included piercing a hole in Ivan's throat to prevent him from choking.\n\nIvan shares a video of his brother tenderly wiping the blood away soon after the explosion. Another widely shared clip shows Ivan struggling to walk with a gaping wound to his face, but still clutching his Ukrainian flag: a symbol of bravery and resistance in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nIvan has no doubts that he would have died if it weren't for Maksym's actions. \"My brother didn't let me die. He saved me.\"\n\nIvan (seen here recovering in hospital) had a hole cut in his throat by his brother to help him keep breathing\n\nMaksym urgently called on the radio for help. But the first medics that tried to reach him were all killed in their vehicle when it was struck by a Russian anti-tank missile. It took another nine hours before Ivan could be rescued.\n\nAnd then came Maksym's extraordinary act of self-sacrifice. Rather than travel with his brother to safety, he volunteered to stay in Bakhmut, to lead their unit.\n\nStill fighting there a week later, Maksym was killed by a Russian sniper.\n\nIn Ukraine the funerals of soldiers are now as constant as the sound of artillery on the front line. But they're not all like Maksym's. Alongside his grieving family, the entire town of Tomakivka had come out to pay their respects.\n\nThey knelt as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery - some clasping flowers or Ukraine's flag. The prayers and sombre music accompanied by tears and sobbing.\n\nSerhii (left) and Lilia were supported by the entire town at their older son's funeral\n\nFor the past year, Maksym and Ivan's parents had been living their sons' battles vicariously. Lilia and Serhii were having sleepless nights too - waiting anxiously to hear from their boys. They'd often receive a short text to reassure them, says Lilia - \"We're good, mum.\"\n\nBut then came the news they'd been dreading.\n\nLilia weeps over Maksym's coffin before it's finally lowered into the ground - accompanied by a volley of gunfire. \"We still can't believe it. My soul is torn,\" Lilia tells me after the funeral. She says her only reason to continue living is for her younger son.\n\nShe tells me Maksym had the chance to leave with Ivan, but he would not abandon their younger, less experienced comrades.\n\n\"He's a hero. He's an angel. He's sunshine. He would never leave his brother even though he knew he would die himself.\"\n\nUkraine won't say how many lives have been lost in this war. But look around the cemetery and you soon realise the entire country is paying an extremely heavy price.\n\nMy brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood\n\nAt this one small graveyard, in this one small town, there are rows and rows of freshly dug graves surrounded by flowers. Maksym's was one of three soldiers' funerals the local priest was conducting that week.\n\nFor Roman, who was once himself a soldier before taking holy orders, it was harder than most. He is a family friend and prayed with Maksym and Ivan's parents for the safe return of their boys, whom he knew.\n\n\"You often have to bury soldiers,\" said Roman. \"But not your friends.\"\n\nAt the funeral, Ivan is still clutching the Ukrainian flag which he carried when wounded - signed by his comrades including his brother. The blood from his own wounds staining the blue and yellow cloth.\n\nI ask him if he now regrets his decision to join the army. He replies: \"We understood that we might not return, but it's an honour to fight for Ukraine. That's why I don't regret it in any way.\n\n\"My brother gave his life for our freedom.

Detectives are watching 400,000 hours of footage in an attempt to find clues in the John Caldwell case, says Eamonn Corrigan\n\nAn estimated 400,000 hours of CCTV footage has been seized for analysis in the hunt for those involved in the shooting of a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) detective.\n\nThe investigation into who shot Det Ch Insp John Caldwell is one of Northern Ireland's biggest in recent times.\n\nHe was attacked in February by two gunmen as he coached youth football while off-duty in Omagh, County Tyrone.\n\nThe 48-year-old's young son was at his side when he was ambushed.\n\nThe CCTV footage has been obtained from 750 cameras located between Belfast and Omagh.\n\nPolice believe dissident republican group the New IRA may have acted with an organised crime gang to carry out the attack.\n\nDet Ch Insp Caldwell is in regular contact with the team investigating his shooting and there is an \"added determination\" to catch those responsible because he is a colleague.\n\nDet Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan, who is leading the attempted murder inquiry, said: \"We are lucky John didn't die.\n\n\"He is making a good recovery but it is going to be a long road.\"\n\nDet Ch Supt Corrigan said the wounded officer, who was discharged from hospital in April, has given investigators his account of the shooting.\n\nHe added the investigation had made \"significant progress\", but gave no further details.\n\nIt is an overwhelming amount of footage that has been seized - 16,000 days viewing if one person was to watch it from beginning to end.\n\nClearly the police have seized a lot more material than they may ultimately need because they want to have it before it is wiped or deleted.\n\nThe scale of the task is huge. What we can't really quantify is the scale of progress and whether or not they have had a significant breakthrough.\n\nI left the CCTV viewing suite with the overriding impression that this is a resource hungry investigation.\n\nIt is clearly going to take a long time to build a case or indeed cases given the number of people the PSNI believe were involved.\n\nTo date, 15 people have been arrested and there have been 40 searches of premises and land.\n\nMore than 340 witnesses have been interviewed so far.\n\nTwo Ford Fiesta cars used in the attack had been bought about 70 miles away, in Glengormley and Ballyclare, County Antrim, weeks prior to be used in the shooting.\n\nThey were found burned out following the attack.\n\nAttempting to trace their movements has meant obtaining footage from hundreds of cameras spread over a large area.\n\nThis car near a farmyard on the Racolpa Road outside Omagh is thought to have been used by the gunmen and was later burnt out\n\nDetectives are poring over the material in several viewing rooms within a Belfast police base.\n\n\"All the detectives working on the case know the importance of CCTV and the fact that a 15 or 20-second piece of footage could be crucial in building a case,\" said Det Ch Supt Corrigan.\n\n\"An attack of this nature is carried out by multiple people who are organised.\n\n\"We are looking for movements of people and vehicles over time. It is time consuming and a lot of patience is required,\" he added.\n\nThe New IRA has admitted responsibility for the attack, but police believe a crime gang may have aided it.\n\nDet Ch Insp Caldwell has run investigations into both paramilitary groups and organised crime gangs.\n\n\"Whether these people are members of a terrorist organisation or an organised crime organisation, this has been an attack on a serving police officer at the behest of the New IRA,\" Det Ch Supt Corrigan said.\n\n\"How they carry out their operations and support them logistically is not for me to decide.\n\n\"I will follow the evidence and bring people who are responsible before the courts.\"", "Ellie Varley, 25, said she believes everyone who works in Parliament has a story of sexual misconduct\n\nA \"predatory culture\" still exists around the House of Commons, with inappropriate flirting and sexual misconduct still prevalent, staff say.\n\nSix members of staff told BBC Newsnight that abuses of power by male MPs and senior staffers remained common, and a new complaints process was too slow.\n\nOne woman said she was asked to sit on a male MP's knee and she was bombarded with text messages by another person.\n\nA House of Commons spokesman said it took complaints \"extremely seriously\".\n\nThe spokesman said bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct had no place in Parliament, adding: \"We remain committed to ensuring that lasting cultural change can be achieved here.\"\n\nIt comes after damning allegations have been made about the behaviour of MPs in recent months, with several MPs suspended.\n\nThe parliamentary staff we spoke to said, despite a new complaints scheme, little has changed. All the allegations they made relate to the last two years.\n\nEllie Varley, 25, said everyone who works in Parliament either has their own story of sexual misconduct, or knows someone with one. She said the problem \"transcends party politics\".\n\nShe says she was asked to sit on a male MP's lap, in an incident that took place on the Parliamentary estate. \"He just kept saying just come sit on my lap. And I was like: 'I'm fine, thank you. I don't want to sit on your lap'.\"\n\nShe said the MP was so persistent she felt she had no choice, and reluctantly agreed to \"get him off my case\". The MP is one of a number to be suspended over separate allegations.\n\nShe said there was still a feeling among some MPs and senior staffers that they can do what they want without repercussions. \"There are big names in Westminster, and you kind of feel intimidated by them,\" she added.\n\nMs Varley, who works as a parliamentary aide to Tory MP, Dehenna Davison, said incidents can include a \"hand on the hip in a social setting\".\n\n\"I [often think] am I reading too much into this? Are you just being friendly or are you touching me because you think you can?\" she added.\n\n\"I've had it when people have texted me incessantly being like: 'Are you out tonight?' 'What are you doing?' And not getting the hint if I don't reply after you've messaged six times.\"\n\nShe said she was \"frankly just angry\" and claimed people in the palace do not feel safe to report issues: \"They don't have the trust in the system. I'm just fed up.\"\n\nThe six parliamentary staff said inappropriate touching and flirting was still a problem - with younger staff sometimes preyed upon by older MPs and staffers.\n\nEllie Varley: \"Every staffer will know someone who has experienced this\"\n\nFive of the people we spoke to currently work in the Commons, while one of them has recently left their role on the estate. The ex-staff member said she saw the same behaviour take place repeatedly.\n\n\"In the bars you'd still see male MPs all over staffers; in their physical space, buying them drinks and actually behaving in a pretty disgusting state - touching bums and putting their hands all over their lower backs. It's lecherous.\"\n\nShe added: \"You'd see male MPs openly ogle female staffers and comment to them about how they looked in an overly flirty sense or they'd talk among each other about who was fit or not.\" Some male MPs talked about female MPs in the same way, she added.\n\nIn 2018, Parliament set up the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), to investigate complaints about inappropriate behaviour, such as bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct, and to provide advice to complainants.\n\nSince then, complaints are investigated by independent investigators, commissioned by the ICGS team on a case-by-case basis. However, one senior official, who has worked in the Commons for several years, said the scheme had made no difference to what he described as a \"predatory culture\".\n\n\"I wouldn't recommend it [HoC] as a safe place for any young men or women. If a young person I knew really really wanted to work in the House of Commons, it would come with a whole list of warnings about how to stay safe, who not to hang out with, where not to go\", he said.\n\n\"The same things still go on as before #metoo,\" he said, referencing the global social media movement that saw people share stories of sexual abuse, harassment and rape.\n\nHe described the new complaints processes as \"useless\". \"Just ask anyone who has tried to use them\", he added.\n\nComplaints in Parliament are investigated by independent investigators\n\nOne of the criticisms of the ICGS is that investigations take too long.\n\nAccording to its last annual report, of the 21 completed investigations it carried out in 2021-2022, 12 were cases where an MP was a respondent. These cases took an average time of 262 days. By comparison, cases involving parliamentary staff took an average of 186 days, and MPs' staff cases, took an average of 133 days.\n\nA Commons spokesman said the complaints scheme was the first of its kind in any Parliament in the world. \"It has enabled, and will continue to enable, Parliament to identify and deal effectively with unacceptable behaviour,\" they added.\n\n\"However, though much has been achieved in the last five years, we know there is more work to be done.\"\n\nYet Ms Varley said she was \"disappointed\" so little has changed. She said \"too many people\" think reporting incidents is \"just not worth it\". \"It takes a long time and it can wear you down,\" she added.\n\n\"This is something that everyone will have a story of. Every staffer will know someone who has experienced this [sexual misconduct] and that's thousands of people who are employed here.\"\n\n\"I think it comes down to culture and you can't fix the culture overnight,\" she added. \"Until these people have repercussions for their actions, and until the victims have faith in the reporting process, I don't think anything's going to change.\"\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the ICGS said it \"is there to ensure that all complaints are dealt with in a manner that is fair, thorough, independent and efficient, offering support to all parties involved. The target to reduce the length of investigations must always be balanced against the paramount requirement to ensure that investigations are rigorous and robust.\n\n\"The ICGS always seeks to learn from every case, striving to deliver a compassionate and effective service that everyone in Parliament can be proud of, contributing to building a workplace where everyone feels safe and valued.\n\n\"The ICGS is here for every member of the parliamentary community - we urge anyone who needs it, to use it.\"", "The 666 bus - as seen in this promotional image from Poland's PKS Gdynia bus company - usually runs during the summer along the Baltic coast\n\nThe popular bus route 666 to Hel in northern Poland is being changed to 669, after long-running complaints by religious conservatives in the country.\n\nRoute 666 - used by those heading for sandy beaches in the resort of Hel - has become a bit of a joke for some, including English-speaking tourists.\n\nBut some religious conservatives claim the route is \"spreading Satanism\".\n\nThe Bible identifies 666 as the \"number of the beast\", and Hel is just one \"l\" short of the English word \"hell\".\n\nFollowing the complaints, bus company PKS Gdynia announced: \"We are turning the last 6 upside down!\"\n\nExplaining the reason for the change, the firm's designer Marcin Szwaczyk told the trojmiasto.pl news website the number 669 was \"less controversial\".\n\nWhile the association between 666 and the word \"hell\" may be lost on some Poles - as the Polish word for it is \"pieklo\" - a number of social media users in the country have condemned the coming change, which the bus company says is set to take place on 24 June.\n\n\"I have often read about route 666 to Hel on foreign websites or Facebook groups. I am convinced there were tourists who would have probably arrived faster by train, but for fun they took bus route 666.\"\n\n\"What is Hel without 666,\" quipped Dawid Jastrzebski, while Kamil Galczynski argued that this was \"a perfect example of how NOT to do marketing\".\n\nAnother social media user, Robert Eryk Wozniak, wrote: \"I think that the next step should be to change the name of the town of Hel to something else because it is against our Christian Polish roots!\"\n\nPoland is a predominantly Roman Catholic nation, where the Church has traditionally been influential.\n\nOver the past few years, religious conservatives from one Polish group have complained that bus company PKS Gdynia is \"spreading Satanism\".\n\nRoute 666 usually runs in the summer along the Baltic Sea coast. The region boasts miles of sandy beaches, and is a popular tourist destination.", "The Women's Tennis Association will resume tournaments in China this year having accepted an investigation into the sexual assault allegations made by former player Peng Shuai will not be carried out by the Chinese government.\n\nFormer doubles world number one Peng said in November 2021 she was \"forced\" into a sexual relationship with former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli.\n\nThe WTA suspended its end-of-year events in China and said it would not return until there was an investigation and it had proof of Peng's safety.\n\nAfter making the accusation in a social media post, Peng briefly disappeared from the public eye and she then later denied making the allegation. Zhang has not commented publicly on the allegation.\n\nThe WTA had called for the Chinese authorities to hold a \"full, fair and transparent\" investigation before any tournaments could go ahead.\n\n\"We've been in this for 16 months and we are convinced that at this point our requests will not be met,\" WTA chief executive Steve Simon told BBC Sport.\n\n\"To continue with the same strategy doesn't make sense and a different approach is needed. Hopefully, by returning, more progress can be made.\"\n\nThe decision means the final two months of the WTA season will once again be dominated by China. Simon said the schedule will be \"very similar\" to the pre-pandemic year of 2019 when eight Chinese tournaments were staged in eight weeks from early September.\n\nAnd crucially, the season-ending WTA Finals will resume its 10-year deal with the city of Shenzhen.

It's about leading an organisation and listening to its members,\" he said.\n\n\"We have athletes that come from over 80 nations, so there's plenty of different opinions, but the majority of athletes were very supportive of a return back to the region. We certainly have some that were not, but the majority - the great majority - were in support and are in support of going back. There was strong support across the members, the [player] council and the board.\"\n\nSimon says this change of heart was not forced upon them by commercial realities, but accepts members would have \"sacrificed a great deal\" had the WTA Tour withdrawn from China for good.\n\nThe WTA's boycott lasted just over 16 months, although no tournaments could have taken place in the country during that period anyway because of the Covid pandemic.\n\n\"We've achieved some assurances from people that are close to Peng that she's safe and living with her family in Beijing,\" Simon said when asked whether the WTA had achieved anything. He says he has not yet been able to speak personally with Peng.\n\n\"We do also have some assurances that there won't be any issues with our players and staff while they are competing in China. And hopefully we have received some respect for the stance we took,\" he continued.\n\n\"We haven't seen anyone else take a stance such as we did. There hasn't been any other sporting leagues or any business that have - we took that strong stance, we stand behind it.\"\n\nThe men's Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour committed itself to 2023 events in Chengdu, Zhuhai, Shanghai and Beijing once China's Covid regulations eased, and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said this month it is looking forward to bringing the World Tennis Tour back to China.\n\n\"We didn't go into this with expectations that anybody would [follow suit],\" Simon added.\n\n\"I would have liked to have seen that, for sure, but we didn't expect it and we're not pointing fingers at anyone else.\"\n\nSimon denies that by returning to China, the WTA has removed a crucial pillar of support for Peng.\n\n\"We are hoping by the return more progress will be made,\" he said. \"We are very proud of the position we took.\n\n\"We're not going to let Peng be forgotten at this point in time.\"\n\nKai Ong, a China researcher at Amnesty International, said: \"There's no independently-verifiable evidence that can prove Peng Shuai is truly safe and free.\n\n\"We're reminding the WTA of the structural hurdles many survivors of sexual violence in China face when seeking justice and remedy.\n\n\"Returning to China without continuing to push for an independent investigation into Peng's accusations risks perpetuating the systemic injustice faced by sexual violence survivors in the country.\"\n\nThe move was described as \"very important\" by French world number five Caroline Garcia, who said she understood the decision to return to China.\n\n\"The ATP and the ITF was already going back, and women's tennis is following,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"In the past we have had some huge tournaments over there and I think it is an important swing for us in our calendar and I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nFormer British number one Anne Keothavong, who captains the nation's Billie Jean King Cup team, and current British player Katie Boulter both stressed Peng's safety was their main concern.\n\nBut they added the future health of the WTA Tour - and the staging of more tournaments - had to be considered.\n\n\"From a tennis perspective, hopefully it will be a welcome return,\" said Keothavong.\n\n\"I don't know whether they have been able to investigate in the way that they would have liked, but tennis is a business. The WTA need to generate commercial revenue and the players need a circuit to compete.\"\n\nBoulter added: \"I think ultimately there's two things. One is that we hope Peng Shuai is OK and secondly it's just an excitement to have tournaments on the calendar.\n\n\"Sometimes I think we don't have enough tournaments and I really hope that we can get out there and enjoy it.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Knights and bishops took over a corner of Parliament as two grandmasters faced off for the first UK-Ukraine Solidarity Chess Match.\n\nMichael Adams, the UK's number one chess player took on reigning Ukrainian champion, Andrei Volokitin, in an eight-minute \"blitz\" game.\n\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle organised the game to champion Parliament's support for Ukraine as it fights an invasion by Russian forces.\n\nSir Lindsay made the ceremonial opening move - d2 to d4, the Queen's Pawn.

Enabling important cultural and sporting activities is another way of championing that,' he said.\n\n\"Chess is also a wonderful game of strategy that crosses boundaries of language, age, sex, culture and disability - which makes it the perfect sport for Grandmasters of two friendly nations, or even parliamentarians, to play.\"\n\nMr Adams and Mr Volokitin will now compete in best of eight games as part of the UK-Ukraine Solidarity Chess Match, which carries a \u00a338,000 prize.\n\nThe remaining games will be split between Ukrainian Embassy and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Canary Wharf.\n\nThe event was organised by organised by the charity Chess in Schools and Ms Reeves, a junior chess champion.

We're back to that phase of you can't hang around if you are looking at a fixed rate.\"\n\nHe said lenders were being forced to reprice deals as the market shifted around them and those with cheaper deals faced a \"tidal wave\" of business.\n\n\"Unfortunately I think this week we may still have to see more of that happening.\n\n\"But hopefully those rates will just start to find a level and we'll see things start to calm down in the near future.\"\n\nAccording to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage deal is 5.86%, while a five-year deal has hit 5.51%.\n\nLast May they were 3.03% and 3.17% respectively, meaning many households have seen sharp rises in their borrowing costs.\n\nWhen a fixed term comes to an end then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). But brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.\n\nIan Stuart, boss of HSBC in the UK, admitted it was a \"deeply concerning\" time for a lot of customers.\n\n\"If you've got an old rate, as many will have, let's say 1.5%, and you're going to come off that rate and go onto something like 5%, that is a big impact on your monthly budget.\"\n\nHe said the bank had been forced to pause sales of new deals last week as it was struggling to meet \"unprecedented\" demand.\n\nHe also said HSBC expected UK interest rates to rise further, putting more pressure on the market.\n\n\"So not the news mortgagees would be looking for, but I don't think inflation is going to fall quite as fast as we had hoped.\"\n\nRising mortgage rates are also putting pressure on landlords, pushing some to consider selling up, surveyors say.\n\nIn turn, that could further squeeze the availability of rental properties and raise costs for tenants, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.", "Mr Blackford faced four different Conservative prime ministers in their weekly question session in the House of Commons\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP's former Westminster leader, is to stand down as an MP at the next general election.\n\nMr Blackford has been the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber since 2015, when he defeated former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy in a controversial campaign.\n\nHe led the SNP's Westminster group for five years and faced four different Conservative prime ministers at question time in the Commons.\n\nThe former banker stepped down as group leader in December.\n\nThe resignation avoided Mr Blackford facing a possible challenge from his eventual successor, Stephen Flynn, amid speculation that some of his MPs were plotting to replace him.\n\nHe had become a well-known figure in the House of Commons through his weekly appearance at Prime Minister's Questions and was seen as being a close ally of Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister and SNP leader who stood down earlier this year.\n\nBut he angered some members of the party's Westminster group by urging them to give \"absolute full support\" to SNP MP Patrick Grady, who had been suspended for sexual misconduct.\n\nMr Blackford said he had thought \"long and hard\" whether to stand in next year's general election and that he was \"privileged and humbled that people across my home constituency have put their trust in me at three elections\".\n\nHe added: \"Having stood down as SNP Westminster leader, I have gone through a period of reflection as to how I can best assist the party and the cause of independence - a cause I have campaigned for since joining the SNP as a teenager in the 1970s.\n\n\"My desire to see Scotland become an independent country, and for our country and its people to achieve its full potential, remains as strong as when I first entered politics decades ago.\n\n\"Although I will not be standing for the Westminster Parliament at the next election, I look forward to playing my part in the continuing campaign for Scottish independence and supporting our first minister and the SNP as we go forward to the next election and beyond.\"\n\nMr Blackford has been working on producing a paper on Scotland's industrial future, which he said he hoped would lead to \"sustainable enhancement in economic growth, driving investment and better paid jobs in Scotland and raising living standards\".\n\nHe added: \"I look forward to finishing this work and continuing as the first minister's business ambassador, on behalf of the SNP.\"\n\nMr Flynn, the SNP's current group leader at Westminster, said his predecessor had played a \"massive role\" in making the party a formidable force in Scottish and UK politics.\n\nHe said Mr Blackford had been a \"stalwart in the SNP for decades\", adding: \"I know Ian will be sorely missed by his constituents and colleagues when he stands down as an MP but I am confident that he will have a key role in continuing the campaign for Scotland to become an independent country.\"\n\nMr Blackford's campaign to replace Mr Kennedy as the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber in 2015 became mired in controversy over online abuse aimed at the former Liberal Democrat leader and his long-running battle with alcoholism.\n\nBrian Smith, who was convenor of the local SNP branch, later resigned after it was reported that he had called Mr Kennedy a \"drunken slob\" and \"quisling-in-chief\" in a series of more than 130 tweets.\n\nMr Kennedy died of a major haemorrhage linked to his alcoholism just three weeks after the election.", "For many people this is the start of the great summer getaway as schools across England and Wales begin their six-week holidays.\n\nBut last year's summer season was marked by widespread travel disruption.\n\nSo whether you're travelling by plane, train, road or ferry, will things be smoother this time round?\n\nThis summer is set to be the busiest time for aviation since before the pandemic.\n\nSome 92,404 flights are scheduled to depart the UK this July, according to aviation data firm Cirium - the most since October 2019.\n\nLast summer, demand for travel roared back after Covid travel restrictions were eased. But many airports and airlines that had made cuts during the pandemic struggled to recruit staff quickly enough.\n\nThey insist they've pulled out all the stops to make their operations more resilient this year.\n\nFor example, EasyJet told the BBC in March it started recruiting far earlier than usual and was already fully staffed for summer.\n\nHowever, there are different headaches this year, which could mean further disruption, although not necessarily on the scale of last year's problems.\n\nStrike action, notably by French air traffic controllers, has been causing cancellations and delays for months.\n\nFlights over France to destinations such as Spain and Portugal have also been affected, which Ryanair's boss has repeatedly complained about.\n\nHowever, some action has been called off. Eight days of strikes planned in July and August by ground handlers at Gatwick Airport will now not go ahead.\n\nMany airports struggled to cope last summer\n\nProposed summer strike action by security workers at Heathrow was called off after the Unite union accepted an improved pay offer.\n\nAnd at Birmingham Airport, a strike expected to involve more than 150 security staff and technicians has been suspended after a fresh pay offer.\n\nThe threat of strikes by European air traffic managers at Eurocontrol remains, but no dates have been set. The union involved told the BBC it hopes to reach an agreement with the employer.\n\nThe air traffic control environment is \"challenging\", according to Willie Walsh, who heads up global airline body Iata.\n\nEasyJet has already axed 1,700 summer flights at Gatwick to reduce the chance of last-minute cancellations, blaming what it called \"unprecedented\" air traffic limitations.\n\nEurope's air space remains constrained and clogged up due to the Ukraine war.\n\n\"In the event of French strikes some flights may be rerouted through other, already congested, air space which itself creates additional pressure,\" says aviation expert John Strickland.\n\n\"Manpower shortages in parts of Europe such as Greece and Denmark [are] causing capacity bottlenecks, which create further delays.\n\n\"Indeed one European airline CEO told me that the whole of European air traffic control except the UK was 'a mess'.\"\n\nMr Strickland thinks events like summer storms could add pressure to an already stretched system, leading to delays and cancellations.\n\nOn the railway, the plans of thousands of people going on day trips or holidays could be affected.\n\nRail workers in the RMT union at 14 train companies with government contracts walk out again on Saturday 29 July.\n\nTheir dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions has been going on for more than a year now.\n\nThe operators are all based in England but some run services into Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe level of disruption during these strikes will vary around the country. Many will run reduced services.\n\nStrike day timetables are published a week before each date.\n\nIt's worth checking before you set off.\n\nThese RMT strikes are happening after the union rejected the latest proposals from the industry, which is backed by the government.\n\nThe train companies are under pressure from the government to cut costs. With the national dispute at a standstill, they have since announced controversial plans to close most station ticket offices in England.\n\nPassengers are being asked to provide their views until 26 July, in a consultation run by watchdogs Transport Focus and London Travelwatch.\n\nTrain drivers in the Aslef union have also been taking action short of a strike in the form of an overtime ban at 15 train companies. The next overtime ban will be from Monday 31 July to Saturday 5 August.\n\nThis could cause some reduced timetables and last-minute cancellations.\n\nIn London, strikes on the Underground have been called off following last-minute talks.\n\nTraffic is expected to increase as we head into the summer holiday season, and roads could be busier than usual as train strikes push people into cars instead.\n\n\"It's likely that people will consider altering their journey plans and they may well travel by car instead so it's important they check their vehicle is roadworthy before setting off,\" says Frank Bird, senior network planner at National Highways.\n\n\"We'd also remind motorists to check the weather forecast... and to take plenty of drinking water with them as well as food that won't be affected by the heat in case of delays.\"\n\nThere were long queues at Dover during the Easter holidays\n\nDover is Europe's busiest ferry port, and summer is its peak time as passengers head across the Channel.\n\nIt will be under the spotlight again after many passengers experienced long queues last July and during this year's Easter holidays.\n\nHolidaymakers are being warned to expect to wait up to two-and-a-half hours to pass additional passport checks introduced after Brexit.\n\nIn late May, port boss Doug Bannister told the BBC everything possible had been done to prevent the same level of delays.\n\nHowever, he said \"it would be foolish\" to guarantee there would never be queues. Mr Bannister added that additional passport checks were a factor.\n\nThe port's location between cliffs and the sea means space is limited.\n\nIt says measures in place ahead of the summer holidays include working with coach and ferry operators to spread out travel at peak times, extra space to process coach passengers, and putting in more border control posts.\n\nLocal authorities and emergency services have traffic management plans for busy times, including queuing up lorries on the M20 motorway.\n\nThis system was reinstated ahead of the busy July and August period.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The BBC's media editor Katie Razzall looks at why Prince Harry is suing the Mirror Group\n\nPrince Harry has been on this collision course for years - and finally he is going to be in a courtroom in person, eyeball to eyeball, in his battle against the tabloid press.\n\nIt promises to be an electrifying moment as he gives his evidence and faces questions from lawyers in London's High Court about his allegations of phone hacking.\n\nPrince Harry has said that changing the media landscape is his \"life's work\" - and this gladiatorial courtroom encounter could be one of his own defining moments.\n\nHe has two of the key requirements for this legal battle: First, a single-minded determination to keep going without settling, and second, being rich enough to take the financial hit if he loses.\n\nBut giving evidence in person in this Mirror Group Newspapers hacking trial will have big risks for him. He will face the type of open, public and tough questioning that is a long way from any previous royal interview he has taken part in.\n\n\"This isn't like taking questions from Oprah Winfrey in a celebrity interview,\" says Tim Maltin, managing partner of Maltin PR, which specialises in high-profile reputation management.\n\n\"It is a hostile encounter with a highly-skilled cross-examiner armed with a battery of techniques to undermine your credibility.\n\n\"Giving evidence is daunting\u2026 and cross-examination is far more often traumatic than cathartic,\" he says.\n\nPrince Harry is likely to face detailed questioning about highly personal news stories which he claims were obtained through unlawful means - an allegation which the newspaper group disputes.\n\nHe could face gruelling questioning about stories relating to his relationships, his girlfriends, his mother Diana, the treatment of Meghan and his life growing up in the Royal Family.\n\nThere have already been challenges to the allegations of Prince Harry and his co-complainants. Lawyers for Mirror Group have said the evidence of hacking is \"slim\" in some cases and \"utterly non-existent\" in others.\n\nPrince Harry in 2010 with Chelsy Davy, a relationship he says was undermined by press intrusion\n\nPrince Harry's own memoir, Spare, might be turned against him, with its accounts of drug taking and family tensions.\n\nHistorian and author Sir Anthony Seldon thinks Prince Harry is ill-advised to be appearing in court like this.\n\n\"Harry should never be there,\" he says, arguing that the Royal Family should rise above such fights.\n\n\"Harry's standing and trajectory will only be harmed, whatever the outcome. The public is losing sympathy with him and his constant protestations of victimhood,\" says Sir Anthony.\n\n\"Harry and Meghan's continuing hard luck stories only make William and Kate look much better in every way,\" he adds.\n\nBut royal commentator Pauline Maclaran thinks taking a stand like this could boost Prince Harry's popularity, particularly among young people.\n\nRather than being accused of being privileged or entitled, she says in this court case \"he'll be seen as the underdog, and that's a good position to be seen in\".\n\n\"Many young people will see him as quite a heroic figure, fighting the establishment,\" says Prof Maclaran, an academic at Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\n\"It could be good for Harry in the long run, even though the older generation will be tut-tutting,\" she says.\n\nAs for the rest of the Royal Family, they will be \"watching with an element of horror\", she says.\n\nA previous hacking case this year against News Group Newspapers already produced the bombshell claim that Prince William had reached a private settlement with the newspaper publishers.\n\nAnd Prof Maclaran expects more focus on the Royal Family's dealings with the press in a way that could prove \"uncomfortable\" for Harry's royal relatives.\n\nThe Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew in 2019 only lasted an hour - but it is still providing material for news four years later. So it is not surprising if there is royal anxiety about Prince Harry facing days of giving evidence.\n\nThere is going to be intense global interest in this court case. Harry and his wife Meghan provoke strong reactions among supporters and critics, and the eyes of the world will be watching.\n\nRoyal historian Ed Owens says the public will be fascinated by this combination of \"courtroom drama and royal soap opera\" and the prospect of a royal \"pulling back the curtain\" on the relationship between the tabloid press and the monarchy.\n\nNot only does this case aim to expose evidence of hacking, but the stakes are made even higher by the argument that senior executives must also have known what was going on.\n\nHow will Harry react when his claims are challenged and put under the microscope? Will he start getting irritated? Will it be upsetting for him to talk about the press intrusion which by his own account has dogged him since childhood? How will he handle the pressure?\n\nEdward VII (left) is one of small group of royals who have given evidence in court - in the 1890s as Prince of Wales. He is pictured with Victoria and George V\n\nIt is very unusual to see a royal appearance in a witness box.\n\nThe last senior royal to give evidence in this way was in the 19th Century, when Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, appeared in two cases - one in a dispute over card cheating and the other in a divorce case, in which the prince denied any \"improper familiarity\".\n\nIn 2002, Princess Anne appeared in court to plead guilty after her dogs bit two children.\n\nBut those were very brief and different types of court appearances.\n\nPart of the mystique of the monarchy is in saying little and answering less. Prince Harry is breaking the unspoken taboo about a royal going into the witness box to face what could be very embarrassing questions - but it is something that he clearly feels is worth the risk.\n\nHis grievance with the excesses of the press is deeply personal and emotional.\n\nThis is a court confrontation that you could almost trace directly back to the death of his mother Diana, in a car crash in Paris in 1997 when she was being pursued by paparazzi.\n\nHe has repeatedly connected that moment to his battle with the tabloid press.\n\nIt is his day of reckoning.

But critics have argued the move will amplify disinformation as Twitter Blue subscribers will get prioritised rankings - Mr Musk has said that only verified accounts will appear in the site's prominent For You stream.\n\nSocial media monitors and experts fear the rise in paid verification will lead to an amplification of misinformation on the site. If that were to happen, it could scare off yet more advertisers - and undermine any extra revenue Twitter is getting from its verification subscription model.\n\nBut Mr Musk said pain is a part of change.\n\n\"I feel like we're headed to a good place,\" he told BBC News. \"Overall, I think the trend is very good.\"", "President Macron was re-elected on a platform of raising the retirement age and yet his reforms are deeply unpopular\n\n\"What this crisis goes to show,\" veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel said recently, \"is that there are two Frances out there. They live in completely separate mental worlds, and find it impossible even to communicate.\"\n\nAs the country teeters on the edge of civil unrest, his verdict echoes like a gloomy premonition. France's demons are back, and stalking the land.\n\nThe anger and mutual incomprehension over President Emmanuel Macron's proposed reform of the pension age show how dangerously polarised the two factions have become.\n\nThe government says pushing back the pension age from 62 to 64 is vital in order to preserve France's much-prized \"share-out\" system - based on a single fund that workers pay into and pensioners draw out of.\n\nWith people living longer, the only alternatives would be to cut the value of pensions, or increase contributions from those in work.\n\nAnd both those options would be even more unpopular.\n\nWhat's more, says the president, France is merely aligning itself with every other European democracy - most of which have pension ages even higher than the proposed 64.\n\nBut none of this seems to have gained traction with the public, who continue to reject the reform by a margin of about 70% to 30%.\n\nPrime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne addressed the National Assembly last week to a chorus of boos and chants of \"Resign\"\n\nInstead, people seem more inclined to believe the arguments of the left and far-right: first that there is no urgency because pension finances are not as bad as they're portrayed - but also that it's unjust.\n\nOn one side, many protesters are calling not just for an end to the reform, but actually for a lowering of the retirement age, back to where it was before 2010, when it was just 60.\n\nOn the other, voices from the right say that the Macron plan is already so riddled with concessions and exemptions, wrung under pressure during the long parliamentary process, that the savings it will make are now virtually meaningless.\n\nIn a functioning democracy the opposing arguments would surely find some form of compromise. After all, a majority of the population, while rejecting the Macron plan, also agrees that some reform of pensions is needed.\n\nFaith in conventional politics and the parliamentary system is in fact at rock-bottom. How else to explain the collapse of Gaullists and Socialists, who ran France for half a century, and the rise of the far-right and far-left?\n\nPresident Macron encouraged the death of the ancien r\u00e9gime, that old order which he exploited to pose as the lone moderate, picking sensible bits from programmes of left and right.\n\nPresident Macron's failure to secure a parliamentary majority in last year's election means he will struggle to enact major reforms\n\nHyper-intelligent and hyper-keen he may have been, but France never liked him and he was elected, twice, by default. Because the alternative, Marine Le Pen, was unacceptable to most.\n\nBy eliminating the moderate opposition, he made the opposition extreme.\n\nAt last year's parliamentary election, he failed to secure a majority - making inevitable the use last Thursday of constitutional force majeure known as 49:3 to push the law through.\n\nMeanwhile, the tenor of public debate was steadily debased.\n\nThe left tabled literally thousands of amendments to the pensions bill, making its conventional passage impossible. Opponents described as \"brutal\" and \"inhuman\" a reform which in other countries would have seemed perfectly anodyne.\n\nOne left-wing MP posed outside the Assembly with his foot on a ball painted with the head of the labour minister; fearing mob violence, a leading pro-Macron MP called on Friday for police protection for her colleagues.\n\nThousands of tonnes of rubbish lie uncollected in Paris as refuse collectors strike for a second week\n\nWith scenes of looting and urban violence, hills of rotting rubbish on the streets of Paris and other French cities, and the promise of more crippling strikes to come, this is the unedifying atmosphere as the country enters the next crucial phase in the crisis.\n\nFollowing the president's invocation of the 49:3 procedure, opposition parties have tabled two censure motions against the government which will be debated this week. In theory, if one of them passes that would lead to the fall of the government, and possible early elections.\n\nIn practice, even the so-called \"transpartisan\" motion tabled by a centrist group in parliament - supposedly more liable to create a consensus between the mutually hostile far-left and far-right - would be unlikely to get the numbers.\n\nIf the motions fail, then the opposition can continue to battle the reform by other means: for example by appealing to the Constitutional Council, which rules on the constitutionality of new laws, or by trying to organise a referendum.\n\nThe government hopes that reality will at some point set in, and that most people will dejectedly accept the inevitable.\n\nQuite possibly a sacrificial victim will eventually have to made - no doubt in the form of Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne.\n\nBut for now, the mood is too ugly for that.\n\nIn the immediate term, to every petrol depot blockaded, to every bin uncollected, and to every window smashed will be joined the accompanying refrain: \"Blame 49:3.

You score a goal in a 2-0 win against your Midlands rivals having just played 70 minutes for England against Brazil and 90 against Belgium at Wembley.\n\nKonsa is back thriving in an Aston Villa shirt after a lengthy lay-off through injury. He also looked comfortable in the Three Lions defence and may be one of the surprise call-ups in May for the European Championship.\n\nIn the win over Wolves Konsa looked self-assured. To have him back in defence for Villa's remaining eight games must be a big relief for Unai Emery.\n\nTo keep a clean sheet against Wolves and not concede on set plays having struggled in previous games is not a coincidence - Konsa will have had plenty to do with that.\n\nWilliam Saliba (Arsenal): I don't think I've seen a more disciplined or professional defensive performance from an Arsenal team for years. No dramas from Granit Xhaka or incidents that were likely to enrage the home support.\n\nThe Gunners finished the 0-0 draw with Manchester City with 11 players on the pitch, having not lost their heads or forgotten the mission. Hey presto, they come away from Etihad Stadium with a point to keep the pressure right on Liverpool and remain serious title contenders.\n\nSaliba goes through games almost unnoticed until you realise very little has actually got past him. This time last year he got injured and missed the most crucial part of the season and Arsenal paid the price. If the Gunners can keep their players fit they are in with a real chance. It is still all to play for.\n\nGabriel (Arsenal): I thought about selecting Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk but then Jarell Quansah equipped himself exceptionally well under the circumstances against Brighton and so did Joe Gomez.\n\nHowever, I felt compelled to pick Gabriel, who handled Manchester City's Erling Haaland brilliantly. They locked horns on a couple of occasions while there was a moment when the camera actually picked up the red-hot level of intensity between the two players.\n\nGabriel is a warrior, there is no doubt about that, and he completely outbattled Haaland. Over the years Arsenal have taken away the rough edges associated with Gabriel's game without losing any of his competitive edge and he is now proving to be a real asset.\n\nA clean sheet away at the Etihad is telling. If they do go on and lift the title their defensive displays will have an awful lot to do with it.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): I've seen some poor decisions in my time but the penalty awarded to Chelsea for the apparent foul on Mykhailo Mudryk by Burnley's Lorenz Assignon was about as farcical as it gets.\n\nDarren England's assessment of the situation was appalling. He awarded a penalty to a player whose first touch was so poor he sent the ball in the direction of the defender - who then inevitably made shoulder contact with the striker. Not every bit of contact in the box has to be a penalty. The issue is whether it is a foul or not.\n\nFor England to seriously consider the contact on Mudryk a penalty was laughable. However, having sent Assignon off for a second yellow he should have at least sought confirmation from the touchline monitor which is now available to referees - but he did not. It is hardly surprising Burnley boss Vincent Kompany completely lost it on the side of the pitch.\n\nThe way Palmer dispatched his penalty showed he has supreme confidence in his own ability. But his dinked finish was bordering on 'taking the Michael' and players have a way of dealing with that. If he's not careful he may have his wings clipped.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): The ball by Mac Allister for Mohamed Salah to score Liverpool's winner in the 2-1 victory against Brighton was nothing short of world class.\n\nThe Argentine midfielder did something similar for Darwin Nunez to snatch a last-gasp win against Nottingham Forest earlier in the season so there is no doubt about his quality. It is never easy playing against your old team-mates but Mac Allister did not let the occasion get to him and produced some sparkling football.\n\nBrighton were outstanding in this match. Any team that receives warm applause from an Anfield crowd at various periods of the game says volumes about the quality of their away performance.\n\nMuch has been made about the decision of Xabi Alonso to remain at Bayer Leverkusen, but Liverpool could do much worse than offer Roberto de Zerbi the post. What he has done at Brighton is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nAnthony Gordon (Newcastle): It's been one hell of a week for Gordon. He played for England against Brazil in midweek only to return to the North East to preside over the thrilling 4-3 comeback win over West Ham at St James' Park and get sent off in the process. His second yellow card was his only mistake throughout the entire match against the Hammers.\n\nBut why Vladimir Coufal felt the need to try to win a ball in his own box he didn't need to and give away a penalty during the first three minutes of the game takes some explaining.\n\nGordon was smart enough to know that if he got to the ball first the defender would clatter into him and so he did. Newcastle lived dangerously but West Ham were reckless to lose a two-goal lead when looking so comfortable.\n\nHarvey Barnes (Newcastle): West Ham haven't kept a clean sheet in nine matches and it is hardly surprising the way they defended against Newcastle. Kalvin Phillips remains off the pace and needs a good pre-season and a series of top-class uninterrupted fixtures to get him back to where he once was.\n\nMeanwhile, Harvey Barnes looks every bit rejuvenated and back in business having come on for the Magpies and scored two brilliantly taken goals - and he could have had a hat-trick within 30 minutes.\n\nBoth these players have suffered recently for various reasons but have the ability to get back playing international football. Phillips would do well to get signed and settled permanently at West Ham as soon as possible, while Barnes needs to remain fit for the rest of the season.\n\nLuis Diaz (Liverpool): Colombia winger Diaz leaves every ounce of himself on the pitch. His work ethic is outstanding and it was his effort and determination that eventually wore Brighton's defence down and got Liverpool back into the game with his equaliser.\n\nHe deserves the goals he gets due to the fact that he works so hard for them. Liverpool find themselves back at the top of the Premier League table with nine games left to play and with Arsenal and Manchester City breathing down their necks.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side have a tricky run-in including a trip to Manchester United next weekend, who have already knocked them out of the FA Cup. Denying Liverpool three points at Old Trafford as they hunt a 20th title would have United fans licking their lips.\n\nIvan Toney (Brentford): He was desperately unlucky to have been ruled offside in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United, having taken the goal so brilliantly. However, to remain so calm when you are a goal down with seconds left on the clock to play says a lot about a player.\n\nToney controlled a hopeful ball that had come out of the sky with his foot like a ball sitting on a cushion. He then proceeded to dribble his way around a number of United players before laying the most exquisite pass on a plate for Kristoffer Ajer to finish what was a deserved equaliser.\n\nToney has been quite remarkable since his return from a suspension for gambling breaches that was in my view draconian and unsympathetic of a player who clearly had issues - and in a sport obsessed with gambling advertising.\n\nSon Heung-min (Tottenham): After their diabolical performance against Fulham before the international break we saw Tottenham make very hard work of a game against Luton that should have been routine.\n\nWhat happened to the team that blew Aston Villa away? And why Tottenham have to wait to go a goal behind before they realise the game has started is hard to fathom.\n\nWhat is infuriating is Tottenham's levels of inconsistency. One minute they look world beaters, the next perennial losers. Fortunately the only consistent player for Spurs these days is Son Heung-min. Without him they would be sunk.\n\nAll eyes start to shift to 28 April where Tottenham fans will be desperate to see their team stop Arsenal from winning the title. Something an inconsistent Tottenham are very capable of doing.\n\nThe Crooks of the Matter\n\nWhat a mess. The recent four-point deduction given to Nottingham Forest for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules seriously threatens their top-flight survival.\n\nThey now join Everton - who were docked 10 points earlier in the season for similar offences, prior to being given four points back on appeal - in a perilous situation at the bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, it is more than a year since Manchester City were charged with more than 100 alleged breaches of financial rules - which they deny - but it's business as usual for them. I think football fans deserve to know why.\n\nWhat is even more interesting is if Nottingham Forest or Everton do go down why should the players of either club suffer the financial loss or status? They have done nothing wrong. I would be consulting my lawyers and considering leaving the club with my registration in hand.\n\nThe Premier League, in trying to ensure fair play, seem to have done the opposite. They have created a legal battlefield and left certain clubs completely exposed having opened a hornets' nest. What's more it is the players and their fans who are the ones getting stung.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment", "Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been charged with gross negligence manslaughter after remains of a baby were found in an area of woodland.\n\nThe body of a newborn was found on Wednesday following a massive search operation around Brighton.\n\nProsecutors said they are also accused of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice.\n\nMs Marten, 35, and Gordon, 48, are due to appear at Crawley Magistrates' Court on Friday.\n\nThey were first arrested on Monday and held in custody for questioning, before being charged by the Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday evening.\n\nPolice said earlier on Thursday it was \"too early\" to say when the infant died or establish its sex.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said a post-mortem examination would take place on Friday.\n\nBarry Hughes, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London North, said: \"These charges arise from their arrest on Monday as a result of a lengthy police investigation to establish their whereabouts and that of their baby.\n\n\"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Constance Marten and Mark Gordon are active and that they have the right to a fair trial.\"\n\nMs Marten and Gordon were detained following a 53-day missing persons search which led to a wooded area in East Sussex.\n\nHundreds of officers using sniffer dogs, thermal cameras, helicopters and drones were drafted in to look for the infant.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because the baby died during a missing persons investigation it was leading.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given through monthly payments from October to March.\n\nHowever, for those with non-conventional energy set-ups the government launched the \u00a3400 Energy Bill Support Scheme Alternative Funding earlier this year.\n\nBBC Verify analysis of data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero shows that of the more than 200,000 applications made under the scheme:\n\nMatt Cole from the charity, the Fuel Bank Foundation, said it was disappointing that so many people had missed out and believed it was down to a number of factors.\n\n\"The launch of the scheme in spring this year rather before winter when it was needed most, the reliance on families self-identifying that they were eligible rather than them automatically receiving it, and the somewhat complex process to claim help will all have contributed.\"\n\nThe government said it had spent more than \u00a350m \"supporting 130,000 households without a domestic energy supplier\".\n\nThis data suggests just over \u00a3300m of the possible \u00a3360m in Great Britain had not been claimed before the deadline.\n\nPeople who thought they were eligible needed to apply on the government website or call a helpline, which is what Mark, who lives on his narrowboat, did.\n\n\"A lot of people [on canal boats] tried to put an application through for claiming for it [but] we hit a barrier when it said: 'Do you live in a marina or are you off grid?'\n\n\"The minute you clicked 'off grid' you went through to a box that said 'you are not eligible at this time'.\"\n\nMark uses three and a half bags of coal for his multi-fuel stove each week in winter. He had been paying around \u00a39 per bag but last winter the price nearly doubled.\n\n\"[The \u00a3400 payment] would've been a great help. That money's had to come from somewhere so it's had to come out of the rest of my budgeting or my savings.\n\n\"It would've made my winter a bit easier, maybe I could have spent a bit more money on the grandkids.\"\n\nCarol says she had to fight for her payment after being rejected several times\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.\n\n\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.\n\n\"We are urging councils to process applications and complete final checks as quickly as possible to ensure all those eligible receive the support they need.\"\n\nThe government said anyone who did not apply before the deadline should visit its Help for Households page.\n\nCarol lives on a park home site south east of Runcorn. She says the application process was simple, but she was forced to apply three or four times because she kept getting rejected.\n\n\"We got refused, I don't know how many times. I kept going, I wouldn't give up. Because I thought, 'Why should I give up?' I've worked all my life, I've paid into the system.\n\n\"[The \u00a3400] was very important because 99.9% of people on these sites are all retired and a lot of them only have a basic pension, or maybe a bit of a top-up pension.\n\n\"But it's not going very far because food's gone up, petrol's gone up, so the \u00a3400 was absolutely a godsend.\"\n\nPark homes were the largest single group seeking the \u00a3400 support, with 47,400 households out of the 203,580 who applied.\n\nTenants in private accommodation had the highest rejection and cancellation rates, with 47% of applications from this group being stopped. Applications were rejected if people had already received support, made a duplicate application or were not eligible.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics estimated that about 137,000 care home residents in England pay for some or all of their care, and these were eligible to apply for the support.\n\nThere were just under 22,000 applications from households in care homes across Great Britain.\n\nIn a similar scheme for Northern Ireland, 28,000 households were eligible for \u00a3600 worth of support, totalling around \u00a316.8m.\n\nThere were just over 8,000 applications in Northern Ireland from those without a domestic electricity supply, with just over 4,000 already paid by 1 June 2023 and 160 awaiting payment.\n\nOf the rest, just over 2,700 were cancelled or rejected and just over 1,000 were still being worked on. This means almost 23,000 Northern Ireland households may have missed out on an estimated \u00a313.6m.\n\nYou can hear more on this story on the Money Box podcast.\n\nHere are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips:", "Six people, three of them children, have been killed in a primary school shooting in Nashville.

Sir Keir Starmer on by-election win: Starmer: \"First time I have been able to say: Well done Keir\"\n\nSir Keir Starmer says Labour can now win anywhere - but Rishi Sunak insists his party is still in the game after three very different by-elections.\n\nLabour secured a massive 23.7% swing from the Tories in Selby, with its 25-year-old candidate Keir Mather winning by 4,000 votes.\n\nThe Lib Dems overturned a big Tory majority to take Somerset and Frome.\n\nBut in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the Tories narrowly held on to Boris Johnson's old seat.\n\nThe Labour leadership blamed their failure to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip by 495 votes on the planned expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez)- a charge for the most polluting vehicles - to outer London.\n\nThe winning Conservative candidate, Steve Tuckwell, said Sadiq Khan's \"damaging and costly Ulez policy\" had lost Labour the seat.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said Labour's Mayor of London needed to \"reflect\" on the policy, but stopped short of saying it should be scrapped.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak also attributed the Conservative win to voter anger over Ulez - and claimed the result showed the next general election was not a \"done deal\".\n\nMr Sunak said: \"When people are confronted with a real choice, a choice on a matter of substance, they vote Conservative.\n\n\"That's what the general election is going to be about.\"\n\nBut overall, the trio of by-election results show what the opinion polls have suggested for months - Mr Sunak faces a deep challenge at that election, which is expected to take place next year.\n\nHaving three by-elections on the same night is unusual, especially for a prime minister less than a year into the job.\n\nThe last time Labour secured a by-election swing as large as it did in Selby and Ainsty was in the 1990s - which ended with the Conservatives suffering a landslide defeat.\n\nKeir Mather, 25, is the first MP to be born after Labour's victory in 1997.\n\nHe will also become the youngest MP in the House of Commons after overturning a 20,000 Conservative majority.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It was the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nIn a statement shared by We The Fest, a music festival in Indonesia's capital Jakarta where The 1975 were scheduled to perform on Sunday, the band said current circumstances made it \"impossible to proceed with the scheduled shows\".\n\nSome of Malaysia's LGBT community were frustrated by events on Friday and worried the spotlight on their community could lead to more stigma and discrimination.\n\nOn Friday, on stage in Kuala Lumpur, lead singer Healy said: \"I don't see the [expletive] point, right, I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.\n\n\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued.\n\n\"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"\n\nHealy then kissed his bandmate MacDonald as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.\n\nShortly after the kiss Healy and the band walked off stage, roughly 30 minutes into the set. The singer told the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the festival's organisers announced that the remaining line-up for the festival had been cancelled.\n\nThe decision was made after an \"immediate cancellation directive\" from Malaysia's Ministry of Communications and Digital as part of its \"unwavering stance against any parties that challenge, ridicule or contravene Malaysian laws\", a statement said.\n\nMalaysian drag queen Carmen Rose said Healy's attack on anti-LGBT laws was \"performative\" and \"unruly\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour, Rose said: \"It is giving white saviour complex and he [Matty Healy] wasn't doing it for our community.\"\n\n\"If he was doing it for our community,\" she added, \"he would know what consequences we would have to go through.\"\n\nAs state elections in Malaysia loom ahead, Rose said politicians would use the event as a \"scapegoat\".\n\n\"It gives them [conservative politicians] more ammo to further their homophobic agenda to gain votes,\" she added.\n\nAsked about life in Malaysia as part of the LGBT community, Rose said \"the government is not on our side\" and she cannot pursue her profession as a drag artist freely in the country - travelling to Singapore for performances instead.\n\nRose said the LGBT community's mental health had been badly affected by constant scrutiny and criticism from the government and society.\n\n\"Matty has a long-time record of advocating for the LGBTQ+ community and the band wanted to stand up for their LGBTQ+ fans and community,\" a source close to The 1975 said Friday night.\n\nHealy has previously used appearances on stage to highlight anti-LGBT laws.\n\nBack in 2019, he invited a male fan on stage during a gig in Dubai. The incident attracted criticism in the country, where homosexuality is punishable by 10 years' imprisonment.\n\nPosting on Twitter after the show, Healy said: \"Thank you Dubai, you were so amazing.

Bids for freedom could be blocked on multiple occasions up until the end of a sentence.\n\nMr Raab previously told MPs that public protection would be the \"exclusive focus\" of the Parole Board decision-making process under the reforms.\n\nThe changes are in an effort to \"stop a balancing exercise taking into account prisoners' rights\", the Ministry of Justice said.\n\nMr Raab said: \"Our reforms will improve the experience for victims from the first meeting with a police officer to the support they get in court, and we will refocus the parole system on its overriding duty to protect the public from violent and sexual criminals.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that the Parole Board did not like the changes, but he said he wanted to take the parole process in \"a different direction\" with the emphasis on public safety.\n\nThose serving whole-life orders will be banned from marrying behind bars. These plans also follow an attempt by serial killer Levi Bellfield to marry in prison, and reportedly making a bid for legal aid to challenge the decision to block his marriage.\n\nThe 54-year-old is serving two whole-life orders for killing 13-year-old Milly Dowler, Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange, as well as the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy.\n\nLabour said it had been eight years since the Conservatives first promised this bill, \"and now they've had to combine it with parole reform\".\n\n\"Yet again, the Tories overpromise and underdeliver,\" said Labour's shadow victims minister Anna McMorrin.\n\n\"Victims are now waiting years for a trial because of record court backlogs, with criminals getting off scot-free at a record rate. Rape victims are suffering on average for three years as they wait to hear their case in court.\"\n\nDiana Fawcett, chief executive at Victim Support, said the charity welcomed many of the measures in the bill \"which will make a real and meaningful difference to the experience of victims\".\n\n\"But we are seriously worried that expanding its scope to include prisoners will be a distraction and delay it even further.\"\n\nThe End Violence Against Women Coalition said women and girls' confidence in justice agencies was at an all-time low because of their \"persistent failures towards victims and survivors of rape, sexual violence and domestic abuse\", and said it was concerned the bill \"will not transform victims' experiences without significant changes\".\n\nIt said there was a \"glaring absence of funding\" in the bill and said it was concerned it was \"creeping away from its intended aim of improving victims' experiences\".\n\nDirector Andrea Simon said: \"Recovery is an essential part of justice, and we need to ensure every survivor who needs help can access specialist support that is tailored to their needs\" - but added matters were a \"long way from that being a reality\".\n\nA Parole Board spokesman said: \"Public protection has always been, and will always be, at the heart of Parole Board decision-making, which is based on the evidence and the law.\n\n\"We are committed to working with the ministry and Parliament to ensure this important legislation receives the consideration that it richly deserves.\"", "A South African woman has described working as a fruit picker on farms in the south of England as \"slave labour\".\n\n\"We weren't viewed as humans,\" Sybil Msezane told a House of Lords committee.\n\nShe said workers were addressed by numbers, rather than names, as if they were in prison, forced to work 18 hour days and live in overcrowded caravans.\n\nIf they complained to bosses they were threatened with deportation, the Lords horticultural committee was told.\n\nThe committee is investigating the treatment of migrant workers on British farms.\n\nAndrey Okhrimenko, from Kazakhstan, speaking via video link, said: \"If you don't work fast enough, if you don't comply with quality... they will say 'we will cancel your visa, we can send you back home to your country'.\n\n\"We had extremely bad living conditions, we had problems with working conditions. We were disrespected and manipulated.\"\n\nLike Ms Msezane, he was recruited last year by an agent in his home country via an advertisement on social media, and had to pay for his own airfare and visa before being put to work on fruit farms in the south of England.\n\nMs Msezane, who is from Johannesburg, is now a care worker for an English local authority.\n\nShe told the BBC she was treated with respect in her new role, in sharp contrast to her experience last year as a seasonal agricultural worker, picking and packing strawberries for British supermarkets.\n\n\"I could not have thought that the conditions I found in 2022, in the United Kingdom, were what I found. It was beyond shocking.\n\n\"I'd spent close to, almost, \u00a32,500 equivalent. There is no way I am going home at that point. I am here to make money. That's essentially it. So you get to work.\"\n\nShe had to pay rent to live in a caravan with six people of different nationalities, both men and women, who had a single shower and fridge between them.\n\n\"My country is going through a lot economically. People need work. So I would never say to people not to come on the seasonal worker visa,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"Everyone who was on the scheme with me was able to support their families in different ways.\"\n\nBut she added: \"You need to be aware that you are coming into a country where you don't have as many rights as a worker as you do in South Africa. So that can be challenging.\"\n\nVadim Sardov, from Kazakhstan, said conditions on his farm were so bad several people had decided to leave and work illegally instead.\n\nSeasonal workers were not asking for \"five star hotels\", he told the committee, but \"employers must provide proper living and working conditions\".\n\nEmiliano Mellino, a journalist for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, who has written a series of articles on the treatment of migrant workers, told the Lords committee some workers had been subjected to bullying and abuse.\n\nHe said many take out loans to cover the costs of coming to the UK, and they also had to pay rent of up to \u00a380 a week for their accommodation, which meant they were reluctant to speak out for fear of losing their job.\n\nThe government's official policy is to train British workers to fill the 50,000 seasonal jobs on British farms currently carried out by migrant workers.\n\nBefore the UK left EU, most of these casual workers came from Europe.\n\nWhen the current seasonal workers visa scheme was launched in 2019, it had a quota of just 2,500 places a year, with most coming from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIt was expanded to 38,000 visas in 2022, following pressure from the farming industry, who had been forced to leave crops unpicked.\n\nThe net was cast to a wider range of nationalities, including South Africa and central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.\n\nThe scheme is due to run until 2024, with debate raging in government over whether it should be expanded to keep food costs down and help tame inflation.\n\nThe government has authorised only a small number of recruitment companies, known as \"scheme operators\", to arrange seasonal worker visas.\n\nFarmers must hire their overseas workers through those companies and must demonstrate that they are actively trying to recruit UK-based workers as well.\n\nScheme operators also have explicit duties to look after workers' welfare and make sure they are paid properly.\n\nAt an earlier committee hearing, in April this year, farmer Mike Newey said it was a \"myth\" that seasonal fruit picking was a low skilled, poorly paid job with bad accommodation.\n\n\"Our seasonal workers are paid a minimum of \u00a310.42, the national living wage, and often earn \u00a315 to \u00a320 an hour when they are on piece-work rates. It is good pay. They have subsidised accommodation on the farm.\"\n\nHe added: \"We should be proud of giving people from other countries a leg up. That is what we are doing.\"\n\nAli Capper, of the West Sussex Growers' Association, said: \"To have staff, we need to accommodate them, and ensure their welfare and that they are very well looked after.\"", "The French interior minister has asked regions to ban the sale of fireworks, petrol cans and flammable products\n\nCome to Nanterre to get an all-round view of the crisis boiling over in France. But if you are a journalist, be advised to keep your head down.\n\nAn approach to a group of young men - some bearded, one built like a bodybuilder - outside the Le 35 caf\u00e9 prompts an aggressive outburst of swearing and a pointed finger directing me to keep out.\n\nAt the scene where police shot dead a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent last Tuesday, women in Islamic headscarves shout abuse at police and the media from passing cars.\n\nWandering through the streets incognito - without a camera or notebook - past burned-out cars and smashed premises it is possible to pick up glimpses of the last catastrophic few days.\n\nThree middle-aged white ladies, Lucille, Marie and Jeanne, are chatting with a black male friend on a bench outside their block of flats. The area is pristine, surrounded by gardens - like many other apartment blocks in Nanterre.\n\nThey don't want to be photographed as they fear their children would be identified and targeted as a result, but they are happy to chat.\n\nPeople living in Nanterre have endured several nights of violence, looting and rioting\n\n\"The last three nights have been appalling. Between midnight and 4am it is bedlam outside our windows. No-one can sleep. I feel like I'm living on another planet,\" says Lucille.\n\nDo they perhaps not feel the anger from the rioters is understandable, when one of Nanterre's young residents, Nahel, has been shot dead at a police check?\n\n\"This rioting has nothing to do with what happened. Of course, the kid shouldn't have been killed. But what was he doing joyriding without a licence at eight o'clock in the morning, when children are going to school?\"\n\nMarie looks at a smashed bus-shelter daubed with graffiti that reads \"one cop, one bullet\".\n\n\"You see what it says there? That I am completely against. I don't think the police are racist. There are good and bad in every group of people,\" she says.\n\nThey have little time for the dead teenager's mother, Mounia, who took part in a mass march in memory of Nahel on Thursday.\n\n\"What was she doing up on that open-top van in the march? It was undignified. That wasn't a march of grief. She's playing politics.\" The others nod in agreement.\n\nPublic buildings like this tax office have been singled out for attack in Nanterre and across France\n\nNot far away on the Avenue Georges Clemenceau, lined with plane trees, the pr\u00e9fet who heads the Hauts-de-Seine department has come to survey the wreckage that was the front of the local tax office. \"Deplorable, lamentable,\" he says.\n\nFirework rockets fired by rioters at the building have left gaping holes in upper-floor windows. At street level, every pane has been smashed with a heavy instrument. Charred tax forms are scattered outside the entrance.\n\nAmong the onlookers is tax inspector Cyril, who lives in Nanterre but also declines to be photographed.\n\n\"What I feel is just wretched sadness,\" he says. \"This tax office serves the people of Nanterre. The money that comes from here is used to buy them services. What on earth is the point of attacking it? It's a totally disproportionate response.\"\n\nCyril, however, says he is broadly sympathetic with people who want to protest against Tuesday's killing.\n\n\"I'm not sure if racist police is correct. Let's just say they have an attitude. The kids around here have all had rough treatment, often because they were doing something stupid, sure.\n\n\"But look, this was a kid,\" says Cyril. \"The officer was an adult. He had a gun. It was his job to be in control of the situation. And he wasn't.\"\n\nThe local Nike store in Nanterre was trashed as rioting escalated on Thursday night\n\nThere are far stronger views, of course, among locals who took part in the memorial march.\n\nLike Bakari, who doesn't justify the riots but believes they are understandable: \"Certain people react against violence with violence.\"\n\n\"I wasn't surprised by [Nahel's killing] because we have all had bad experiences with police. There are good and bad everywhere, but the large majority of police are racist.\"\n\nOr Yasmina: \"I absolutely hate the French police. I wish them the worst. The whole system is corrupted by a systemic, racist ideology.\n\n\"[Nahel] could have been my kid brother. It blows my mind to think that a kid like that can make some stupid mistake, like anyone could do. He didn't deserve to die.\"\n\nThe town of Nanterre is far from the hellhole of isolated social deprivation some would like to depict. It is spacious, clean and two stops on the commuter train from the Arc de Triomphe in the centre of Paris.\n\nThe towers of La D\u00e9fense business district are a stone's throw away.\n\nThere is a theatre, a university, the national opera dance school, and a large park named after former President Charles de Gaulle's culture minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Unfortunately, yesterday the children's roundabout that has stood there for the last 50 years was burned down.\n\nThe over-riding impression one takes away of the town is of two universes colliding.\n\nOn one level, all the standard accoutrements of the generous French state are plain to see.\n\nTricolours fly; the pr\u00e9fet comes to survey his domain; Metro trains whizz underground and, in the looming towers of La D\u00e9fense multinationals make their billions.\n\nParis-Match photographer Eric Hadj says social media has helped the rioters mobilise\n\nBut in the same geographic space, there is another way of being: one which appears utterly alienated from the system; which is quick to see and reflect hostility; which says \"ici on est chez nous\" - this patch is ours - and gives the finger to unwanted outsiders, like the press.\n\nAt a petrol station by the tax office, veteran Paris-Match photographer Eric Hadj is surveying his smashed-up car and preparing forms for the insurance claim.\n\n\"We were here on Thursday during the march. Some big guys came and told us to get out. They made it quite clear we risked something very nasty if we didn't. When we came back today, of course the car had been totally wrecked.\"\n\nHadj has been through a lot of riots in his time but says he has never seen anything like this.\n\n\"This is worse, far worse than 2005,\" he says.\n\nEveryone here is looking back to the last sustained rioting that shook the French banlieues or suburbs for three weeks, wondering how long the latest unrest will last.\n\n\"Today there is social media, which gives the rioters a big advantage. But, above all, it is more violent. They have rockets.

He recognised unionists' difficulties, he recognised republicans' difficulties - he was able to assure them that he understood their challenges, but he was behind them.\"\n\nA unionist negotiator, Lord Empey, was more circumspect about Mr Clinton's role during the final hours.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party peer said: \"I don't think it made any difference to the minutiae or the outworkings of the agreement.\"\n\nHe thinks Mr Clinton's most significant contribution came over a longer period of time.\n\n\"President Clinton changed the atmosphere, so that America was no longer seen as totally supportive of Irish nationalism.\n\n\"No matter what his personal opinions may have been, he made an effort to treat us equally to others - we were no longer shut out.\"\n\nLord Empey said Mr Clinton \"changed the atmosphere\" by treating negotiators equally\n\nMr Clinton was the first president to appoint a US special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe political influence of some has been obvious - notably George Mitchell, the former Senate Majority leader who was appointed chair of the Good Friday Agreement talks by the British and Irish governments.\n\nIn more recent years, envoys have been seen as having significant roles in generating investment in Northern Ireland by US business.\n\nThe present holder of the post, Joe Kennedy III, has the official title of Special Envoy for Economic Affairs.\n\nHe will be staying on in Northern Ireland for an extended visit after Mr Biden leaves, to tour various locations in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt is on this leg of the trip that the president will meet his cousins the Finnegans in County Louth and the Blewitts in County Mayo.\n\nThese events may be more politically valuable to him in the US than his one engagement in Northern Ireland, given the power-sharing paralysis at Stormont.\n\nA previous US Special Envoy, one-time Democratic presidential contender Senator Gary Hart, told me in 2013 that his country remained \"disproportionately interested\" in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile there is some disappointment that Mr Biden won't be staying in Northern Ireland for long, most politicians, business leaders and civic groups make the point that to have a presidential visit at all is a boon.\n\nDeclan Harvey and Tara Mills explore the text of the Good Friday Agreement, scrutinising the deal's wording and hearing from some of the people who helped get it across the line.\n\nClick here to listen on BBC Sounds.", "Reaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillance\n\nA Russian fighter jet has collided with a US drone, causing the unmanned US aircraft to crash into the Black Sea, the American military says.\n\nThe incident highlights the increasing risk of direct confrontation between Russia and the US over the Ukraine war.\n\nThe US says the drone was on a routine mission in international airspace when two Russian jets tried to intercept it.\n\nRussia said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and denied that the two aircraft made direct contact.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry also said the MQ-9 Reaper drone was flying with its transponders turned off.

But if this was a deliberate attack on a US aircraft by a Russian warplane, then that would amount to a huge provocation and a substantial escalation.\n\nIn that case, the attack would be seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to test the response of the United States.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWestern allies have worked hard to stop the war in Ukraine escalating into a direct confrontation with Russia.

She's dead.\n\n\"We argued and she locked the door and said she wanted me out.\n\n\"All I wanted to do was take my stuff and leave. I just shut her up.\n\n\"I strangled her, I ran downstairs, and I cut her throat to make sure she was dead.\"\n\nThe court heard the couple had an Amazon Alexa, which can control household electrical items when activated by a voice prompt.\n\nDetectives discovered voice commands made by White and his wife at the time of the murder had been saved.\n\nProsecutor William Hughes said: \"Police have been able to discover that at 3.03am Angie in her bedroom said, 'Alexa, volume three'.\n\n\"At 3.16am Daniel White's voice can be heard saying, 'Alexa stop'.\n\n\"He then goes back downstairs into the living room and says, 'Turn on - Alexa' but what can also be heard is that he is out of breath and these appear to be the moments when, the Crown say, he has gone to get the knife.\n\n\"He then returns to the bedroom at 3.18am when he says 'Alexa, turn on the electric light', and at 3.19am he says, 'Alexa, turn off the TV'.\n\n\"So, the Crown's reasonable interpretation is after 3.03am and before 3.16am Daniel White had burst through the door and initially strangled Angie, then went downstairs to get the knife, and thereafter cut her throat.\"\n\nThe court heard the couple had begun arguing on WhatsApp. The last message they exchanged was at 03:11.\n\nA pathologist found Mrs White died from knife wounds to her neck. But there was also evidence she had been strangled.\n\nMrs White's family said nothing would be able to bring her back\n\nWhite previously admitted murder but refused to attend court for sentencing.\n\nDefence barrister Peter Rouch said the marriage was effectively over and what happened was \"a spontaneous act of violence\".\n\nHe said: \"I am not suggesting that is justification, but Your Honour has asked what led to it, and it would seem by putting the picture together as best one can, from the messages and the timings, that seems (to be) what has taken place.\"\n\n\"He does not have the courage to face the family and friends of the woman whose life he so brutally ended,\" he said.\n\n\"You have a disgraceful history of assaulting women who have had the great misfortune to be in a relationship with you.\"\n\nHe said: \"When you entered the bedroom you strangled her, probably rendering her unconscious.\n\n\"When she was face to face with you, with your hands around her throat, she must have been absolutely terrified.\n\n\"After she probably lost consciousness, you didn't seek help for her, you went downstairs and got a knife.\n\n\"You took it into her bedroom in order to kill her, to finish her off.\"\n\nThe judge said he had a \"cowardly desire to dominate her\".\n\nHe added: \"You did just that - you savagely slit her throat knowing that would kill her.\"\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Mrs White's family said: \"Angie was a much-loved daughter, sister, mother, grandmother, and auntie.\n\n\"Nothing can bring our beloved Angie back. We shall miss that silly giggle for evermore.\n\n\"Daniel White admitted his guilt but continued to use his manipulative behaviour to delay the outcome.\n\n\"He deliberately absences himself in what we see as his continuing attempts to control this situation and his cowardliness in avoiding facing us and justice for what he did to Angie.\"\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said a review was underway.\n\n\"This was a horrific crime and our sympathies are with the family and friends of Angie White. As with all serious further offences a review is now underway and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage,\" he said.\n\n\"Serious further offences are rare but we are investing \u00a3155m more every year into the Probation Service to improve the supervision of offenders and recruit thousands more staff to keep the public safe.\"", "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nTennis great Boris Becker says he is building his life's \"third chapter\" following his release from prison.\n\nThe 55-year-old German served eight months of his two-and-a-half-year sentence for hiding \u00a32.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts.\n\nHe was released in December and was subsequently deported from the UK.\n\n\"I'm usually good in the fifth set - I've won the first two sets, I've lost the next two and I'm planning to win that,\" he told 5 Live Breakfast.\n\nIn a lengthy interview, former world number one Becker said:\n\u2022 None There was \"no handbook\" for dealing with fame and fortune after winning Wimbledon as a teenager\n\u2022 None Prison was \"brutal\" and a \"very different experience to what you see in the movies\"\n\u2022 None He's a \"stronger, better man\" after eight months in prison\n\nThe full interview will be played on Saturday's 5 Live Breakfast show.\n\n'Whoever says prison life isn't hard is lying'\n\nThe six-time Grand Slam singles champion, who was catapulted to stardom in 1985 when he won Wimbledon aged just 17, was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act in April last year.\n\nThe case centred on Becker's bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than \u00a33m on his luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain.\n\nSpeaking before the release of a new TV documentary about his life and career, 'Boom! Boom! The World vs Boris Becker', Becker said: \"I don't think there was a handbook written for how to behave, what to do and how to live your life when you win Wimbledon at 17.\n\n\"The fame and fortune after was very new.\n\n\"Obviously I never studied business, I never studied finance and after my tennis career I made a couple of decisions probably badly advised but again it was my decision.\"\n\nAfter sentencing, Becker spent the first weeks of his detention at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, before spending the majority of his sentence at Huntercombe Prison in Oxfordshire.\n\n\"Whoever says that prison life isn't hard and isn't difficult I think is lying,\" the three-time Wimbledon champion said.\n\n\"I was surrounded by murderers, by drug dealers, by rapists, by people smugglers, by dangerous criminals.\n\n\"You fight every day for survival. Quickly you have to surround yourself with the tough boys, as I would call it, because you need protection.\"\n\nBecker said being a legendary tennis player counted for nothing while he was in prison.\n\n\"If you think you're better than everybody else then you lose,\" he said.\n\n\"Inside it doesn't matter that I was a tennis player, the only currency we have inside is our character and our personality. That's it, you have nothing else.\n\n\"You don't have any friends at first, you're literally on your own and that's the hard part, you have to really dig inside yourself about your qualities and your strengths but also your weaknesses.\"\n\nFollowing his release, Becker was deported to Germany and will not be allowed to return to UK soil until October 2024.\n\n\"I miss London, I really miss Wimbledon and I won't be going there this year,\" he said\n\n\"I'm fortunate that I can stand on my feet, none of my partners have dropped me, they've welcomed me back home.\n\n\"When you're down, and the last five, six years were very difficult for me, you truly find out who's with you and who's not with you.\"\n\nSpeaking about how he has been received by people since his release, he said: \"Nobody's perfect including myself and I've accepted all of that.\n\n\"I've been out now for three and a half months and I'm very humbled again by the reception I've received from fans, from people on the street from people who have followed the story a little bit.\"\n\nThe former BBC pundit says he has been in dialogue with the BBC about being part of its Wimbledon coverage in the future.\n\n\"I've told them I can't come back next year,\" Becker said.\n\n\"If I'm allowed to go back I will make a phone call and ask if they want me back on the team, I would certainly love to but it's not my decision.\"\n\nBecker believes he has learned valuable lessons from his time in prison.\n\n\"I never thought at 17 I'd be incarcerated at 54,\" he said.\n\n\"If anything it certainly humbled me, it certainly made me realise that whether you're called Boris Becker or Paul Smith, if you break the law, you get convicted and you get incarcerated, that goes for everybody.\n\n\"I never expected the good and I certainly didn't expect the bad but I'm a survivor, I'm a tough cookie, I've taken the penalties, I've taken the incarceration but I've also taken the glory and if anything this made me a stronger, better man.\n\n\"With my decisions in the future you can see whether I have learned from it or I didn't.\"", "A poster on a bus shelter in Moscow encourages young men to join up for a \"real cause\"\n\nRussia is raising the maximum age at which men can be conscripted from 27 to 30, making more of them liable to serve in the armed forces.\n\nThe change was passed by the lower house of parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThe package of measures comes as Moscow seeks to boost troop numbers to defend territory gained in its invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nA senior Russian MP said the new law was written with a major conflict in mind.\n\n\"It already smells like a big war,\" Andrei Kartapolov, head of the Russian parliament's defence committee, told MPs.\n\nHe argued that too many people were currently able to avoid military service.\n\nAll men of conscription age are expected to serve a year of compulsory military service.\n\nRussia is thought to have sustained heavy casualties in nearly a year-and-a-half of fighting, but the Defence Ministry is reluctant to release figures.\n\nLast autumn, the government announced a mobilisation of 300,000 reservists, but as a result, tens of thousands of men left Russia.\n\nIn a separate measure last week, the maximum age at which reservists can be called up was raised, meaning some men will now be considered available for military service until they are 55.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe State Duma passed the conscription bill in its second and third readings. It still needs to approved by the upper house and by President Vladimir Putin, but this is seen as a formality.\n\nOnce signed, it is due to come into force on 1 January next year.\n\nThe latest measures go further than the Defence Ministry's original proposal, which sought to change the conscription age range from 18-27 to 21-30. The lower age limit will continue to be 18.\n\n\"The wording of the draft law changed because the demographic situation is serious and affects the volume of the mobilisation resource,\" Mr Kartapolov told Russian media.\n\nHe added that \"many lads want to go and serve at 18\".\n\nThe draft law also bans men from leaving the country from the day of their call-up. Since April, conscription papers can be issued online instead of in person.\n\nIn addition, men who fail to report for conscription will be liable for fines of up to 30,000 roubles ($332), a tenfold increase.", "There is no longer any hope of locating survivors from a military helicopter crash, Australia's defence minister says.\n\nA significant amount of wreckage was recovered, pointing to a \"catastrophic incident\", Richard Marles told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe crash happened during a multinational military exercise off Lindeman Island on Friday night.\n\nAustralia's army chief had grounded a fleet of military helicopters after the crash, which left four crew members missing, and now feared dead.\n\nLt Gen Simon Stuart said none of the army's 45 MRH-90 Taipan helicopters - the craft involved in the accident - would be flown again until they were found to be safe.\n\nAustralia has previously grounded its Taipans for safety reasons.\n\n\"We are not flying the MRH-90 today and won't until we think it is safe to do so,\" Gen Stuart told reporters in Sydney on Sunday.\n\nFriday's crash happened at about 22:30 local time (12:30 GMT) over the Whitsundays, a group of islands off the coast of Queensland.\n\nThe missing soldiers onboard the aircraft were identified by the army as Capt Danniel Lyon, Lt Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class Two Joseph Laycock and Cpl Alexander Naggs.\n\nAll of them belonged to the Sixth Aviation Regiment, based in Sydney.\n\nThe helicopter went down during drills as part of Exercise Talisman Sabre, the massive training exercise which gathers 30,000 military personnel from Australia, the United States, and several other nations.\n\nCanberra had announced before the crash that it would be replacing its European-made Taipan helicopters with US-made Black Hawks.\n\nOfficials had complained about having to repeatedly ground the fleet for maintenance and safety issues.\n\nAs recently as March, the fleet was pulled from the skies after an engine failure in one of the helicopters during a training exercise, forcing the crew to ditch into the sea off the coast of New South Wales.\n\nThere were no casualties in the March training exercise. The other MRH-90s were returned to operations on 6 April with \"risk mitigations\".\n\nGen Stuart said the current aim was to keep the Taipans in service until 2024 but \"what happens between now and then, from what we learn from this incident, is yet to be determined\".\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the recent crash as a stark reminder \"that there are no safe or easy days for those who serve in our country's name\".\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in the northern city of Townsville, said the US would provide any assistance it could.", "Patients are being urged to shop around on the NHS app and website to cut their waiting time for treatment in England.\n\nIT systems have been updated to allow patients to more easily exercise their right to choose where they go for planned care, such as knee operations.\n\nThey will now be able to view up to five providers - filtered by distance, waiting times and quality of care.\n\nBut hospitals warned staffing shortages still needed to be tackled to make the biggest impact on waits.\n\nThe idea of choosing where to go for treatment has been in place since the early 2000s, but few use it.\n\nCurrently only one in 10 exercises their right to choose, with patients reporting they are not always offered a choice of where to go or that it is hard to select different venues.\n\nMinisters believe that by searching the list of different hospitals, patients will be able to reduce their waits - potentially by up to three months, research suggests.\n\nA letter has also been sent to local NHS managers reminding them of the need to offer patients a choice.\n\nMore than 7.3 million people are on the waiting list at the moment - nearly three million more than before the pandemic.\n\nOne in 20 has been waiting more than a year - although the NHS has got close to eliminating waits of more than 18 months.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"Empowering patients to choose where they receive treatment will help cut waiting lists - one of my five key priorities.\"\n\nOffering patients greater choice was one of Labour's flagship health policies, which were announced on Monday.\n\nRachel Power, of the Patients Association, said the move will \"make it easier\" for patients to use their long-established right to choose.\n\nBut making progress will also be dependent on the NHS seeing more patients.\n\nWhile progress has been made on the very longest waits, the number of operations being done is still below pre-pandemic levels. This is because hospitals have struggled to get back to full capacity, mainly because of staffing shortages, more emergency patients and problems discharging patients because of the lack of care in the community.\n\nLabour has also criticised the government for not making more use of the private sector, pointing out there has been capacity for another 300,000 patients to have been seen privately over the last 15 months than has happened.\n\nPrivate hospitals are paid at NHS prices to see patients, under agreements in place with the health service.\n\nMiriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said while the initiative was welcome, improving access to patient choice was \"not a panacea\".\n\nShe said until the staffing shortages were resolved it would be more difficult to make progress.\n\nOne in 10 posts is currently vacant in the NHS.", "Joseph James O'Connor was arrested in Spain in 2021\n\nA British national extradited to the US last month has pleaded guilty in New York to a role in one of the biggest hacks in social media history.\n\nThe July 2020 Twitter hack affected over 130 accounts including those of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nJoseph James O'Connor, 23, known as PlugwalkJoe, pleaded guilty to hacking charges carrying a total maximum sentence of over 70 years in prison.\n\nThe hacking was part of a large-scale Bitcoin scam.\n\nO'Connor, who was extradited from Spain, hijacked numerous Twitter accounts and sent out tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to an account, promising to double their money.\n\nO'Connor, from Liverpool, was charged alongside three other men over the scam.\n\nUS teenager Graham Ivan Clark pleaded guilty in 2021. Nima Fazeli of Orlando, Florida, and Mason Sheppard, of Bognor Regis in the UK, were charged with federal crimes.\n\nUS Assistant Attorney-General Kenneth Polite Jr described in a statement O'Connor's actions as \"flagrant and malicious\", saying he had \"harassed, threatened and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm\".\n\nCelebrities including US boxer Floyd Mayweather and the singer Wiz Khalifa also lost control of their accounts\n\n\"Like many criminal actors, O'Connor tried to stay anonymous by using a computer to hide behind stealth accounts and aliases from outside the United States.\n\n\"But this plea shows that our investigators and prosecutors will identify, locate, and bring to justice such criminals to ensure they face the consequences for their crimes.\"\n\nIn 2020, an estimated 350 million Twitter users saw suspicious tweets from official accounts of the platform's biggest users. Thousands fell for a scam, trusting that a crypto giveaway was real.\n\nCyber experts agreed that the consequences of the Twitter hack could have been far worse if O'Connor and other hackers had more sophisticated plans than a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nDisinformation could have been spread to affect political discourse and markets could have been moved by well-worded fake business announcements, for example.\n\nThe hack showed how fragile Twitter's security was at the time. The attackers telephoned a small number of Twitter employees with a believable tale to convince them to hand over their internal login details - which eventually granted the hackers access to Twitter's powerful administrative tools.\n\nEssentially, the hackers managed to use social engineering tricks more akin to those of conmen than of high-level cyber-criminals to get access to the powerful internal control panel at the site.\n\nMike Bloomberg and Kanye West were among those hacked\n\nIt was, and still is, a hugely embarrassing moment in Twitter's troubled history.\n\nO'Connor's admission has not come as a shock though as there was a wealth of evidence in the public domain thanks to the hackers making some bad mistakes or being too loud in their celebrations in the aftermath of the hack.\n\nO'Connor also pleaded guilty to other hacking crimes including gaining access to a high-profile TikTok account.\n\nHe posted a video to that account where his own voice is recognisable and threatened to release \"sensitive, personal material\" related to the owner of the account to people who joined a Discord group.\n\nThe US justice department said he had also used technology to stalk a minor.", "The Russian defence ministry released photos of what it said were abandoned or damaged Western military vehicles, including US-made Humvees\n\nThe US has distanced itself from an incursion into Russia - which Moscow says ended in the defeat of armed insurgents who entered from Ukraine.\n\nParts of the border region of Belgorod came under attack on Monday, in one of the largest cross-border raids since Russia invaded its neighbour last year.\n\nRussia later released pictures of abandoned or damaged Western military vehicles, including US-made Humvees.\n\nThe US insisted it did not \"encourage or enable strikes inside of Russia\".\n\nA state department spokesman acknowledged reports \"circulating on social media and elsewhere\" that US-supplied weapons had been used, but said his country was \"sceptical at this time of the veracity of these reports\".\n\nIn a news briefing on Tuesday, Matthew Miller added: \"It is up to Ukraine to decide how to conduct this war.\"\n\nSome Ukrainian military experts and bloggers have suggested that the images of destroyed US vehicles released by Russia could have been staged.\n\nVillages in Belgorod near the border were evacuated after coming under fire. Russia says 70 attackers were killed, and has insisted the fighters were Ukrainian.\n\nBut Kyiv denies involvement - and two Russian paramilitary groups opposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin say they were behind the incursion.\n\nMonday's raid led Moscow to declare a counter-terrorism operation, giving the authorities special powers to clamp down on communications and people's movements.\n\nThe measures were only lifted the following afternoon, and even then, one of the paramilitary groups was claiming it still controlled a small piece of Russian territory.\n\nRegional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said one civilian had died while being evacuated, and several others were injured during the violence.\n\nIn a later development, he said the region had been subject to a \"large\" number of drone attacks overnight on Tuesday. He said the attacks damaged private vehicles, houses and offices, but there were no victims.\n\nMr Gladkov also said a gas pipeline was damaged in the Graivoron district by the drone barrage, which led to a small fire on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified - although the BBC was able to establish that a building used by Russia's main security agency, the FSB, was among those hit during the violence. It is not clear what caused the damage.\n\nAnother Russian photo showed a wrecked vehicle with the words \"for Bakhmut\" written in Russian on the side\n\nCommenting on the hostilities in Belgorod, Russia's defence ministry said a \"unit of a Ukrainian nationalist formation\" had invaded its territory to carry out attacks.\n\nOne of its photos showed a wrecked vehicle with the words \"for Bakhmut\" written on it, a reference to the Ukrainian city which Russia says it has recently captured - a claim disputed by Kyiv.\n\nAs well as killing dozens of what it described as \"Ukrainian terrorists\" in artillery and air strikes, the ministry claimed to have driven the rest of the fighters back to the Ukrainian border.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials said the attackers were Russians, from groups known as the Liberty of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC).\n\nSocial media posts from the two paramilitary groups appeared to confirm their involvement. Both groups also told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne that they were creating \"a demilitarised zone on the border with the Russian Federation from which they will not be able to shell Ukraine\".\n\nAny assaults on Russian soil make leaders in the Nato military alliance of Western countries nervous - meaning that the developments could prove a mixed blessing for Kyiv.\n\nThe cross-border incursion may be embarrassing for Moscow, and go some way to offset the bad optics for Ukraine of reportedly losing control of Bakhmut after months of intense and bloody fighting.\n\nIt is also likely to be part of Ukraine's shaping operations ahead of its coming counter-offensive, aiming to draw Russian troops away from the south where Kyiv is expected to attack.\n\nBut it is not a development that is likely to be welcomed by the West.\n\nThe long-range weapons these countries have provided to Kyiv - although not used in this attack - still come with the proviso they are not to be used to hit targets inside Russia.\n\nDespite official denials from Kyiv, it is hard to believe this raid was launched without assistance from Ukrainian military intelligence.\n\nIt plays into the Kremlin narrative that Russia's own sovereign security is under attack from malign forces backed by the West.\n\nIt is a narrative likely to be fuelled by reports that some of those who took part are linked to far-right extremism, reinforcing Moscow's claim that it is trying to rid Ukraine of neo-Nazis.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Liam Kavanagh gained millions of pounds of investment in his solar farms\n\nA businessman cheated a council out of tens of millions of pounds and went on a spending spree with the cash, an investigation has discovered.\n\nLeaked documents reveal how Liam Kavanagh used Thurrock Council's money to buy luxury goods, including a yacht and a private jet.\n\nThe council has been made effectively bankrupt after investing \u00a3655m in Mr Kavanagh's solar farm business.\n\nMr Kavanagh's lawyers say all the payments were permissible.\n\nThey say they were approved by his company's finance team and auditor.\n\nThurrock is one of a number of councils that have got into financial difficulties since the coalition government gave local authorities more freedom to raise funds and invest in 2011.\n\nWoking, Slough and Croydon have all been forced to stop all non-essential spending after losing public money on risky investments.\n\nThe Audit Commission - a spending watchdog that stopped councils taking too many risks - was abolished in 2015.\n\nConservative-led Thurrock Council started investing cash with Mr Kavanagh's business Rockfire the following year.\n\nThe idea was that the council would get regular interest payments from the profits and its cash would be safe because it was secured against the value of the solar farms.\n\nBut the interest payments stopped after Mr Kavanagh wound up his companies and the estimated value of the solar farms is less than the council thought.\n\nAdministrators are now selling the solar farms and Thurrock is facing a \u00a3200m shortfall on its investment.\n\nThe council has been forced to cut services and put up council tax.\n\nVickki Jarmyn has run a dance group for people with learning difficulties in the area for the past 14 years.

How can you just do that?\"\n\nThe investigation - by BBC Panorama and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism - has revealed how the value of Liam Kavanagh's solar farms was inflated to persuade the council to invest more cash.\n\nRockfire had one of its solar farm portfolios revalued in 2018. The company gave valuers a power price of \u00a361.45 per megawatt hour (MWh), but the average power price for the portfolio at the time was \u00a346.92/MWh.\n\nIn 2020, Mr Kavanagh was told by staff that the average power price was predicted to be \u00a341.70/MWh. But he insisted the valuers should be given an inflated price of \u00a362/MWh, which they seemed to accept.\n\nGavin Cunningham, a former investigator with the Serious Fraud Office, told Panorama that supplying inaccurate energy prices was potentially fraudulent.\n\nMr Cunningham said: \"The effect of that will be that you end up with a far greater valuation of the overall portfolio of solar farms than is actually the case. And anyone relying on that information is going to be misled by it.\"\n\nMr Kavanagh owned multiple solar farms, including this one in Wiltshire\n\nBy 2018, Thurrock had already invested more than half a billion pounds in Mr Kavanagh's business.\n\nThe inflated valuations convinced the council to invest a further \u00a3130m - but the money never reached the solar farms.\n\nLeaked documents from Rockfire reveal how Mr Kavanagh spent council money on himself instead.\n\nA ledger of payments shows \u00a312m went to a company that bought Liam Kavanagh's private jet.\n\nThere are also payments totalling \u00a32m for his Bugatti Chiron car and \u00a316m for his yacht Heureka.\n\nA further \u00a340m disappears into a bank account labelled \"other\".\n\nAn email Mr Kavanagh sent in 2020 suggests he always planned to spend council cash on himself. It says: \"These funds\u2026 will be used to create a new family investment office and to create wealth for years to come. This has always been my plan.\"\n\nMr Kavanagh is no longer living in the UK.\n\nThe Millionaire who Cheated a Council is on BBC iPlayer now and will be on BBC One at 20:00 BST (22:40 BST in Wales)\n\nHis lawyers said the transactions were all legal and that he was entitled to spend the council money on whatever he wanted.\n\nThey said there were no restrictions on how the investments were to be used, the solar assets were not overvalued and the power prices submitted were honest predictions.\n\nMr Kavanagh said Thurrock had approached him about the investments and they had produced significant income for the council over a number of years.\n\nHe said: \"I have never misled Thurrock Council during the course of those investments. It was always my understanding that Thurrock Council conducted its own independent due diligence into investments.\"\n\nLast month, a report by Essex County Council criticised Thurrock for its risky investment decisions and failure to make proper checks.

Lara, 25, stopped the 34-year-old Englishman in February but vacated the belt on Friday after failing to make weight for this rematch in Manchester. The Mexican's sluggish movement was in contrast to the clever, dominant performance of Wood. Wood knocked down Lara in round two and never looked in trouble thereafter. The judges scored it 118-109, 116-111 and 118-109 in his favour. \"I should've done that first time around,\" Wood told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He's tricky - if you switch off he will put your lights out. I was so focused, so driven, I was never going to fail no matter what.\" Wood was the only fighter at AO Arena who could leave with the belt - had the Mexican won, the title would have been left vacant. However, Wood never looked likely to give up the opportunity to reclaim the belt he first won in July 2021 as he made amends for the previous defeat to Lara, when he looked on top before being stopped in the seventh round. Wood had clearly learned his lessons, putting on a much more defensively secure and technically assured performance. Lara, meanwhile, looked to run out of ideas early on and despite a 4lbs weight advantage and facing an opponent who had gone through a weigh cut, he rarely troubled his opponent. The tempo was set in round two, when a right uppercut instantly followed by a short left saw Wood knock his opponent to the canvas. Lara got up quickly, but was now on the back foot and never recovered his composure as a partisan crowd roared on Nottingham-born Wood. Wood continued to attack with big punches right and left, and not even a cut suffered near his left eye in round four could stop his flow. That cut did become more of an issue and had to be tended to by his corner, however it was ruled to have been caused by an accidental clash of heads, so the fight would have been decided by scorecard if it resulted in a stoppage - and Wood always looked ahead. The final six rounds saw Wood keep Lara at arm's length, with stabs to the body causing the Mexican particular issues. Wood wants to fight at Nottingham Forest's City Ground before he retires At the final bell, Wood immediately raced to salute the crowd, before calling for a homecoming fight at Nottingham Forest's football stadium. \"It's amazing. There's only one thing that can top it and that's fighting at home at the City Ground,\" he told DAZN. \"It will be the next one or the one after.\" Into his mid-30s, Wood admitted he only has a limited number of top level bouts remaining - and wants to hit all his dream targets before he is done. He called out Luis Alberto Lopez for a unification bout, after the Mexican stopped Michael Conlan in his own back yard of Belfast earlier on Saturday night in their IBF featherweight encounter. Wood also said he would be keen to face Josh Warrington - however, fighting at Forest's ground is the big one.\"I probably have two fights left, City Ground one, unification another.

So much trauma,\" said Dr Inna Dymitr, stroking the soldier's pale face as he slipped back into unconsciousness and the ambulance swerved, at furious speed, heading away from the frontlines south-east of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe young soldier's name was Oleh. In a trench that morning, shrapnel from an exploding Russian mortar had dug a large hole in his lower back, quite possibly severing his spinal cord.\n\n\"He's stable, but in a serious condition. We get so many like him,\" said Dr Dymitr, listing half a dozen other cases from recent days. She works for a private, Western-funded aid group, MOAS.\n\nAs the casualties from Ukraine's counter-offensive mount, it is easy to see why - on a rare visit to this closely guarded section of the southern front - some soldiers and observers are starting to wonder if a breakthrough is possible, or whether Russia's defensive lines, built up and heavily-reinforced over the winter months, are simply too much of a barrier.\n\n\"Without more [Western] help, I think we might lose this game,\" said Kyrylo Potras, a Ukrainian marine whose lower left leg was torn off by a Russian mine in 2020, but who has now returned to the frontlines. Potras said the presence of vast Russian minefields was proving a huge obstacle.\n\n\"These Russians\u2026 there are a lot [of them]. They have many anti-tank guns and missile systems,\" he said.\n\nAnd yet, one month into this long-planned counter-attack, there are plenty of soldiers and experts who vehemently disagree, judging that the opening phase is going according to plan, and that the active frontline - which stretches in a rough arc for more than 1,000km (620 miles) from the Black Sea Coast up to Ukraine's north-eastern border with Russia - was never going to be breached with the same abrupt speed that Kyiv's forces achieved last year.\n\nHaving spent the last few weeks visiting three separate sections of the front and talking to a range of people, I'm tempted to divide these differing perspectives into three broad groups: those who see Russia's defensive lines as if they're made of tin, those who see them as wood, and those who imagine them as glass.\n\nThe tin theory - malleable but resilient - was first sketched out for me, more than two weeks ago, by a weary medic I met at a field hospital close to the near-obliterated Donbas town of Bakhmut.\n\nAmidst the crash and boom of artillery fire, he described Ukraine's mounting casualties, warned that Russia had had too long to prepare its defences and had too many troops, and concluded that while Ukraine might be able to push the frontline back, perhaps even by tens of kilometres, it would struggle to do more than dent Russia's over-all strategic hold of east and south-eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"I think this war will not be resolved in the battlefield. It will end with a political deal,\" he said gloomily.\n\nThe wood theory - by which I mean a frontline more likely to snap and splinter, but not collapse - was brought home to me some three hours' drive southwest of Bakhmut, beyond the small town of Velyka Novosilka.\n\nIn the fields and rolling hills that stretch towards the Black Sea, Ukrainian forces were pushing forwards, finding ways through the minefields and attacking Russian positions from unexpected angles, and - slowly, but steadily - capturing significant chunks of territory and several villages and small towns.\n\n\"I'm a realist, although some people call me a pessimist,\" said Artem, a 36-year-old soldier, as a Ukrainian jet roared overhead. His view was that Russian troop morale was low, and that Ukraine was likely to make some significant breakthroughs in the coming months. But he could not see the counter-offensive turning into a rout, like it briefly did last November.\n\nArtem does not believe the Russians will be routed, as they were from parts of eastern Ukraine last year\n\n\"The media and society are in a hurry. [But] the worst option is always possible,\" he added, wondering what sort of \"price\" Ukraine would be prepared to make in terms of the likely casualties involved forcing a strategic break in Russia's frontlines.\n\nIt is notable that the gloomier perspectives regarding Ukraine's counter-offensive tend to come from soldiers closest to the frontlines and most heavily involved in combat operations.\n\nYou could argue that they have the most experience and the most realistic views. But it's also reasonable to point out that these soldiers are least able to see the bigger picture, focused, as they are, on small sections of a huge military operation.\n\nWhich brings me to the glass theory: the view - widely held by prominent western military analysts like Mick Ryan and generals like UK armed forces chief Sir Tony Radakin - that the counter-offensive is on course and that in weeks, or months, Russia's defences will shatter, allowing Ukraine to seize strategically significant territory and to advance close to (if not into) the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThis theory's supporters urge patience, not pessimism, arguing that Ukraine's lack of airpower means it cannot do the vital early work of destroying Russia's \"operational system\" - meaning its logistical supply-lines and command centres - with the speed it would like.\n\nInstead, Ukrainian forces are using ground-based missiles to do the work, and at the same time attacking Russian positions in as many places as possible in order to tie up, and destroy, as much enemy manpower and equipment as possible.\n\n\"Starve, stretch and strike,\" was how Sir Tony, Britain's Chief of Defence Staff, described the strategy in parliament this week, concluding that Russia has already \"lost nearly half the combat effectiveness of its army.\"\n\nWe believe and wait... We just need to be patient\n\nIn another field hospital - where Oleh, the 19-year-old soldier with a severe back injury had briefly been patched up by medics before getting an ambulance ride to Zaporizhzhia - a Ukrainian doctor who asked that we use only his first name, Yevhen, summed up what I would still describe as the dominant, and optimistic, mood of most Ukrainian soldiers and officials I've met here.\n\n\"Everyone is waiting for [the breakthrough]. We believe and wait. We know everything will be fine. We just need to be patient,\" he said with a smile, sitting in the sunshine outside the well-organised field hospital, with the boom of outgoing artillery rounds echoing in the distance.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "You've been capturing the snow around the UK today.\n\nHere's some of our favourite shots.\n\nWhile some have been experiencing travel woes, others have been making the most of the snowy weather Image caption: While some have been experiencing travel woes, others have been making the most of the snowy weather\n\nA Weather Watcher in North Wales sent in this striking image of the ice on plants at Keepers Pond, Blaenavon Image caption: A Weather Watcher in North Wales sent in this striking image of the ice on plants at Keepers Pond, Blaenavon\n\nAs you can tell, we're partial to your pictures of our canine friends - this one is in Derbyshire Image caption: As you can tell, we're partial to your pictures of our canine friends - this one is in Derbyshire\n\nWe're also partial to a sun set scene, especially when it features a dusting of snow - such as this view over Loch Broom, near Ullapool in the Highlands Image caption: We're also partial to a sun set scene, especially when it features a dusting of snow - such as this view over Loch Broom, near Ullapool in the Highlands", "Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in 2014\n\nUsing the next general election as a \"de facto referendum\" is still an option, the Scottish government's independence minister has said.\n\nJamie Hepburn said \"no option should be taken off the table\" ahead of a special SNP independence convention next month.\n\nMr Hepburn also revealed the Scottish government will resume publishing a series of papers which set out the case for a Yes vote.\n\nOpposition parties have criticised the SNP's renewed focus on independence.\n\nLabour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray argued the cost of living crisis should be a bigger priority for SNP ministers.\n\nAppearing on the BBC Scotland Sunday Show, Mr Hepburn said the SNP would use the independence convention event on 24 June to \"discuss what our platform will be in advance of the 2024 general election\".\n\nAsked if the possibility of a de facto referendum approach was still on the table, he said: \"The first minister has said that so long as it's rightly within the parameters of a legal, electoral route then no option should be taken off the table.\n\n\"So that will form part of our discussion.\"\n\nJamie Hepburn said SNP members will discuss the party's independence strategy at a special conference next month\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has said he wants a \"consistent majority for independence\" and will focus on making the case for a Yes vote because he knows pushing for a referendum immediately will be rejected.\n\nBut when Nicola Sturgeon was first minister she said she wanted to use the next UK general election - which must be held by January 2025 at the latest - as a de facto referendum.\n\nThis would involve treating the votes for the SNP at a general election as votes for independence and then looking to open negotiations with the UK government about Scotland's exit from the UK.\n\nHowever, the UK government has previously dismissed the idea, which has also attracted some criticism within the SNP.\n\nHumza Yousaf has pledged to take a positive independence message to people around the country\n\nThe convention in Dundee next month is likely to form part of more activity from the SNP on the issue of a second independence referendum.\n\nMr Hepburn told BBC Scotland that in the coming weeks another paper on the case for independence, produced by a team of Scottish government civil servants, will be published.\n\nThe first paper of this series - called Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland? - made comparisons between Scotland and other European countries and was published in June last year.\n\nSubsequent papers were billed as looking at areas including currency, tax and spend, defence, social security and pensions, and EU membership and trade.\n\nHumza Yousaf has also pledged a \"summer of independence campaign activity\" which would \"take our positive message to every corner of the country\".\n\nWriting in The National, he said the party was working hard to organise regional independence assemblies, something he pledged on the campaign trail for the SNP leadership.\n\nLabour's shadow Scottish secretary Mr Murray said the Scottish government should be \"concentrating on bread and butter issues\".\n\nHe added: \"It's the same old story, over and over again.\n\n\"The Scottish public will not be very amused that during the worst cost of living crisis in history the SNP are reverting to type and talking about independence.\n\n\"Why we have a very expensive \u00a3100,00-a-year minister for independence when we need everyone's focus on the cost of living crisis is completely beyond my comprehension.\"\n\nDonald Cameron, Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman, added: \"Jamie Hepburn couldn't have made it more obvious that the SNP have no intention of tackling Scotland's real priorities.\n\n\"They're having yet another conference, just for their members, on how to break up the UK - something Scots decisively rejected.\"\n\nThey want Scottish independence to be achieved by a process which is beyond any legal or moral dispute and in clear accordance with international law.\n\nTheir ideal scenario is a second independence referendum on a straightforward yes-no question.\n\nBut the Supreme Court made it clear that Holyrood does not have the power to hold one without UK government permission.\n\nThere are a number of other options - none of them straightforward.\n\nOne argument is that a future election - perhaps the next general election or Scottish Parliament election- could be turned into a defacto referendum.\n\nIf more than 50% of people voted for the SNP or another pro-independence party, it would be considered by them to be a vote for independence itself. The hope of those who advance that argument would be that this would quickly result in an actual referendum on independence itself.\n\nAnother argument is that SNP MPs could try to \"force\" a future Westminster government which was short of a majority to concede a referendum in return for their support.\n\nBut both Labour and the Conservatives are adamant that will not happen.\n\nThen there is the argument that the best way forward for supporters of independence is simply to keep on trying to increase support for it.\n\nThey would contend that, sooner or later, the point could come when it was clear that independence was consistently supported by a significant majority of Scots so it would be impossible in practice to deny a referendum.\n\nThese ideas, and other strategies, will no doubt be discussed at next month's convention.", "Colourful drone displays have taken place across the country as part of the King's Coronation concert.\n\nThe drones formed together to create different animals and moments in nature, as Alexis Ffrench and Zak Abel performed a cover of Don't You Forget About Me by Simple Minds.", "It's a well-worn trope that the politicians who look after our wallets are the ones who tend to win.\n\nWith interest rates still climbing, inflation still gobbling up spending power and taxes at historically high levels, times are hard for millions.\n\nA winning political party certainly needs smart answers. Labour has been miles ahead in the polls for many months, but can the party, and its shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves - who is on our show this Sunday - persuade you their answers add up?\n\nLabour are not short of slogans about the state of the economy. You only need to glance at their MPs' social media, or dip into the House of Commons for a few minutes, to hear one of the economic charges they are levelling against the Conservatives.\n\nBut when you look closely at the party's actual plans, it is not so easy to spot the difference.\n\nTaxes are already very high and Labour has no desire to raise them beyond a couple of specific, and relatively minor changes, like charging VAT on private school fees and altering non-dom status (where a UK resident whose permanent home is outside the country pays British taxes on money earned here but not on income from overseas).\n\nWhat about spending on public services? With the election probably still more than a year away Labour doesn't want to be drawn - although you'll hear some shadow ministers make warm noises about spending \"more\".\n\nAnd there's not an obvious difference when it comes to spending on benefits either. Both main parties want to keep the very expensive protection for pensioners - the so-called \"triple lock\".\n\nTo the irritation of many Labour left-wingers they have not committed to getting rid of the two-child limit, where parents who have a third or subsequent child do not qualify for additional financial support. So on the traditional areas of tax, spending and benefits, playing spot the difference between the government and the wannabe government doesn't get you that far.\n\nThere are important distinctions we'll come to in a second, but it is worth pondering the mixture of politics and policies that seems to make the gap quite narrow.\n\nFirst, Labour know the Conservatives will grab any shred of evidence to suggest their opponents will splash the cash irresponsibly.\n\nMs Reeves has long been trying to counter that with the strict message that all spending has to be paid for. Her so-called \"fiscal rules\" mean a hypothetical Labour government would only borrow to invest.\n\nThat is frustrating to some in Labour, with one MP on the party's left telling me: \"I know the front bench is concerned about appearing credible, and the conclusion is to spend less money, but because things are so bad we have to be much bolder.\"\n\nAnother MP said the \"self-imposed strait-jacket is going to be more and more of a problem\".\n\nThere is zero chance that Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are going to budge on this.\n\nThat's not just because they don't want to give the Tories an inch, but because they have what a source described as a genuinely \"hard-headed\" even \"zealot-like\" approach to controlling spending. This is not just a political decision, it's based on principles too.\n\nWith the economy in a bad way, a safety-first attitude prevails - especially after the pandemonium of the Truss government last autumn.\n\nAs one Labour-backing City insider says: \"The whole approach right now is to ensure investors are confident in the UK.\"\n\nAnother source suggested \"people in the City are quite worried that this government and the regulators have already moved a long way to the interventionist side of things - Rachel will have heard that in spades\".\n\nLabour also knows not to reveal its hand this far from an election. That's partly because the financial pressures people face will change by the time the UK goes to the polls. And there is always a risk of your rivals nabbing your plans.\n\nThere are differences though - most notably Labour's promise to spend up to \u00a328bn a year on shifting to a greener economy. The party would create a National Wealth Fund to invest in big projects and create a state-owned green power firm called GB Energy.\n\nWhile Ms Reeves may not have an intensely detailed programme, she does have a new brand: \"Securonomics\".\n\n\"Securonomics\" is meant to be a whole new way of doing business. Making and selling more in the UK, creating more lasting jobs, and working more closely with industry to make sure the country is competing with its rivals.\n\nIt is meant to sound radical, but what it means in practice is unclear. As one source put it: \"Securonomics is extremely clever because it feels like there is a lot in there but it is not very obvious what is.\"\n\nThere is an opportunity for Labour here. Even without the finer details, there is clear difference over how much the main parties would be prepared to intervene in the economy.\n\nLabour has watered down its pledge to invest in more green energy\n\nLabour is also likely to make a big thing in the run up to the next election of expanding workers' rights. While what will actually end up in the manifesto is yet to be finalised, one shadow minister says you can expect it to be a \"big part of the offer\" across the UK.\n\nSo while Labour's Treasury team shares some of the Conservatives' view that now is not the time to go wild with public spending or borrowing, there are important distinctions.\n\nBut that shared instinct to be careful with the cash is getting stronger because of what is happening to interest rates.\n\nOne economist notes that if short and medium-term interest rates are one percentage point higher than expected it raises borrowing by \u00a320bn in the medium term.\n\nSo it is getting more expensive for the government to borrow - as is the cost of repaying the debts the country already has.\n\nOf course there are always economic choices about taking an alternative approach. But the desire to keep debt down is something Labour's leadership and the Conservatives share.\n\nMs Reeves has scaled back her green ambitions just as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has talked down the prospect of tax cuts.\n\nVoters on the left may be frustrated that Labour is promising less than in recent years, but it is harder to make big promises when there is less to go around - so we shouldn't expect a cheque book election.", "Rory O'Connor says \"transformational\" speech and language therapy is \"being taken away\" from his seven-year-old son Lorcan\n\nThe father of an autistic child has said he is very angry over the decision to scrap a schools fund that provided extra support to disadvantaged pupils.\n\nRory O'Connor said his son's life had been \"transformed\" by speech and language therapy (SLT) sessions, funded by the Extended Schools Programme.\n\nThe scheme enabled almost 500 schools to provide extras like counselling, SLT, breakfasts and after-school clubs.\n\nBut school principals have been told the fund is being axed from 30 June.\n\nIn a letter to schools, Stormont's Department of Education (DE) said it had to make \"significant savings\" in 2023-24 and the programme \"is no longer available\".\n\nThe O'Connor family, from Lurgan, County Armagh, are among those who have been advised the additional support services their children receive in school are now under threat because of budget cutbacks.\n\n\"I just can't believe it,\" Mr O'Connor told BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme.\n\nHis seven-year-old son, Lorcan, has special educational needs as well as autism and previously found it difficult to make himself understood.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Lorcan has benefited from SLT sessions at his Craigavon school, funded through the Extended Schools Programme.\n\n\"Over the past year and a half it has really transformed him from a child who was unable to communicate his needs to a completely different child that can communicate with us as a family; communicate with his peers,\" Mr O'Connor said.\n\nHe added the speech therapy \"equips him to be a fully-functioning member of the school and society, and that's being taken away from him\".\n\n\"The thing I'm really cross about is that there is nobody accountable,\" Lorcan's father added.\n\n\"There should be a minister for education coming and defending the decision to cut this and unfortunately in our country, we don't have that.\"\n\nLorcan became a \"completely different child\" with extra support in school, his father said\n\nBudget pressures have already led to DE funding being cut for schemes including holiday hunger payments, counselling for primary school children and free books for babies.\n\nThe Extended Schools scheme has been running since 2006 and more than \u00a39m was provided to about 500 schools in 2022/23.\n\nThe schools received sums of between \u00a31,000 to about \u00a333,000 in 2022/23, depending on their pupil numbers and needs.\n\nTo be eligible for funding, schools need to have more than 37% of pupils who are entitled to free school meals or more than half who live in a disadvantaged area.\n\nSome head teachers used it to pay for breakfasts for pupils as the cost of living rose.\n\nBut in its letter to head teachers, the department said the education budget was facing significant cuts.\n\n\"As with all other departments, the Department of Education is yet to receive its confirmed budget allocation,\" the letter said.\n\n\"However, the indicative budget allocation recently advised by the Northern Ireland Office is extremely challenging for education.\n\n\"The Extended Schools Programme has been supported in recent years with \u00a35.8m of funding from the [DUP/Conservative] confidence and supply agreement.\n\n\"This funding is no longer available and, due to the extent of budget pressures, it is not possible for this to be covered from the Department of Education's budget.\n\n\"Consequently, unless additional funding is allocated by the secretary of state, funding can only be provided for the Extended Schools Programme to the end of the academic year, June 2023.\"\n\nSchools used much of the money to help pupils whose families were struggling with the rising cost of living\n\nThe department said it was making about \u00a32.2m available so schools could continue to offer support paid for by the scheme until the end of the school year in June.\n\nIts letter also said that DE recognised \"how disappointing this is for everyone involved in the delivery of this long-standing programme, and for the young people and families who have benefitted from its support over many years\".\n\nThere has been an angry reaction from trade unions to the end of the Extended Schools Programme.\n\nThe northern secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) Mark McTaggart said the decision would \"directly impact on the most vulnerable children in our schools\".\n\n\"It is time that politicians stopped playing with the lives of the most vulnerable young people in our society, got back to real politics and began to find the necessary funding to ensure that we can offer the world class education system everybody wants,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\nIn a statement, Justin McCamphill from the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) said ending the scheme was yet another blow to our most vulnerable children and young people.\n\nMeanwhile, Alan Law from the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) union said the scheme was being wrecked and the valuable and important work destroyed.\n\n\"It is shameful that these decisions are being taken without anyone being accountable,\" he said.\n\nChild counselling in schools was among the services which received financial support from the fund\n\nPrincipal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, Colin Torrens, said the Extended Schools scheme had provided a range of vital services at his school.\n\nThat includes the breakfast club, school councillors and extra numeracy and literacy support for pupils.

SNP leader Humza Yousaf called it a \"dark day\" for Westminster.", "Boris Johnson had to leave Downing Street last summer because a majority of his Conservative colleagues thought he was doing more harm than good.\n\nNow a committee of MPs is set to judge he didn't tell the truth. That committee is made up mainly of Tory MPs. The former PM has faced the same procedure as other MPs that get into trouble. And while Mr Johnson claims he has been \"forced out\", remember he has chosen to quit before we even see the black and white of their verdict.\n\nIt is also a fact there are some Conservatives who begrudge him his success. It is also true that during his last few months in No 10 there were internal enemies trying to force him out.\n\nBut to dress that up as a grand conspiracy is, candidly, a stretch. One of those who knows him best told me his resignation announcement was \"1,000 words that tell you everything about Johnson's mindset - it's your fault not mine\".\n\nRather than confront what has happened or try to defend himself from the judgement that is coming, Boris Johnson made a political choice this week not to stay and fight.\n\nAs ever, the line between farce and tragedy is skinny. While most of the headlines screamed of the shock, the former prime minister's exit from Parliament is entirely on brand.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe timing on a Friday was unexpected, but no surprise. He never much liked Parliament anyway, even though he managed to find a gong for the Commons' hairdresser.\n\nThe idea he would savour being a humble backbencher asking questions about cash for the local hospital or appearing at school fetes was for the birds. And if the Privileges Committee's findings are as savage as expected he would have faced a by-election.\n\nClues from his track record tell us there is little chance he would have fought if he hadn't been sure he could win. He pulled out of the Tory leadership race in 2016 when Michael Gove's move blew up his status as front-runner.\n\nHe didn't run in 2022 despite a dash back from the Caribbean and fevered claims that he had enough support. One former cabinet ally says he is \"more calculating than people think and this will have been a calculation - if he thought he would win the by-election he would stay\". To win and lose does not match brand Boris. To leave like this absolutely does.\n\nThe power of his personality - frankly his fame - means he leaves behind some devastated colleagues and a strand of the public who believe he has been hard done by.\n\nOne former cabinet minister says: \"The party wounded itself when it defenestrated Boris and continues to bleed.\"\n\nSome of his hard-core supporters left on the backbenches say his exit is a sad day for democracy and - with some justification believe his leadership is what secured their seats, particularly in parts of the country where the Tories could never have dreamt of doing well before.\n\nSome of his loyal backers do feel like he is the great hero in a tragedy, cast aside unfairly in an epic drama, undone by those who envy his talents.\n\nHis exit is arguably a tragedy for those who genuinely believed in and adored him. And there is a political tragedy for the Conservative Party, which many MPs privately believe squandered a once in a generation majority.\n\n2019 gave it one of those rare chances to make radical changes to the country, and while many believe it was thrown away by mismanagement and mistakes, there was of course the unexpected horror of the Covid pandemic too.\n\nFor those who deplore Boris Johnson, there is a different kind of tragedy, the damage they believe he did to the UK's reputation. And several of those who have been close to him over the years identify a fourth element of the mess - the fact they believe it was never going to end well.\n\nIn the Greek tragedies so beloved of Mr Johnson himself, fate, and inevitability plays an important role. One of them says: \"Boris is a genuine tragedy. This was all inevitable. We knew how it would play out, but we are still surprised and shocked about how dreadful it is. All our hard work pissed away.\"\n\nSo what happens next? Some MPs are actually cock-a-hoop despite the colossal mess. One tells me: \"The man-baby has gone - so pleased!\"\n\nBut allies talk up his chances of running for another seat some time. One former senior minister tells me \"the question is does he plan to get another seat or even Mid-Beds?\" - the constituency his close ally and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has just left.\n\nAnother former cabinet minister says: \"It would be very unwise for him to run again. He has a vociferous 20% in the party who like him but 80% don't. If he ran in a by-election the Lib Dems would murder him.\"\n\nWould party HQ even let that happen? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has changed the personnel in charge there. One senior figure pours a bucket of freezing water over the idea telling me: \"Boris died today.\"\n\nWhat is not clear yet is whether as that MP suggests the manner of his departure could \"generate so much unrest I fear there will be an election much sooner than thought\".\n\nMr Johnson has thrown grenades at No 10 - not just the committee that has judged him - suggesting Mr Sunak is not running a \"proper Conservative\" government.\n\nOne former ally says the ex-PM has \"gone full circle, returning to his political home - a hut across the water where he can now lob rocks without any sense of responsibility or accountability - and that is ultimately very dangerous for his party and Sunak\".\n\nBut if Boris Johnson is unlikely to run for Parliament again, and is happy to dangle the prospect of a return, what else might he do with his time?\n\nYou'll find plenty of people in Westminster chattering that he'll return to his first love - writing - but might there be something bigger?\n\nBy chance his old newspaper the Telegraph has just come up for sale and - by chance - its former editor Will Lewis has just been made a knight by Mr Johnson. Is there, by chance, the possibility they might be part of a bid to take it over?\n\nIt's been suggested to me that is in fact something that has been discussed. It's no secret that Mr Lewis - now Sir Will - would be keen to take it on.\n\nHe advised Mr Johnson in No 10 sometimes and the two men worked together at the Telegraph when the former PM was its star columnist who attracted extra subscribers each week.\n\nGoing back as a columnist would be one thing for Mr Johnson and not all that surprising. But for him to take a bigger role - as one source whispers, the editor - might be the Conservatives' worst nightmare.\n\nI'm told that conversations are only at the stage of ideas being scribbled down on paper. A formal sale process, let alone any decisions about actual bids, is a long way off.\n\nBut I can't help wondering, what would the consequences be for Downing Street and the Conservatives if their most loyal backer in the press gave a major role to Mr Sunak's bitter rival? Could the next twist in the Boris Johnson story be even wilder than the last? Perhaps.\n\nWhat will be Boris Johnson's next job - running the Telegraph newspapers?\n\nSome of those who have worked alongside him believe it is more likely to be \"terminal Boris\". A former ally says \"he was obviously once someone with exceptional skills, who came so far, and did so much in the face of incredible opposition\".\n\nBut they say, perhaps in sorrow and in anger: \"His career ends with him alone, a victim of his utter inability to tell the truth to anyone, including himself.\"\n\nMaybe he will fade into obscurity. Perhaps he'll be back in Parliament one day. He might make millions speaking and writing or become Rishi Sunak's most powerful opposition.\n\nBut his name is now on the list of those unprovable political \"what ifs' so furiously and perpetually debated by political nerds.\n\nWhat if Mrs Thatcher hadn't been forced out? What if Tony Blair hadn't invaded Iraq? What if Boris Johnson had given a different answer in the Commons when he was first asked what happened under his roof during the Covid lockdowns?\n\nWe will never know. But what we do know this weekend is that one era is over. We know Boris Johnson had huge potential to create, but also to destroy - his extraordinary majority, his reputation, and the party he led too.\n\nHe must now decide what to do with the power that he still retains. And his old party must decide how much attention it wants to pay.", "Rioters run as French police officers use tear gas in Paris on 2 July\n\nRiots in France appear to be calming, after five days of violent protests in response to the shooting of teenager Nahel M during a police traffic stop.\n\nSunday night saw violence subside and fewer arrests were made.\n\nHowever, President Emmanuel Macron has asked the interior ministry to keep a \"massive\" police presence on the streets.\n\nOn Monday, mayors called for rallies to be held outside town halls to protest the violence and looting.\n\nIn Nanterre, Nahel's hometown, mayor Patrick Jarry said he was pleased the violence had subsided, but added that \"we shouldn't lose sight of the incident that sparked this situation and the continuing need for justice\".\n\nLater in the afternoon, several hundred people attended a rally in L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses in support of Vincent Jeanbrun, the mayor whose home was attacked by rioters who fired rockets at his fleeing wife and children, breaking her leg and injuring one of the children. The incident is being treated as attempted murder.\n\nA visibly emotional Mr Jeanbrun said: \"We saw the real faces of the rioters: they are murderers... They wanted to kill my wife and my two young children in their sleep by burning them alive.\"\n\nTo applause, Mr Jeanbrun also said that over the last week \"democracy itself was attacked... We need the majority of people who has so far been silent to say: enough!\"\n\nThe six days of riots have reportedly caused millions of euros worth of damage to public transport in the Paris region, the Ile-de-France transport network said.\n\nWhile Sunday night was far calmer, authorities were careful not to prematurely hail a return to normality on Monday.\n\nBuses and trams in the Paris region will again be halted early on Monday night, while President Macron has asked the ministry of the interior to maintain a \"massive\" police presence across France in order to guarantee a \"return to calm\".\n\nAbout 45,000 officers have been deployed across the country for the past three nights and will be out on the streets again on Monday, interior minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin confirmed.\n\nMore than 150 people were arrested on Sunday night, compared with more than 700 the night before.\n\nThere were 297 cars set on fire compared with Thursday's 1,900, while 34 buildings were damaged or set ablaze compared with more than 500 on Thursday.\n\nAt the weekend, the family of Nahel, the teenager who was killed by police, called for the violence to end.\n\nHis grandmother accused rioters of using Nahel's death as an excuse and urged them to stop destroying public goods.\n\nAnother relative told the BBC that the family did not want his death to spark riots, but insisted the law around lethal force at traffic stops must change.\n\nShe also said her \"heart is in pain\" about a GoFundMe page for the family of the police officer who shot Nahel, which as of Monday had raised more than \u20ac1.1m (\u00a3956,200) and was growing steadily.\n\nThe fundraiser, which was set up by a far-right media commentator, has been criticised by several politicians - but the platform told French newspaper Le Parisien that GoFundMe's terms and conditions were not being broken because the funds are destined for the officer's family and \"not meant for the legal defence of an alleged violent crime\".\n\nA fundraiser for Nahel's family was set up on a different platform and had raised \u20ac215,000 (\u00a3184,862) on Monday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, French regional authorities are starting to announce financial support measures for looted businesses and hospitality venues.\n\nGrants will be made available for business owners in Marseille and funding in the Paris region will help to restore the public buildings that were damaged and looted.\n\nBut there are concerns that the spate of violence might have a long-term effect on the tourism sector just as the summer season begins.\n\nFrench media outlet Le Point quoted a tourism official as estimating that up to 25% of hotel bookings in Paris had already been cancelled.\n\nThe regional transport network for Ile-de-France told AFP that \u20ac20m in damage was caused to public transport, including \"burned buses, a torched tramway, two damaged tramways and urban infrastructure which was smashed\".\n\nFran\u00e7ois Rial said that the riots posed \"a real risk\" to the image of France: \"This is true even if the unrest subsides, as many tourists are allergic to risk.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, President Macron will meet the mayors of 220 municipal areas that have been affected by the violence.", "Claire Robinson says the cuts are \"wholly unacceptable\"\n\nCuts to schools are \"dire\" and will affect support to the \"most vulnerable children\", according to a Belfast school principal.\n\nClaire Robinson from Holy Evangelists' Primary School has written to parents urging them to fight budget cuts.\n\nThe school in Twinbrook has about 560 pupils, two-thirds of whom are entitled to free school meals.\n\nThere have been numerous cuts to support for children as the Department of Education tries to make savings.\n\nMs Robinson's intervention comes as the Children's Law Centre told Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris that it will take legal action unless he takes steps \"to assess how to protect children from the cumulative effects of the budget cuts\".\n\nIn her letter Ms Robinson said Holy Evangelist had a \"huge cut\" of about \u00a3100,000 to its budget for 2023-24, as the school had lost funding for a number of services.\n\n\"Every decision we make always has your children at the heart, but I do feel it is now vital that you know the reality we are facing,\" she told parents.\n\nNurture units are special classes in which small groups of pupils receive specialist teaching and support\n\nThe school is one of 62 primaries which have a \"nurture unit\", a special class in which small groups of pupils receive specialist teaching and support.\n\nBut funding for those classes has been reduced.\n\nLike others, the school has also lost funding for things like counselling for pupils and will also be affected by cuts to sports coaching.\n\nMs Robinson said the cuts \"will impact on how we support our most vulnerable children, those with needs\".\n\n\"Those children who struggled in the aftermath of the pandemic now won't get any additional support classes which is a travesty,\" she continued.\n\n\"This is a dire situation and those who suffer will be your children, future generations and staff who will be feeling the pressure like never before.\n\n\"I for one think this is wholly unacceptable.\"\n\nMs Robinson also said the school would have to end providing a free snack at breaktime to pupils.\n\n\"From September children will need to bring a healthy snack each day.\"\n\nThe principal also apologised to parents that costs for the school's breakfast and after-schools clubs would increase by 50p an hour.\n\n\"For this I am sorry, but we can't continue to offer these services at the current rate,\" she wrote.\n\nMs Robinson asked parents to \"stand up and fight for the children\" by contacting politicians or the media.\n\n\"Shout from the roof tops, because our children matter,\" she concluded.\n\nFergal McFerran, of the Children's Law Centre said Mr Heaton-Harris had \"utterly failed\" to apply the principle of equality when setting his budget.\n\n\"We fear the cumulative impact his budget will have on children and young people will be severe, particularly those most disadvantaged.

US officials previously said it was unlikely a foreign power was to blame.\n\nBut in their assessment of \"anomalous health incidents\" (AHIs) - which was delivered last year - they did not give any alternative explanation, frustrating those who have been affected.\n\nThe American officials also acknowledged there were varying levels of confidence in the assessment between the different intelligence agencies involved.\n\nThe phenomenon gets its name from Cuba's capital Havana - where the first case was detected in 2016 - though the new report suggests the first cases may have happened in Germany two years earlier.\n\nOther cases have been reported around the world, from Washington to China.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said that a senior defence department official attending meetings at last year's Nato summit in Lithuania had experienced symptoms similar to Havana syndrome.\n\nAmerican personnel struck with the condition - including White House, CIA and FBI staff - have complained of dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating and an intense and painful sound in their ears.\n\nMore than 1,000 reports of the mysterious ailment have been made, with dozens of cases still officially considered unexplained. US lawmakers have passed legislation aimed at supporting victims.\n\nHowever, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study published last month said MRI scans had failed to detect evidence of brain injuries in dozens of US personnel who reported AHIs.\n\nThere has long been a suspicion that those affected have been hit by directed energy or microwaves fired from hidden devices - a possibility that was acknowledged in an earlier US intelligence report.\n\nThe fresh media investigation alleges that members of a specific Russian military intelligence unit - known as 29155 - may have targeted the brains of US diplomats with \"directed energy\" weapons.\n\nIt says there is evidence that places members of the unit in cities around the world at times when US personnel reported incidents.\n\nThe secretive unit undertakes foreign operations and has been linked to incidents including the attempted poisoning in the UK in 2018 of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy.\n\nAs part of the investigation, The Insider - a Russia-focused site - reported that an officer in the 29155 unit had been rewarded for their work related to the development of \"non-lethal acoustic weapons\".\n\nAn American military investigator examining instances of the syndrome told 60 Minutes that the common link between victims of the syndrome was a \"Russia nexus\".\n\nGreg Edgreen explained: \"There was some angle where they had worked against Russia, focused on Russia, and done extremely well.\"\n\nHe also said the official US bar of proof to show Russian involvement had been set too high, as his country did not want to \"face some very hard truths\".\n\nIn response to the media investigation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"No one has ever published or expressed any convincing evidence of these unfounded accusations anywhere. So, all of those are nothing more than unfounded accusations.\"\n\nOne victim of the syndrome - an FBI agent - told 60 Minutes about her experience of being hit by a powerful force at her home in Florida 2021.\n\n\"Bam, inside my right ear, it was like a dentist drilling on steroids,\" she told the programme. \"That feeling when it gets too close to your eardrum?

He says opposition claims of a dictatorship are smear campaigns and pure nonsense.\n\nHis chief rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition, has billed the vote as a referendum on the future direction of Turkey and has sought the support of nationalist voters to increase his chance of victory.\n\nSince 2017, Mr Erdogan has run Turkey with extensive presidential power, from a vast palace in Ankara. As executive president he can declare a state of emergency and can pick or dismiss civil servants.\n\nHe accuses his opponents of being \"pro-LGBT\", while his Islamist-rooted party positions itself as on the side of the family and highlights its success in modernising Turkey.\n\nIf he wins on Sunday, not much will change, says Selim Koru, a member of Turkey's Tepav think tank. His powers are already so broad he won't seek to extend them further, he says.\n\nBut Alp Yenen, lecturer in Turkish studies at Leiden University, believes if Turkey's rampant inflation of more than 43% endures, the president's AK Party could accelerate what has been \"a slow pace of authoritarianism\".\n\nThe man seeking to replace Mr Erdogan wants to scrap the presidential system brought in five years ago and return to a parliament and prime minister in charge. Independent courts and a free press would follow.\n\nPresident Erdogan acquired sweeping executive powers in the aftermath of the botched coup against him in 2016\n\nThe president would become apolitical and the other five parties in the Kilicdaroglu alliance would each have a vice president, along with the two centre-left mayors of Ankara and Istanbul.\n\nBut Mr Erdogan's party and its nationalist and conservative allies have secured a majority in parliament and if the opposition alliance were to win the presidency they might struggle to push through their reforms.\n\nTurkey is part of the West's Nato defensive alliance, but the Erdogan presidency has sought close ties with China and Russia too, buying a Russian S-400 air defence system and inaugurating a Russian-built nuclear plant - Turkey's first - ahead of the election.\n\nHe advocates a multilateral stance, viewing Turkey as \"an island of peace and security\", and offering Ankara as a mediator in the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\nHis opponent and his allies, meanwhile, want to return to the process of joining the European Union and restore Turkey's military ties with the US, while maintaining relations with Russia.\n\nIf Mr Erdogan stays in power then Selim Koru believes he will continue to push Turkey away from the West, without leaving Nato. \"He wants to get Turkey to a point in the medium term or distant future where Nato membership is irrelevant.\"\n\nThis election is being watched very carefully by 3.5 million Syrian refugees who have temporary protection in Turkey, because Kemal Kilicdaroglu wants to send them home fast.\n\nThat's a major worry for Syrians, who came here mainly in the first six years of the war until 2017.\n\nNot least because, after the opposition leader trailed in the first round, he made refugees and irregular migrants the number one issue of his campaign. He needs the vote of almost 2.8 million Turks who supported an ultranationalist candidate in the first round.\n\nHe has accused President Erdogan of bringing 10 million migrants into Turkey, and he is talking about Syrians, but Iranians, Afghans and Pakistanis too.\n\nMore than 80% of Turks want the Syrians to go home, and yet more than 700,000 Syrians are in Turkish schools and 880,000 Syrian babies have been born in Turkey since 2011.\n\n\"I cannot understand how they would leave this life and go back to Syria,\" says Prof Murat Erdogan, who conducts Syrians' Barometer, a regular field study on Syrians in Turkey.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu says he will negotiate the Syrians' return with Damascus, but as Syria insists on Turkey leaving its 30km (18-mile) buffer zone over the border, that runs the risk of Syria launching attacks on the zone and sparking a new wave of refugees.\n\nTurkey's government says more than half a million Syrian refugees have returned home, but the opposition wants more to leave\n\nThe opposition leader knows full well an agreement would take up to two years, and he would ask the United Nations to oversee it. But Murat Erdogan believes it could take a decade to implement.\n\nPresident Erdogan has sought to defuse the issue, by promising to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians through an agreement with President Bashar al-Assad. The idea of Syrians returning voluntarily seems far-fetched but Turkish state media reported that work on building 5,000 flats in Syria had already begun.\n\nTurkey's Kurds make up as much as a fifth of the 85 million population and they have a big stake in this election.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party, which attracted almost 9% of the parliamentary vote, publicly backed Kemal Kilicdaroglu for president and sees the vote as a historic moment to get rid of a \"one-man regime\".\n\nPresident Erdogan has accused him of surrendering to the \"blackmail\" and agenda of both the pro-Kurdish party and PKK militants, who are seen by Turkey and the West as terrorists.\n\nBut Kurdish voters are alarmed the opposition challenger has aligned himself with a far-right leader on fighting \"terrorism\", because that usually refers to Kurdish militants.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu has also agreed that Kurdish mayors can be replaced by trustees appointed by Ankara in so-called \"terror\" cases.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party's co-chair Pervin Buldan has fully backed the opposition leader, but that does not mean all Kurdish voters will follow suit.\n\n\"Getting the nationalist vote is a possibility but there's a risk in losing the Kurdish vote - it's a delicate balance - how do you get them without losing Kurds?\" asks Alp Yenen.\n\nAhead of the first round it was the state of Turkey's economy that was foremost in voters' minds, before the refugee issue came to the fore.\n\nInflation is officially 43.68%, and Turks have had a cost of living crisis far more severe than most. Many will tell you the real inflation rate feels far higher.\n\nThe early Erdogan years were a byword for strong economic growth and enormous construction projects. And Turkey always stuck closely to the terms of its loan agreements with the IMF.\n\nBut in recent years his government has abandoned orthodox economic policy. It gradually eroded the independence of the central bank, sacking three of its governors in quick succession, says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University.\n\nInflation soared, as interest rates were kept low - while Turkey's currency the lira depreciated to improve the trade balance and boost exports.\n\nOfficial inflation rates have fallen to 44% but Turks say the real inflation rate in shops and markets feels higher\n\nMr Erdogan still promises high growth, six million new jobs and a big push for tourism, but Prof Demiralp believes his policies will keep inflation as high as 45% for months to come.\n\nIf Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his allies win the presidency and parliament, she believes a return to orthodox economic policies and an independent central bank will lower inflation to 30% by the end of 2023 and it will continue to go down after that.", "The boy fell from the roof at Edinburgh Waverley railway station\n\nA 20-year-old man and 18-year-old woman have been charged after a boy was electrocuted in a fall at Edinburgh Waverley railway station.\n\nThe 16-year-old suffered serious injuries after falling from the roof on to overhead lines, near the entrance on Waverley Bridge.\n\nHe remains in hospital in a stable condition after the incident on 8 May.\n\nBritish Transport Police said the man and woman had been charged with culpable and reckless conduct.\n\nOfficers appealed for witnesses to the incident to contact them.\n\nA report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "When are you going to feel better off?\n\nHow politicians answer that big question sets the terms for the next election. The response is certainly not this week.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak might have told MPs \"we are halving inflation\" but repeating that political slogan in the Commons doesn't make it true. In fact he was wrong - just as economic sages were mistaken.\n\nPrices went up faster in February than in January - which came as a surprise to the experts. Interest rates edged up too and will make rent, mortgages and credit more expensive.\n\nThe message to workers, firms and families this week is bleak - your costs are going up but don't ask for a pay rise and don't put your prices up if you're a business.\n\nThere is no shortage of evidence of how hard it is for millions of families to pay the bills. By the Treasury's admission inflation \"strangles growth and erodes family budgets\".\n\nAnd its effects can be long-lasting. As one German economist said: \"Inflation is like toothpaste. Once it's out, you can hardly get it back in again.\"\n\nAs an aside, even that essential item has gone up significantly, with one famous brand hiking prices of a tube from \u00a33 to \u00a34.\n\nWhat the government hopes is that next month, and the month after that, and the month after that, the number crunchers are correct and inflation will drop pretty sharply by the end of the year and the toothpaste does, after all, go back in the tube.\n\nBut inflation slowing down doesn't mean prices will drop. What politicians and the public have to confront is that there could be many years where voters feel hard up.\n\nFor this week's show we asked Richard Hughes - the country's number cruncher in chief who runs the independent Office for Budget Responsibility - how he would answer that big question. If you're squeamish about your finances you might want to look away now.\n\nHe told me we're in the middle of \"the biggest squeeze on living standards we've faced in this country on record\" - but also it might be five or even six years before people start feeling more prosperous again.\n\nAs he put it: \"People's real spending power doesn't get back to the level it was before the pandemic even after five years, even by the time we get to the late 2020s.\" Gulp.\n\nThere is also a separate and tricky conversation to be had about the influence of his organisation, the OBR.\n\nTheir work, famously ignored by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng when they were in charge, tells governments how much they can spend and borrow if they want to stick to their own rules about when they will balance the country's books.\n\nThe idea is that with an independent body publicly checking ministers' arithmetic the public can have confidence in what's being done.\n\nBut their forecasts, as Mr Hughes happily admits, often turn out to be wrong, and change every six months. Yet they can have enormous influence over what politicians decide.\n\nFor example, several sources told me the government only decided to expand childcare in the recent Budget because the OBR told them more than half of the cost would be covered by the benefit of getting some parents back to work.\n\nYou can, as many politicians do, believe in the merits of having an independent expert cast their eye over the figures, but also have quiet concerns about how the OBR can draw the limits of political conversations when its forecasts - through no fault of its own - change dramatically.\n\nWhether you are asking an economist, a politician, or just looking at your own bank balance, the broad assessment is not likely to shift - times are tough for the foreseeable future.\n\nInflation - the politicians' nightmare - is likely to drop by the end of the year, but Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer are going to have to tempt you to the ballot box in 2024 when the country still feels hard up.\n\nWe can already see the outlines of the Conservatives' script. With inflation (they fervently hope) down and the economy (fingers crossed) avoiding recession there will, ministers believe, be signs the country's fortunes have turned and they can persuade hard-up voters to stick with them.\n\nAs one minister says: \"The argument we want to make is 'I'm just starting to feel better off, don't risk it'.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: So we just have to accept life will be even harder, chancellor?\n\nWe've lived through unprecedented hard times, they'll argue, and things are getting better so don't take a chance on something new.\n\nThe aspiration is also that ministers will be able to start cutting taxes again - perhaps in the autumn of this year or more likely next spring.\n\nOne former cabinet minister says voters will start to feel better off once a Conservative government is re-elected because they hope they'll be able to say during the campaign that \"inflation is lower, wages outstripping inflation\" and they have a \"clear plan for the economy\".\n\nEven if Rishi Sunak becomes an expert in political gymnastics it's unlikely the Conservatives will avoid taking any flak for the hammering incomes have taken while they've been in charge.\n\nBut you can expect in the next few months for ministers to emphasise more regularly the help that's already on offer - whether that's cheaper bus fares or the hugely expensive energy price guarantee.\n\nIf you ask Labour politicians when the country will feel better off the answer is also far in the future.\n\nOne shadow minister says the decline in living standards has been \"brutal\" while another says \"people are not going to feel better off for a very long time\".\n\nEven if inflation does start to slow, if you believe the polls that show Labour way ahead the tough economic reality for many families gives them a political advantage.\n\nHowever strongly the Conservatives argue they've had to deal with unprecedented pressures, hard-up voters do not tend to reward those in charge. But wise Labour heads are all too aware that successful oppositions don't just say \"we're not the other guys\".\n\nThat's why we're seeing the leadership put so much time and effort into trying to create a sense they would spend taxpayers' money wisely and talk repeatedly about how they would get the economy to grow.\n\nThe shadow minister believes Labour tends to win when it offers \"hope after years when the Tories look a bit clapped out\".\n\nSo when we ask \"when are you going to start feeling better off?\" the answer is \"not much, if at all, before the next election\".\n\nIt's likely that vote will happen when there is not much cash in our own pockets or the public purse.\n\nAnd we face a conversation where the Conservatives seize on any signs of progress to claim a change is not worth the risk while Labour highlights the hard times we have been living through and says it's time for something else.\n\nJust like economic forecasts, political predictions can turn out to be miles off. And of course, how we make a living and how the country pays its way is not the only factor determining how people vote.\n\nBut after years of hardship you'll be asked in the general election who you believe will help you be better off.\n\nThe answer millions of voters give will likely determine who takes No 10.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch the moment a man drives his Range Rover in front of an oncoming train\n\nA businessman had a close brush with disaster after he drove his Range Rover in front of an oncoming train.\n\nDalat Gulzar, 51, of Mill Lane, Chester, ignored signs and warning lights when he drove across the level crossing at Llanbedr station, Gwynedd.\n\nMold Crown Court heard heard he risked the lives of his and the train's passengers in a \"moment of absolute madness\".\n\nFollowing a trial Gulzar was banned from driving for 12 months.\n\nFootage played in court showed his black Range Rover driving across the train tracks, seemingly unaware of the approaching train on 19 June last year.\n\nShocked onlookers waiting to board the train from the station are seen holding their hands to their mouths as they witness the near miss.\n\nThe court heard the train's emergency brakes had to be applied.\n\nGulzar, of Mill Lane, Chester, pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving but was convicted by a jury.\n\nNathan Goldstein, defending, said his client was a \"hard working family man\" who experienced a \"moment of absolute madness\" that will have a profound effect upon his life.\n\nThe court heard Gulzar was of previous good character and that he would suffer as a result of a driving ban.\n\nIt was told he might have to close his business if he was unable to serve his customers.\n\nJudge Wyn Lloyd-Jones told Gulzar he had fallen below the standards of a careful and competent driver, and he could have caused \"serious injury or death\".\n\nSentencing him on Wednesday, the judge said: \"It's obvious the train driver who gave evidence suffered emotionally as a result of what unfolded before him.\n\n\"One of the things he said was this was one of the nearest misses he has had.\n\n\"CCTV from the train made for shocking viewing.\"\n\nGulzar was sentenced to a 12-month community order, ordered to carry out 120 hours unpaid work and to pay \u00a32,400 court costs.\n\nGulzar was also banned from from driving for 12 months.", "\"It's an absolute warzone here.\"\n\nThat's how the BBC reporter Tomos Morgan described the aftermath of a riot that broke out in Cardiff on Monday after two teenage boys died in a crash.\n\nCars were set alight and objects and fireworks were thrown at police as 100 to 150 people gathered in Ely.\n\nUp to 12 officers may also have been injured in the disorder, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said.", "A Nationwide advert featuring actor Dominic West that claimed the building society was not closing branches has been banned.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in fact that Nationwide had been closing branches.\n\nIt was also not clear enough that a Nationwide promise not to close any more would end in 2026, the watchdog added.\n\nOne of the complaints against the ads had been made by Santander.\n\nThe bank had been referenced in the ads, but said it had closed fewer branches than Nationwide in the year before the ad campaign.\n\nBanks have been closing branches for a number of decades. In the mid-1980s there were more than 21,000 branches, but this had more than halved by the 2020s.\n\nMore recently, banks have been saying that changing customer habits and increasing use of online banking have meant less demand.\n\nHowever, branch closures have hit many groups of people, including those with disabilities, older people, those living in rural areas, and small businesses, according to a recent House of Lords report.\n\nThe Nationwide ad campaign featured Dominic West as the boss of a fictional big bank who mocks customers while planning branch closures. Mr West has previously played Jimmy McNulty in popular series The Wire and Prince Charles in Netflix's runaway hit series, The Crown. The ads ran on TV, the radio, and in the press.\n\nIn the ad, the fictional bank is contrasted with Nationwide, with the slogan: \"Unlike the big banks we're not closing our branches.\"\n\nThe ads called out Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Bank of Scotland and Halifax, as well as Natwest, Barclays, Santander and HSBC.\n\nThe ads had 281 complainants, including from Santander, which said that Nationwide had recently closed or reduced opening hours at a number of branches, and challenged whether the ads were misleading.\n\nBy contrast, Nationwide closed two branches in 2023, but had closed 14 branches in the 12 months prior to the campaign.\n\nOver a 10-year period, Nationwide closed 152, or 20% of its branches. Although this was a smaller percentage than the competitors it called out in its ads, it was still a \"significant number\", the ASA said.\n\nIn addition, Nationwide made a \"branch promise\" in 2019 not to leave a town or city where there is a branch, unless there are \"circumstances outside of our control\".\n\nThe building society updated this in 2023, committing to not close any branches until at least 2026. It then extended that until 2028.\n\nThe ASA found the ads had not made it clear enough that this promise was potentially only short term.\n\nNationwide said: \"The investment we have made to keep branches open means we now have more than any other brand and are the last one standing in more than 90 communities.\"\n\nA spokesperson added that the building society was \"delighted to have the opportunity to make even clearer our now extended branch promise to keep every branch open until the start of 2028\".", "Mae Muller was the last to perform in the Eurovision running order - which is traditionally a tricky spot\n\nMae Muller came into Eurovision riding a wave of positivity.\n\nSam Ryder ended the UK's losing streak in Turin last year by doing the unthinkable - entering a decent song - and the thinking went: Why not do that again?\n\nMae obliged with a slick, sassy pop song that echoed recent chart trends. I Wrote A Song had the disco undercurrents of Dua Lipa, the lyrics were memorable, and it was eminently shareable on TikTok.\n\nThe public seemed to agree. Mae's song picked up tonnes of airplay, and more than eight million streams on Spotify. Bookmakers predicted she would finish in the top 10. Everyone from Ringo Starr to Lana Del Rey offered their support.\n\nIn the run-up to Eurovision, there was negative chatter about Mae's rehearsals. Her vocals were flat, insiders said, and the choreography was wooden.\n\nBut on the night, she brought out the big guns. Mae sang better than she'd done all week. Her dance moves were snappy and confident. The audience at the Liverpool Arena were ecstatic...\n\nAnd then it all went wrong.\n\nEurovision juries gave the song 15 points. The public awarded her nine. She ended the night in 25th place, out of 26.\n\nMae Muller reacts to the UK's low score in the Eurovision green room\n\n\"Undeserved. Very undeserved,\" said Eurovision fan Craig Andrew, who watched the horror unfold at Liverpool's Euroclub.\n\n\"I thought her vocal was flawless. She was so good on the night, but what can you do?\"\n\n\"I think it was much better than that, genuinely,\" agreed fellow fan Gaja Gazdic. \"In this crowd, it was very well received.\"\n\nGaja Gazdic travelled to Liverpool to support Mae in the contest\n\nThe first thing to remember is that no-one votes against you at Eurovision, they vote for the songs they like. And if your vibe is hyper-catchy, female-fronted pop, you were spoiled for choice.\n\nSweden's Loreen won the contest with the supersonic club anthem Tattoo - and Norway's Alessandra was close behind her in the public vote with Queen Of Kings, a thunderous pop anthem that was equal parts Lady Gaga and Nordic folklore.\n\nBoth of them were stronger singers, with stronger songs, than Mae, and they soaked up a lot of her potential votes.\n\nIn retrospect, there's also a peculiar Britishness to I Wrote A Song that might not have translated outside the UK.\n\nIt's a pithy, sarcastic track about taking revenge on an ex-boyfriend - not by trashing their car or burning their house down, but by writing an excoriating song about how rubbish they are.\n\nIn a contest where the top songs all featured sincere, straightforward messages about overcoming adversity and standing up for love, Mae's post-modern, meta-textual lyrics failed to find an audience.\n\nAustria's hotly tipped Who The Hell Is Edgar? took a similar approach and met a similar fate, coming 15th.\n\nComplexity simply isn't your friend when you've only got three minutes to make an impression.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIn the press room, questions were also raised about the concept underlying Mae's performance. In particular, the liberal use of wide shots and Pop Art video installations meant TV audiences couldn't always appreciate the singer's cheeky charisma.\n\n\"I think it's an excellent song, but the staging wasn't great,\" said Ken Olausson of Sweden's QX magazine.\n\n\"The whole feeling of female power that's in the song when you hear it on the radio, it wasn't on stage.\n\n\"I don't know if they lost her in a lot of props, but the power didn't come through.\"\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

But if it only just made your top 10, that's not how you win Eurovision.\"\n\nThe singer's staging was called into question\n\nAfter the results were announced, Mae took to Twitter to share her thoughts.\n\n\"I know I joke a lot, but we really put our all into the last few months,\" she said, \"Not the result we hoped for but so proud of everyone and what we achieved.\n\n\"Congrats to all the countries, I'll never forget this journey and I love you all.\"\n\nYou could feel her pain. She's been a great ambassador for Eurovision; and she kept up the UK's momentum of sending non-terrible songs to the contest. Some of the acts that placed ahead of her were objectively worse.\n\nSo what's next for the UK? Earlier this week, Radio 2's Eurovision commentators Scott Mills and Rylan Clark offered some perspective on the UK's Eurovision journey.\n\n\"It's impossible to repeat what happened last year, because it just doesn't happen,\" said Mills.\n\n\"But what we need to do is show Europe that we care and that we're taking it seriously. Mae is great, and while Europe used to say, 'Hang on a minute, why aren't the UK any good at this?' they're not saying that now.\"\n\nSwedish star Loreen became the first woman ever to win Eurovision twice, with her song Tattoo\n\n\"For reasons I've never been clear on, the host country tends to struggle with points after its success the previous year,\" observes Daniel Rosney.\n\nThat's especially true for Portugal: In 2017, in their 49th appearance at the contest, the country won for the first time, with Salvador Sobral's Amar Pelos Dois. The following year, they finished last.\n\n\"Things like that have always been a bit of an enigma,\" says Ricardo Duarte, who's been covering Eurovision for Portuguese queer website Dezanove.\n\n\"But we persevered. We continued. We did not qualify the year after - but we got 12th place in 2021 and ninth place in 2022.\n\n\"We've had our ups and downs, and so will every other country.\"\n\nAnd that's the message Mae and the team behind the BBC's Eurovision bid will need to bear in mind today. Outside the bubble of the contest, Mae's song has been a hit. She's a ready-made pop star, who just performed to a global TV audience of more than 160 million people.\n\nThis won't be the last we've heard of her.", "The asteroid will be visible from Earth through binoculars\n\nAn asteroid large enough to destroy a city has passed between the orbits of the Earth and the Moon - luckily for us, missing both.\n\nAs predicted by scientists, it passed within 175,000km of the Earth on Saturday after flying past the Moon.\n\nIt is rare for such a huge asteroid - estimated to be between 40 and 90m in diameter - to come so close to the planet.\n\nAstronomers described it as a once-in-a decade event.\n\nAccording to Nasa, it was an important opportunity for astronomers to increase their knowledge of asteroids, in the event that a dangerous object were discovered with the potential to hit Earth.\n\n\"There is no chance of this 'city killer' striking Earth, but its close approach offers a great opportunity for observations,\" said the European Space Agency's planetary defence chief, Richard Moissl.\n\nBut he added that more data was needed to determine the asteroid's composition.\n\nWith such a close pass of the Earth, the asteroid was visible through binoculars and small telescopes across the globe.\n\nA live web broadcast of its approach was provided by The Virtual Telescope Project.\n\nThe object looks set to return towards Earth's orbit in 2026, but scientists have ruled it out as a threat to the planet on that occasion, too.\n\nEarlier this month, a similarly sized asteroid, 2023 DW, was briefly given a one-in-432 chance of hitting Earth on Valentine's Day 2046.\n\nMoissl said 2023 DW was now expected to miss Earth by some 4.3 million km.\n\nEven if such an asteroid was determined to be heading our way, Earth is no longer defenceless.\n\nLast year, NASA's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft deliberately slammed into the pyramid-sized asteroid Dimorphos.\n\nBefore Dart's impact, it took Dimorphos 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit its larger parent asteroid, Didymos.", "\"I had hope that the British were coming to save us, but after a while I gave up hope,\" British national Einas Khojaly told the BBC's Tom Bateman upon arriving in Egypt.\n\nHer father -

legislation introduced after Brexit to ensure smooth trade across the UK.\n\nThe UK government granted this on Saturday, but it only covered PET plastic, aluminium and steel cans.\n\nThe drinks industry previously shared concerns about the scheme's readiness\n\nMinisters said they wanted to ensure the Scottish scheme \"aligned\" with plans in other nations.\n\nIn a letter to the first minister on Friday night, they said including glass \"would have created a potentially permanent divergence from the schemes planned for England and Northern Ireland\".\n\nProposals in Wales however still include glass bottles.\n\nHumza Yousaf accused the UK government of trying to \"sabotage\" the DRS in Scotland, as businesses had already signed up to and spent money on a scheme including glass.\n\nHe said he would have to hold urgent talks with businesses and examine the viability of the Scottish scheme.\n\nHumza Yousaf said UK ministers had \"demanded\" that glass be exempt from the scheme\n\nIn their 2019 manifesto, the UK Conservatives said they wanted a DRS that included glass - something Mr Golden said was \"common sense\".\n\nOn Sunday the MSP said schemes work best \"when you're encouraging consistent consumer behaviour\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland, he said: \"Since the position four years ago what we've seen is that industry has lost support for the scheme in Scotland.\n\n\"Consumers are increasingly concerned and ultimately what I'm proposing is that we salvage the scheme. I think from listening to businesses that unfortunately does not include glass at this stage.\"\n\nHe added that Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater, who has been driving the introduction of the DRS in Scotland, had \"turned her back\" on a re-melting target.\n\nHe said this would lead to glass going into aggregate instead of back into bottles.\n\nHowever Circularity Scotland, which is in charge of administering the DRS, said this claim was \"entirely untrue\" as it had its own target for 90% of recycled glass to be used in glass-making.\n\nLorna Slater said excluding glass was a last minute change of the goal posts\n\nMeanwhile Mr Golden said the scheme in Wales still included glass because the Welsh government had not applied for any exemption to start the DRS ahead of 2025.\n\nMs Slater told the BBC's Sunday Politics show UK's position would also have implications for the Welsh plans.\n\nShe said: \"Rishi Sunak, Alistair Jack even Douglas Ross all stood for election in 2019 on a manifesto that promised a deposit return scheme with glass. Now they have decided to remove glass from England's scheme alone, which is a change from what we had all agreed as four nations.\n\n\"Wales has yet to pass their regulations and I feel that it is likely that they would come up against exactly the same issues we've had.\n\n\"We have been working very well with the UK government all this time. This is a bit of a shock for them to suddenly move the goal posts on us at the last minute.\"\n\nThe British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) has said the \"only viable option now\" was for a UK-wide initiative to be launched across all four nations in 2025.\n\nThe deposit return scheme is the latest policy which sees the Scottish and UK governments butting heads.\n\nFor people not involved in day-to-day politics, it's perhaps hard to understand why it functions so easily in, say, Germany - but yet seems impossible to work in Scotland.\n\nCross-border trade is the issue - and there being no blocks to that.\n\nDRS can go ahead - but without glass, say UK ministers.\n\nThe Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said in 2019 that including glass was \"common sense\", but industry's now turned its back on that.\n\nEngland and Northern Ireland won't be including glass in 2025 - Wales want to but Mr Golden told me they've not asked for an exemption request from the UK government.\n\nIt maybe now sounds like if they do, they won't get it.\n\nIf you're drinking from the pro-independence bottle you're probably frustrated by the UK government and think Scotland should go it alone.\n\nIf it's the pro-union bottle, you probably think a UK-wide scheme is much more sensible.\n\nIt all comes down to your favourite tipple.", "The current exam system was described as \"no longer fit for purpose\"\n\nA radical review of school qualifications in Scotland is to be published before the end of the month.\n\nThe review was commissioned by the Scottish government to look at how well the system is working after Standard Grades were abolished 10 years ago.\n\nThere is speculation it could recommend an end to exams for fourth year pupils and for some qualifications.\n\nPupils could be assessed on coursework and receive qualifications that recognise extra-curricular activities.\n\nThe review is being chaired by the academic Louise Hayward and was always expected to be \"bold\" in its thinking.\n\nThe interim report, published in March, said the current exam system was \"no longer fit for purpose\".\n\nNational 4 and 5 qualifications, normally taken by 15 and 16-year-olds, were introduced in 2013/14.\n\nThere are two distinct questions: should there be exams for particular qualifications, and when should students sit exams for the first time?\n\nThere is a long-standing argument that senior students sit too many exams - and that by removing exams in S4, students could spend more time working towards obtaining their first formal qualifications the following year, at the end of S5.\n\nThe review is also likely to address whether there is even a need for National 4 qualifications or exams for National 5 candidates.\n\nThere are no exams for National 4 qualifications and some contend that National 5s could also be obtained through coursework and continuing assessment.\n\nAny fundamental changes to the qualification system would be a decision for Scottish government ministers and parliament.\n\nWhen the new qualifications system was introduced, a handful of schools decided not to routinely present students for exams in S4.\n\nAt Hermitage Academy in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, this proved hugely controversial and pressure from parents led to their reintroduction.\n\nMinisters are likely to seek the views of parents and employers - as well as education professionals - before they contemplate any fundamental changes.\n\nA government spokesperson told BBC Scotland: \"The recommendations of the final report will be carefully considered and the Scottish government will respond in due course.\"\n\nJenny Gilruth has said Scotland needed to \"future-proof our qualifications\"\n\nShe said there was a need to \"future-proof our qualifications\" and they may look \"radically different\" in the future, adding it was essential that pupils were assessed continuously throughout the academic year.\n\nScotland's education and exams agencies are already to be scrapped and replaced by the summer of 2024 after another report said there was too much focus on exams in schools.\n\nThe overhaul will include government bodies Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), Education Scotland and a separate school inspection agency.\n\nPupils across Scotland are currently waiting for the results of this year's written exams, to be published on 8 August. They were the last of three years of altered assessments designed to mitigate disruption caused by Covid.\n\nThe SQA said its grading would be \"sensitive\" this year because of the continuing impact of the pandemic.\n\nIt has taken similar steps to last year to help students, such as removing or reducing exams or elements of coursework, but plans for exams to go fully back to normal next year.", "Sam Altman testified before a US Senate Committee about the potential of artificial intelligence - and its risks\n\nThe creator of advanced chatbot ChatGPT has called on US lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, testified before a US Senate committee on Tuesday about the possibilities - and pitfalls - of the new technology.\n\nIn a matter of months, several AI models have entered the market.\n\nMr Altman said a new agency should be formed to license AI companies.\n\nChatGPT and other similar programmes can create incredibly human-like answers to questions - but can also be wildly inaccurate.\n\nMr Altman, 38, has become a spokesman of sorts for the burgeoning industry.

What we can't really quantify is the scale of progress and whether or not they have had a significant breakthrough.\n\nI left the CCTV viewing suite with the overriding impression that this is a resource hungry investigation.\n\nIt is clearly going to take a long time to build a case or indeed cases given the number of people the PSNI believe were involved.\n\nTo date, 15 people have been arrested and there have been 40 searches of premises and land.\n\nMore than 340 witnesses have been interviewed so far.\n\nTwo Ford Fiesta cars used in the attack had been bought about 70 miles away, in Glengormley and Ballyclare, County Antrim, weeks prior to be used in the shooting.\n\nThey were found burned out following the attack.\n\nAttempting to trace their movements has meant obtaining footage from hundreds of cameras spread over a large area.\n\nThis car near a farmyard on the Racolpa Road outside Omagh is thought to have been used by the gunmen and was later burnt out\n\nDetectives are poring over the material in several viewing rooms within a Belfast police base.\n\n\"All the detectives working on the case know the importance of CCTV and the fact that a 15 or 20-second piece of footage could be crucial in building a case,\" said Det Ch Supt Corrigan.\n\n\"An attack of this nature is carried out by multiple people who are organised.\n\n\"We are looking for movements of people and vehicles over time. It is time consuming and a lot of patience is required,\" he added.\n\nThe New IRA has admitted responsibility for the attack, but police believe a crime gang may have aided it.\n\nDet Ch Insp Caldwell has run investigations into both paramilitary groups and organised crime gangs.\n\n\"Whether these people are members of a terrorist organisation or an organised crime organisation, this has been an attack on a serving police officer at the behest of the New IRA,\" Det Ch Supt Corrigan said.\n\n\"How they carry out their operations and support them logistically is not for me to decide.\n\n\"I will follow the evidence and bring people who are responsible before the courts.\"", "Watch as Manchester City players bump into Elton John at the airport and serenade him with a rendition of Your Song after their 2-1 FA Cup final victory over Manchester United at Wembley.\n\nWATCH MORE: All the angles of Gundogan's stunning FA Cup final volley", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Lorna Slater says 'no option but to delay' Deposit Return Scheme\n\nThe deposit return scheme in Scotland is to be delayed until October 2025 at the earliest.\n\nThe flagship recycling scheme was supposed to launch in March next year.\n\nBut Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater said she had been left with no choice after the UK government excluded glass from the Scottish scheme.\n\nShe said she remained committed to introducing the recycling scheme - although it will be more limited than originally intended.\n\nThe delay means that the Scottish scheme is likely to launch at the same time as similar proposals for other parts of the UK - as many retailers and drinks companies had been calling for.\n\nWhen it is finally introduced, the deposit return scheme (DRS) will see a 20p charge placed on drinks containers which would be refunded to consumers when they return the bottles and cans in a bid to increase recycling levels.\n\nLarger stores, shopping centres and community hubs will operate reverse vending machines for people to return their containers.\n\nMs Slater said: \"The overwhelming feedback from producers, retailers and hospitality is that they cannot prepare for a March launch based on the changes being required by the UK government without any certainty even about what those changes would be\".\n\nShe added: \"As of today, it is now clear that we have been left with no other option than to delay the launch of Scotland's DRS until October 2025 at the earliest based on the UK government's current stated aspirations.\n\n\"I remain committed to interoperable DRS schemes across the UK provided that we can work in a spirit of collaboration not imposition.\n\n\"Scotland will have a deposit return scheme. It will come later than need be. It will be more limited than it should be and more limited than parliament voted for\".\n\nMs Slater is a co-leader of the Scottish Greens, and has a ministerial post under her party's power sharing agreement with the SNP in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nKat Jones, director of Action to Protect Rural Scotland, which has campaigned for a DRS, said: \"This is a bleak day for anyone who cares about Scotland's litter crisis, or indeed the global climate crisis.\"\n\nShe also raised doubts about whether the UK government will be able to introduce a DRS for England by October 2025 - describing that date as being \"at best provisional\".\n\nThe scheme is now likely to launch at the same time as similar proposals for other parts of the UK\n\nThe UK government approved a partial exemption to the Internal Market Act for the Scottish deposit scheme last week, but said glass bottles would need to be excluded.\n\nIt said this was to bring Scotland into line with similar schemes that are due to launch in England and Northern Ireland in October 2025, which will also not include glass.\n\nThe exemption means that the Scottish deposit return scheme would only be allowed to cover PET plastic, aluminium and steel cans.\n\nGlass is still included in proposals for a Welsh scheme, with the Welsh government having not yet asked for an exemption.\n\nCircularity Scotland, the company set up to run the Scottish DRS, said there was no reason why it could not launch in March 2024 without including glass and that it was \"disappointed\" by Ms Slater's announcement.\n\nIts chief executive, David Harris, said: \"Further delaying the introduction of DRS will hinder Scotland's progress towards net zero and mean that billions of drinks containers continue to end up as waste.\"The board of Circularity Scotland will now consider the impact of this announcement and our immediate priority will be communicating with our people. We will provide further updates in due course.\"\n\nSeveral major retailers and drinks companies, including Tesco and Tennents, had already called for Scotland to join a UK-wide initiative rather than introduce its own scheme a year earlier than everyone else.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said the announcement was the \"final admission that Scotland's deposit return scheme has met its inevitable demise\".\n\nIts Scotland policy chairman, Andrew McRae, said: \"The delay until a UK-wide scheme has taken shape will give much-needed breathing space for the small producers and retailers who have spent months wrestling with the implications of DRS for their operations.\"\n\nThe UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, welcomed the announcement that the Scottish scheme would now start at the same time as the UK government's proposals were introduced.\n\nHe added: \"Deposit return schemes need to be consistent across the whole of the UK, to provide a simple and effective system for businesses and consumers.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the Scottish government, and the other devolved administrations, on a UK-wide deposit return solution.\"\n\nMs Slater had to apply for an exemption to the Internal Market Act because of UK government concerns that the Scottish scheme would effectively introduce trade barriers in different parts of the UK if it was introduced first and had different rules to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Scottish Licensed Trader's Association has previously likened Ms Slater's approach to \"building a 20-storey skyscraper then applying for retrospective planning permission\".\n\nMs Slater revealed last month that businesses in Scotland have spent about \u00a3300m preparing for the introduction of the DRS, and there have been suggestions that many could seek compensation from the government now that it will not be introduced until much later than anticipated.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the Scottish DRS had \"already failed long before any intervention from the UK government\" and that a great deal of time and effort could have been saved if the SNP and Greens had listened businesses calling for a UK-wide approach.\n\nScottish Labour MSP Boyack accused the Scottish and UK governments of being \"more interested in a constitutional fight\" than making the recycling scheme work, and said Scotland was \"paying the price for two bad governments\".\n\nThe DRS was originally due to launch in Scotland in July of last year but had already been delayed twice amid concern about its implementation from many businesses which would be affected.\n\nWe now have confirmation of what was starting to feel inevitable. Scotland's deposit return scheme won't start next March - it will be operating by October 2025 at the earliest.\n\nThe logic behind that date is that it's when the UK government wants to have its own scheme.\n\nThere's been a long-running argument about glass being excluded from the Scottish scheme. But this, Lorna Slater told MSPs, was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nShe argued that more \"sabotage\" came via other UK government conditions: such as one administration fee and one logo for the schemes that will (eventually) operate across all of the UK.\n\nBut this is about more than how beer bottles, cartons and juice cans are recycled. This is about how devolution works.\n\nScottish ministers feel that the UK government has thwarted plans to introduce legislation in an area where they have responsibility.\n\nThe UK government argues that their approach is sensible. If all UK schemes are to align at a later point, then they say they have to ensure certain conditions are put into place in Scotland now.\n\nMany businesses may be less concerned with who's to blame, and more concerned with the money and time spent preparing for a project that's now been kicked into the long grass.", "Last updated on .From the section Snooker\n\nEngland's Mark King has been suspended from the World Snooker Tour while an investigation is carried out into reports of irregular betting patterns.\n\nThe World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) is looking into reports around King's 4-0 defeat by Joe Perry at February's Welsh Open.\n\nThe WPBSA said King was barred from \"attending or competing\" on the tour with \"immediate effect\".\n\nThe 48-year-old world number 57 has the right to appeal against the decision.\n\n\"The suspension will remain in place until the conclusion of the investigation or any subsequent charges that may or may not be brought,\" the WPBSA added.\n\nKing turned professional in 1991 and reached a career-high world ranking of 11 in 2003, with his only ranking title coming at the Northern Ireland Open in 2016.\n\u2022 None The rise and fall of the jeweller-turned-criminal: Listen to Gangster: The Story of John Palmer\n\u2022 None Watch Saving Lives in Leeds on BBC iPlayer now", "There is nothing suspicious about the misspelling Cobain's name\n\nA guitar smashed by Kurt Cobain, the late frontman of US rock band Nirvana, has sold at auction for nearly $600,000 (\u00a3480,000).\n\nThe broken black Fender Stratocaster had been expected to sell for a tenth of that amount at Saturday's auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York.\n\nCobain, who took his own life in 1994, was known for his intense performances.\n\nThe guitar was destroyed as Nirvana were working on their break-out album Nevermind in the early 1990s.\n\nIt has been put back together but is no longer playable.\n\nThe instrument is signed by all three band members in a silver marker.

But he said the city, where the war's longest and bloodiest battle has raged since August, was \"not occupied\" by Russia \"as of today\".\n\n\"There are no two or three interpretations of those words,\" he added, after earlier confusion about his remarks on the status of the city.\n\nIt was in a video posted on Saturday that Wagner's Mr Prigozhin claimed his fighters - who have led the Russian assault on Bakhmut - were in full control of the city.\n\nMr Zelensky compared Bakhmut to Hiroshima, which was hit by an atomic bomb in World War Two, promising a similar \"reconstruction\" of his country.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, he visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida - whose relatives died when the United States dropped the bomb on the city in 1945.\n\nMr Zelensky laid a wreath for those who were killed in the attack.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky and Japanesee PM Fumio Kishida visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park\n\nAfter a meeting with Mr Kishida, he strode into an auditorium at the peace park to speak to reporters.\n\nAs he entered, one journalist shouted from the back of the room: \"Slava Ukraini\" (glory to Ukraine). Mr Zelensky nodded to acknowledge her.\n\nHe drew several parallels between Hiroshima and Ukraine, saying that pictures of the Japanese city in ruins after bombing reminded him of present-day Bakhmut. He vowed there would be a similar \"reconstruction and recovery\" of Ukraine.\n\n\"Now Hiroshima has rebuilt their city, and we dream of rebuilding our cities,\" he said.\n\nThere had earlier been some confusion about the status of Bakhmut, after Mr Zelensky said \"today Bakhmut is only in our hearts\".\n\nHis office later clarified that he had not said that the city had fallen.\n\nBut Russian fighters at least control most of Bakhmut. Wagner mercenaries have concentrated their efforts there for months, and their relentless, costly tactic of sending in waves of men seems to have gradually eroded Kyiv's resistance.\n\nUkrainian forces have resisted calls for a tactical withdrawal to this point, but say that if they did pull out it would be a \"Pyrrhic victory\" for the Russians.\n\nMr Zelensky also alluded to his troops continuing to carry out \"important work\" in the area.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's ground forces later said Kyiv's forces were making advances on the outskirts of Bakhmut and were getting closer to a \"tactical encirclement\" of the city.\n\nGen Oleksandr Syrskyi added that he had visited troops on the frontline.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) appeared to corroborate Gen Syrskyi's claims, writing in a ground report that \"geolocated footage\" showed a Ukrainian brigade \"striking unspecified Russian forces south of Klishchiivka, 7km south-west of Bakhmut\".\n\nAnalysts say the city is of little strategic value to Moscow, but its capture would be a symbolic victory for Russia after the longest battle of the war in Ukraine so far.\n\nHowever, when Russia fought fiercely to claim the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk last summer, Ukraine soon reclaimed swathes of territory elsewhere.\n\nIt will no doubt be hoping to use a similar strategy for an anticipated counter-offensive this year.\n\nIn a separate piece of analysis, the ISW said Wagner had only been able to continue its sustained attack on Bakhmut City after \"Russian regular forces\" took responsibility for the flanks.\n\nIf Mr Prigozhin, Wagner's leader, sticks to his word and withdraws his forces from Bakhmut in the coming days, \"Russian conventional forces will be even more unlikely to pursue [other] offensive operations,\" the ISW added.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has dominated the three-day summit of G7 leaders in Japan, with Mr Zelensky meeting with several world leaders to lobby for more support.\n\nHis persistence paid off. At the summit, the US announced it would allow its Western allies to supply Ukraine with advanced fighter jets, including American-made F-16s.\n\nHowever, as yet no country has committed to supplying the jets to Ukraine.\n\nAsked by the BBC how confident he was about getting F-16s from his allies, Mr Zelensky said: \"We will be working on that, I'm sure\u2026 I cannot tell you how many - this is not a secret, we really don't know.\"\n\nThe BBC also asked him when his delayed spring counter-offensive would begin.\n\n\"Russia will feel when we have a counter-offensive,\" he replied.\n\u2022 None Defending the last Ukrainian streets in Bakhmut", "Jacqueline Gold, who transformed the lingerie and sex toy chain Ann Summers and was a champion of women in business, has died aged 62.\n\nHer family said she died on Thursday evening after seven years of treatment for breast cancer.\n\nMs Gold expanded Ann Summers from a firm with four backstreet shops into a multi-million pound business.\n\nShe was made a CBE in 2016 for services to entrepreneurship, women in business and social enterprise.\n\nMs Gold's family said: \"It is with unspeakable sadness that Ann Summers confirm our amazing executive chair Jacqueline Gold CBE passed away yesterday evening with her husband Dan, daughter Scarlett, sister Vanessa, and brother-in-law Nick, by her side.\n\n\"She was... an activist for women in business, and championed female entrepreneurs with the ambition to better the working environment for women,\" the statement added.\n\nHer death comes just two months after her father, David Gold, who was joint-chairman of West Ham United, died at the age of 86.\n\nHer sister Vanessa, who is chief executive at Ann Summers, said: \"She was a trailblazer, a visionary, and the most incredible woman, all of which makes this news that much harder to bear.\"\n\nThe first Ann Summers shop opened in 1971, and the business was bought by Ms Gold's father and his brother Ralph the following year.\n\nMs Gold first joined her family's firm as an intern, but transformed the Ann Summers brand by making it more female-friendly.\n\nBut she told the BBC in 2015 that when she first proposed this approach to the company's all-male directors it wasn't well received.\n\n\"One board member threw down his pen and said 'this isn't going to work, women aren't interested in sex',\" she said.\n\nShe set up a new Tupperware-style party service solely for women, which proved an immediate hit.\n\nThe increase in sales that her approach generated led to expansion of Ann Summers' High Street stores. It currently has 88 across the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe revamped stores were brightly lit and again targeted at women, with the aim of distinguishing them from the traditional image of backstreet sex shops.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"When I joined Ann Summers its customer profile was only 10% women, today it remains 100% women going to our parties, and 80% women to our stores.\n\n\"I always say that I have taken the company from the raincoat brigade to a female institution.\"\n\nAs well as running the business, Ms Gold mentored other female entrepreneurs and lobbied the government to help improve gender equality in business.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday Times in 2018, she said there were very few female role models, adding that she found it \"disappointing\" that the situation had not changed.\n\n\"I am frustrated that we are still having the same conversation around female empowerment and equality,\" she told the paper. \"We live in a fast-paced society and yet progress is painfully slow.\"", "The government has defended its rollout of free childcare hours after Labour called the system a \"total mess\".\n\nThe scheme is being expanded in phases, with 15 hours of free childcare now available for working parents of two year olds.\n\nRishi Sunak called it a \"positive and exciting moment\", while Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said 150,000 families had already registered.\n\nBut Labour said last week it would not commit to the plans.\n\nLabour has said it does not believe the current plans will be able to provide enough extra places, but said it was committed to the \"real opportunity\" of reforming childcare.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Keegan said the government was \"working all across the country to make sure we build the capacity to cope with the demand\".\n\nThe prime minister also appeared on BBC Radio Tees on Tuesday morning, where he said the government's \"methodical\" rollout was working.\n\n\"We said this is a really big change and we need to take the time to get it right, to give time for the sector to grow and expand,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"And if you look, that is working. Staffing levels in the sector have increased, and the number of places has also increased over the past year as well.\"\n\nFor working parents of three and four year olds, 30 hours of childcare funded by government is already available, and the expansion of the cover is being rolled out in these phases:\n\nTo qualify for the new hours, the majority of parents must earn more than \u00a38,670, but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.\n\nThe rollout is expected to cause a rise in demand, but the number of available places actually fell slightly in 2023 as childminders told the BBC they felt forced out of the sector due to a lack of pay and appreciation.\n\nAccording to the Coram Family and Childcare charity, the availability of nursery and childminder places has worsened for all ages of pre-school children across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nIt says fewer than a third of councils (29%) had enough spaces for under-twos in 2024, down from 42% in 2023.\n\nLast week, shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said Labour had commissioned a review of the government's \u00a34bn expansion of its childcare policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, shadow cabinet office minister Pat McFadden said Labour would not reverse the expansion of free childcare to two years olds, saying his party was \"not proposing to take anyone's entitlement away\".\n\nHe said it was a \"good aim to expand childcare provision\", but said his party had concerns about supply being able to meet demand.\n\nMs Keegan said the government had used a phased rollout \"to make it deliverable\" and added there were 13,000 more staff working in the sector than last year.\n\nThe government consulted thousands of businesses, she said, to ensure the plans were sustainable.\n\nBut childcare providers across the country have previously raised concerns about being able to deliver extra places.\n\nSamantha Hinds, who runs Daisy Chain Day Nursery in Peterborough, said she has had to turn some families away because they do not have enough staff.\n\nShe called it a \"beautiful job\", but said the cost-of-living crisis and poor wages were putting people off from working in the sector.\n\nIn Bolton, Julie Robinson, who runs Eagley School House nurseries, said the expansion would be \"hugely challenging\" as she already has long waiting lists for places.\n\nDespite employing 60 staff across two sites in Greater Manchester, she said she was \"struggling month on month\" to fund her running costs, business rates and wages.", "Former US President Donald Trump has filed a court notice of appeal two days after a civil trial found he sexually abused a woman, E Jean Carroll, in a New York department store.\n\nA New York jury awarded Ms Carroll nearly $5m in damages over her allegation that Mr Trump attacked her in the 1990s.\n\nJurors found Mr Trump, 76, liable for battery and defamation, but not rape.\n\nHis appeal comes a day after the former president called his accuser a \"wack job\" during a CNN town hall event.\n\n\"I swear on my children, which I never do.

Millions of people spent days under red alerts for extreme heat.\n\nExperts say extreme heat can be a very serious threat to life, especially among the elderly. According to one study, more than 61,000 people were estimated to have died from heat-related causes during last year's heatwaves in Europe.\n\n\"This study confirms what we knew before. It shows again just how much climate change plays a role in what we are currently experiencing,\" said Friederike Otto from Imperial College London.\n\nClimate scientists say decades of humans pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are causing global temperatures to rise.\n\nBut not all extreme weather events can immediately be linked directly to climate change because natural weather patterns can also play a part.\n\nScientists in the UK, US and Netherlands in the World Weather Attribution group studied the recent heatwaves to identify the fingerprint of climate change.\n\nUsing computer models, they simulated a world without the effects of emissions pumped into the atmosphere to the real-world temperatures seen during the heatwaves.\n\nThe North American heatwave was 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) hotter and the heatwave in China was 1\u00b0C hotter because of climate change, the scientists concluded.\n\nThe world has warmed 1.1C compared to the pre-industrial period before humans began burning fossil fuels.\n\nIf temperature rise reaches 2C, which many experts warn is very likely as countries fail to reduce their emissions quickly enough, these events will occur every two to five years, the scientists say.\n\nThe study also considered the role of El Ni\u00f1o, a naturally occurring powerful climate fluctuation that began in June. It leads to higher global temperatures as warm waters rise to the surface in the tropical Pacific ocean and push heat into the air.\n\nThe study concluded that El Ni\u00f1o probably played a small part but that increased temperatures from burning fossil fuels was the main driver in the more intense heatwaves.\n\nA run of climate records have fallen in recent weeks, including global average temperatures and sea surface temperatures particularly in the North Atlantic.\n\nExperts say the speed and timing is \"unprecedented\" and warn that more records could tumble in the coming weeks and months.\n\nDangerous wildfires in Greece forced thousands of people to evacuate hotels at the weekend.

Watch: What will happen when Trump is arrested\n\nAs the first former US president to face criminal charges, Donald Trump will also be the first to be fingerprinted, taken for a mugshot and brought before a judge.\n\nIf the case proceeds as expected, he will be the first US president to sit before a jury.\n\nAlready the shockwaves are spreading across the political landscape.\n\nSome aspects are predictable - the former president, his lawyers and his children are denouncing the yet-to-be-detailed charges as political persecution.\n\nThey see it as an attempt to disrupt the campaign of a frontrunner for the presidency in 2024.\n\nAt Mr Trump's political rally in Texas last Saturday, the former president was already fixated on an arrest that seemed to be looming.\n\n\"This is really prosecutorial misconduct,\" Mr Trump said of the New York City district attorney's inquiry. \"The innocence of people makes no difference to these radical left maniacs.\"\n\nAs the news broke, other members of the Republican Party closed ranks around their former president.\n\nSeveral senior members of the House of Representatives called the indictment \"outrageous\" and pledged a thorough congressional investigation.\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said the New York district attorney had \"irreparably damaged\" the nation in an attempt to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSeveral of Mr Trump's potential rivals for the Republic nomination condemned the charges.\n\n\"Prosecuting serious crimes keeps Americans safe, but political prosecutions put the American legal system at risk of being viewed as a tool for abuse,\" former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nMike Pompeo (C) made reference to 'political persecutions' in a statement after the indictment\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, viewed as Mr Trump's most formidable potential opponent, was equally strident in a Twitter post, calling the indictment \"un-American\".\n\n\"The weaponisation of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that Florida would not assist in an extradition of Mr Trump to New York to face the charges.\n\nMr Trump's lawyers have previously said he would go to the courthouse willingly - something expected to happen early next week.\n\nAt some point, however, Mr Trump's rivals will have to turn on him - and a lower-profile potential candidate may have given a hint of the strategy in his Thursday evening press release.\n\n\"It is a dark day for America when a former president is indicted on criminal charges,\" former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said, noticeably not calling the indictment unjust.\n\nDonald Trump has surged in Republican approval polls recently, but there is still sentiment that his drama - the political storm clouds that always seem to follow him - is a liability that will make him a less appealing presidential candidate.\n\nFor that line of attack, this indictment could become Exhibit A, noted by his Republican opponents more with sadness than with glee.\n\nDonald Trump has been considered the man to beat for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024\n\nFor its part, the Trump campaign is leaning into the controversy, using the front-page headlines and breaking news bulletins to drum up new donations from supporters.\n\n\"Please make a contribution - of truly any amount - to defend our movement from the never-ending witch hunts and WIN the WHITE HOUSE in 2024,\" read a campaign email that included Mr Trump's press release on the indictment. It promised that the indictment would \"backfire\" on President Joe Biden and the Democrats.\n\nAt least so far, the White House has been keeping a studious silence on the matter - similar to the strategy it employed during Mr Trump's 2021 Senate impeachment trial after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTheir view, perhaps, aligns with the old Napoleon quote about not interrupting an enemy when they're making a mistake.\n\nOther Democrats, however, have been less reticent.\n\n\"The bedrock of our legal system is the principle that justice applies to everyone equally,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker said in a statement. \"No-one is above the law.\"\n\nSenator Cory Booker is among the Democrats arguing that nobody - even presidents - is above the law\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's press secretary tried to link Mr Trump and his legal troubles to the former president's \"Make America Great Again\" movement and the Republican Party as a whole.\n\nDemocrats, and many political analysts, attribute the party's better-than-expected performance in last year's mid-term elections to Republican candidates being too closely associated with a former president who, while still loved by many Republicans, is disliked by a majority of Americans.\n\nExpect Democrats to once again employ a similar line of attack.\n\nMr Trump's current legal drama may reach a crescendo and conclude well before a vote is cast in 2024. The political fallout could ultimately depend on the course it tracks - and whether this case is joined by others.\n\nFor the moment, however, the partisan lines on Mr Trump's indictment are clearly drawn - as they have been on almost every major issue of national importance in America today.", "Meta has said it will begin to restrict news on its platforms to Canadian consumers after parliament passed a controversial online news bill.\n\nThe bill forces big platforms to compensate news publishers for content posted on their sites.\n\nMeta and Google have both already been testing limiting access to news to some Canadians.\n\nIn 2021, Australian users were blocked from sharing or viewing news on Facebook in response to a similar law.\n\nCanada's Online News Act, which cleared the senate on Thursday, lays out rules requiring platforms like Meta and Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news organisations for their content.\n\nMeta has called the law \"fundamentally flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work\".\n\nOn Thursday, it said news availability will be ended on Facebook and Instagram for all users in Canada - before the bill takes effect.\n\n\"A legislative framework that compels us to pay for links or content that we do not post, and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platforms, is neither sustainable nor workable,\" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nThe company said the changes to news would not have an impact on other services for Canadian users.\n\nGoogle called the bill \"unworkable\" in its current form and said it was seeking to work with the government to find a \"path forward\".\n\nThe federal government says the online news bill is necessary \"to enhance fairness in the Canadian digital news market\" and to allow struggling news organisations to \"secure fair compensation\" for news and links shared on the platforms.\n\nAn analysis of the bill by an independent parliament budget watchdog estimated news businesses could receive about C$329m ($250m; \u00a3196m) per year from digital platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told Reuters the tests being run by the tech platforms were \"unacceptable\" and a \"threat\".\n\nIn Australia, Facebook restored news content to its users after talks with the government led to amendments.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Rodriguez's office said he had met both Google and Facebook this week and planned further discussions - but the government would move forward with the bill's implementation.\n\n\"If the government can't stand up for Canadians against tech giants, who will?\" he said in a statement.\n\nMedia industry groups hailed the bill's passage as a step towards market fairness.\n\n\"Real journalism, created by real journalists, continues to be demanded by Canadians and is vital to our democracy, but it costs real money,\" said Paul Deegan, president and chief executive officer of News Media Canada, a media industry group, said in a statement\n\nThe Online News Act is expected to take effect in Canada in six months.", "Nina Skorkina has now left her village near the border with Russia\n\nWhen Russian planes began bombing her border village in northern Ukraine, Nina Skorkina refused to leave.\n\nThen a police team arrived and evacuated the 87-year-old anyway, with explosions all around.\n\nIn recent days, other elderly and frail residents have been carried out on blankets across a bridge already damaged by air strikes.\n\nAs Vladimir Putin celebrates securing another six years in the Kremlin, and vows to continue his full-scale war on Ukraine, attacks across the border have sharply escalated.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky says nearly 200 bombs have been dropped on the Sumy region in north-eastern Ukraine this month alone.\n\nHe accuses Russia of trying to \"burn our border villages to the ground\".\n\nNina Makarenko was evacuated to a safer town, with just a few clothes and her own jam\n\nPolice and emergency workers have now rescued hundreds of people from the Sumy border area, moving them deeper into Ukraine and to safety.\n\nMany are from a cluster of villages around Velyka Pysarivka.\n\nHelped off a bright yellow school bus this week, Nina Makarenko told me the home she'd had to leave was in ruins.\n\n\"They smashed up our houses.

Images filmed by police rescue teams show streets of detached houses in utter ruin.\n\nUkrainians say entire streets in border villages have been destroyed by Russian bombardment\n\nOne possible reason for the upsurge in attacks is increased Ukrainian shelling of Belgorod, the biggest Russian city across the border.\n\nVladimir Putin has vowed to respond, ignoring the fact that Russian missiles have been hitting homes and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine relentlessly for two years.\n\nThe mayor of Okhtyrka has another theory for the escalation.\n\n\"I understand that the enemy wants to create some kind of grey zone where military equipment can't enter and where people can't move in large groups,\" Pavlo Kuzmenko suggests.\n\nWe met in the town library because his own offices had been destroyed by a Russian missile strike.\n\n\"Along the whole of our border, the enemy is gradually creating an area where Ukrainians will not be able to tread,\" the mayor believes.\n\nThere is another reason for the increased bombardment.\n\nJust ahead of Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin, a group of Russian fighters announced an armed incursion from Ukraine - into their own country.\n\nThe self-styled \"liberation forces\" wanted to show that Mr Putin had lost control of his border. That's when villagers say the military air strikes on Velyka Pysarivka began.\n\nTetiana described life in the village then as \"hell\".\n\nThe Russian forces are made up of men ranging from openly far-right nationalists to Siberian separatists. They're linked by a belief that only armed resistance can change Russia now and remove Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe size and military effectiveness of the forces, based in Ukraine and backed by Ukrainian military intelligence, is unclear.\n\nIn Kyiv on Thursday, a spokesman for one of the groups said their ongoing raids had tied up the \"Kremlin military machine\", scuppering plans for a new push into Ukraine.\n\nMy own sources suggest there could be as much hype as actual fighting.\n\nWhen I questioned whether their self-vaunted achievements merited the destruction of Ukrainian villages, another spokesman said that civilians suffering was \"sad\".\n\nBut he said fighting an enemy like Russia \"without victims and ruin\" was impossible.\n\nIt's not only the fighting that families are fleeing in Sumy.\n\nThe northern region has the only working border crossing in the country from Russia, making it the main route for Ukrainians escaping occupation.\n\nEvery day, dozens of people from areas Russia has illegally claimed as its own endure a draining journey to reach territory controlled by Kyiv.\n\nThe Kremlin says the occupied regions turned out to vote for Putin this month in large, enthusiastic crowds.\n\nChildren in a Ukrainian welcome centre for displaced people\n\nBut that's not the picture painted by those who reach Sumy.\n\nThis week, Zoya Vypyraylo and her husband Mykhailo travelled three days from a village in the southern Kherson region that's now full of Russian soldiers.\n\n\"There are so many of them.

It was really scary,\" Zoya confided, when she finally reached a reception centre.\n\nShe says life under occupation changed her, radically: \"I had no will. No energy. My spirit was crushed.\"\n\nSo she and Mykhailo gave up everything. They handed their home of 53 years to a neighbour and left their ducks, chickens and dogs.\n\nZoya and her husband Mykhailo (centre) have left everything behind in Russian-occupied territory\n\n\"We want Kherson to be Ukraine.

Red Bull have dominated the start of the season, winning all five races so far.\n\nRed Bull has decided to build its own engine for 2026, and has formed a partnership with US giant Ford to invest in and badge the power-unit.\n\nAston Martin, who finished seventh in the championship last year, have made a huge step forward in competitiveness in 2023 and lie second in the constructors' championship behind Red Bull before this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nTheir driver Fernando Alonso is third in the drivers' championship, behind Verstappen and his team-mate Sergio Perez.\n\nAston Martin's progress has come after a major investment and restructuring programme in the past five years that includes the building of a new factory, which is scheduled to open before the end of this month. A new wind tunnel is also under construction and set for completion late in 2024.\n\nWatanabe said that Honda and Aston Martin's F1 team \"share the same spirit\".\n\nMartin Whitmarsh, the group chief executive officer of Aston Martin Performance Technologies, said: \"Aston Martin is building a team to win in F1. We have been recruiting the right people and investing in the required facilities and developing the right culture and processes to win.\n\n\"To partner a global motorsport titan like Honda is an extremely exciting and important further step for the team. Both organisations share the same relentless ambition to succeed on track. We are very proud, honoured and grateful to put in place this partnership.\"\n\nWhitmarsh, who was instrumental in bringing about Honda's return to F1 in 2015 when he was chief executive and team principal of McLaren, added that \"2026 will require full integration of chassis and power-unit that only a full works team delivers\".\n\nHe added: \"It's very clear from what we've seen from Honda and our recent learnings, they have a huge passion, they want to win, that is what they want to do, and that is our goal. We are already confident this is going be a fantastic partnership for the future.\"\n\nThe partnership will mean the end of Aston Martin's arrangement with Mercedes, from whom the team buy a large part of the rear of their car, including engine, gearbox and suspension.\n\nWhitmarsh admitted that taking on the manufacture of the gearbox and suspension was \"a big challenge but an essential one for us in stepping up\".\n\nWatanabe said that Honda had no plans to supply any other teams \"for the moment\".\n\nAlonso joined McLaren in 2015 to be part of the Honda project but the team and engine company split after three uncompetitive years. In that time, Alonso's relationship with Honda frayed, partly because of some public criticisms of the engine by the two-time champion.\n\nBut Watanabe said that driver choices would be \"fully up to the team\" and Honda had \"no objection\" to working with Alonso again.\n\nAlonso is in the first season of a two-year deal with Aston Martin. He turns 42 in July and would be 44 by the start of Honda's partnership with the team.\n\nWhitmarsh said: \"Honda are a very great partner for us. Fernando sees that. Probably 2026 is outside his planning horizon at the moment. We have to give him a car that can consistently win races.\n\n\"We have made a reasonable step forward. We are not yet where we need to be but we will get stronger. We will have a discussion before 2026, I'm sure, about where Fernando's future lies.\n\n\"I hope he'll be around for a number of years and it'd be great if he's as fit and competitive as he is today. Then it would be fantastic to have him in the car in 2026 as well.\"\n\u2022 None Will Wrexham get to the Premier League?

Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nStockton Rush was the chief executive of OceanGate, the firm which runs the Titanic voyages, and the company confirmed he was on board.\n\nHe was an experienced engineer who had previously designed an experimental aircraft and worked on other small submersible vessels.\n\nMr Rush founded the company in 2009, offering customers a chance to experience deep sea travel, and made global headlines in 2021 when it began offering trips to the site of the Titanic wreck.\n\nFor $250,000 (\u00a3195,600), his company offers passengers the opportunity to get an up-close glimpse of what remains of the famous ship.\n\nParticipants travel some 370 miles (595km) on a larger ship to the area above the wreck site, then do an eight-hour dive to the Titanic on a truck-sized submersible known as Titan.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in 2022, he defended the business model, and said the ticket price was a \"fraction of the cost of going to space and it's very expensive for us to get these ships and go out there\".\n\nA 2017 feature written for the website of Princeton University, where he studied, reported that Mr Rush goes on every OceanGate dive.\n\nMr Rush was married to Wendy Rush, who is the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, who died in the Titanic wreck after letting women and children escape before them.\n\nMike Reiss, a writer and producer of The Simpsons, went on a Titanic dive in a different OceanGate submersible with Mr Rush. He said the CEO was a \"magnetic man\", the New York Times reported, adding that he was \"the last of the American dreamers\".\n\nHamish Harding has flown to space and visited the South Pole\n\nThe British adventurer ran Action Aviation, a Dubai-based private jet dealership, and completed several exploration feats.\n\nHe visited the South Pole multiple times - once with former astronaut Buzz Aldrin - and flew into space in 2022 on board Blue Origin's fifth human-crewed flight.\n\nHe held three Guinness World Records, including longest time spent at full ocean depth during a dive to the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.\n\nIn summer 2022, he told Business Aviation Magazine that he grew up in Hong Kong, qualified as a pilot in the mid-1980s while studying at Cambridge, and set up his aircraft firm after making money in banking software.\n\nHe said the Titanic dive had been meant to take place in June 2022 but was delayed because \"the submersible was unfortunately damaged on its previous dive\". He said no-one was injured in the incident.\n\nAsked about his appetite for exploration, he said: \"My view is that these are all calculated risks and are well understood before we start.\"\n\nLast weekend, he said on Facebook that the mission was \"likely to be the first and only in 2023\" because of poor weather conditions in Newfoundland, Canada, where the missions set off from.\n\nLater, his stepson Brian Szasz said in a now-deleted post on Facebook that his stepfather \"has gone missing on (the) submarine\".\n\nFriend David Mearns, a marine scientist and expedition leader, described Mr Harding as a \"very charming guy\" who was attracted to extreme adventures.\n\nPatrick Woodhead, founder of British tour operator White Desert Antarctica, said Mr Harding was an \"incredible\" aviation explorer, and that his thoughts and prayers were with Mr Harding's wife, Linda, and his sons.\n\nTerry Virts, a retired Nasa astronaut, said his friend was the \"quintessential British explorer\" who loved adventure and exploring, but was not an adrenaline junkie.\n\n\"Some people watch Netflix, some people play golf, and Hamish goes to the bottom of the ocean, or into space, and he's set world records flying around the planet,\" he told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.\n\nLucy Cosnett, Mr Harding's cousin and goddaughter, called for a full investigation into his death as she described him as a \"lovely caring person\".\n\n\"When I read they had heard banging noises I was feeling hopeful that maybe it was coming from the submersible. But then yesterday was the worst when I heard that he didn't make it, that they all died,\" she said.\n\n\"There should have been more safety checks done. The company OceanGate should have done more\u2026 it should be fully investigated, to see what went wrong, why it happened, why they didn't survive.\"\n\nMs Cosnett added she was also feeling sad that she would not be able to wish her godfather a happy birthday as he would have turned 59 years old this weekend.\n\nMr Harding - along with Paul-Henry Nargeolet who was also on board - was a member of the Explorers Club, a little known century-old exploration group whose members have included Sir Edmund Hillary and Amelia Earhart.\n\nIts president, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, said Mr Harding's excitement over the expedition had been palpable during a meeting at last week's Global Exploration Summit.\n\nBritish businessman Shahzada Dawood was from one of Pakistan's richest families. He was travelling on the sub with his son Suleman, a student.\n\nMr Dawood lived with his wife, Christine, and other child, Alina, in Surbiton, south-west London. The family were spending a month in Canada prior to the dive.\n\nShahzada was vice-chairman of Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corporation, which is a large fertiliser firm.\n\nHe worked with his family's Dawood Foundation, as well as the SETI Institute, a California-based research organisation which searches for extra-terrestrial life.\n\nShahzada was also a supporter of two charities founded by King Charles III - the British Asian Trust and the Prince's Trust International.\n\nA Palace spokesperson previously said the King's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with all those onboard.\n\nWill Straw, the chief executive officer of Prince's Trust International, said he was \"deeply saddened by this terrible news\".\n\nThe British Asian Trust said it was an \"unfathomable tragedy\".\n\n\"We try to find solace in the enduring legacy of humility and humanity that they have left behind and find comfort in the belief that they passed on to the next leg of their spiritual journey hand-in-hand, father and son,\" a spokesperson for the trust added.\n\nShahzada's family said he was interested in \"exploring different natural habitats\", and had previously spoken at both the United Nations and Oxford Union.\n\nHe studied in Philadelphia, in the US, and the University of Buckingham in England, where he graduated in 1998.\n\nSuleman was a student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where he had just completed his first year at the university's Business School.\n\nFollowing news of his and his father's death, Suleman's aunt told NBC News the 19-year-old had said he felt \"terrified\" about the trip, but wanted to please his dad.\n\nA family statement described the teenager as a \"big fan of science fiction literature and learning new things\", and having an interest in Rubik's cubes and playing volleyball.\n\nHe recently graduated from ACS International School Cobham in Surrey, according to local media reports.\n\nThe university's principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, wrote to students to inform them that Suleman was in the missing sub.\n\nHe said the student wellbeing team was available to support those affected by the news.\n\nThe plight of Suleman and his fellow passengers had been raised at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf said: \"My thoughts are very much with the families and the communities that are affected.\"\n\nPaul-Henry Nargeolet was a diver in the French Navy\n\nAlso on board was Mr Nargeolet, a former French Navy diver.\n\nNicknamed Mr Titanic, he reportedly spent more time at the wreck than any other explorer and was part of the first expedition to visit it in 1987, just two years after it was found.\n\nHe was director of underwater research at a company that owns the rights to the Titanic wreck.\n\nAccording to a company profile, Mr Nargeolet supervised the recovery of thousands of Titanic artefacts, including the \"big piece\", a 20-tonne section of the boat's hull.\n\nFamily spokesman Mathieu Johann described Mr Nargeolet as a \"super-hero for us in France\".\n\n\"He is the world specialist on the Titanic, its conception, the shipwreck, he has dived in four corners of the world,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\u00c9ric Derrien, director at Genavir, a subsidiary of the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, where Mr Nargeolet had worked for more than 10 years, said staff \"shared the grief of his family and friends\".\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the death of this insatiable explorer of the ocean, who left his mark on Genavir. His dives will remain engraved in the memory of French oceanography,\" he said.\n\n\"We would also like to extend our sincerest condolences to the families of the Titan's other passengers.\"\n\nShortly before boarding the sub, Mr Nargeolet said he had been looking forward to an expedition next year to recover objects from the wreck, he added.\n\nMr Nargeolet's wife, Anne, who is French, lives in Connecticut, while his children live outside of France, according to Reuters.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nDo you know anyone involved with the Titanic submersible?

Headlines had branded them \"party animals\".\n\n\"So Rylan and I always sort of were under the impression that we were removed, because that supported the narrative,\" Spraggan says.\n\nThe pair were not given additional security at the new hotel, she adds.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this story, please visit BBC Action Line.\n\nThe night they were moved, Spraggan attended Rylan's birthday party at a club in Mayfair.\n\nSpraggan says she can't remember what happened that night and has pieced together the incident through information from the police and others.\n\nShe knows she was not conscious - because she had been drinking alcohol at the party - when she was escorted back to the hotel by a member of the production team.\n\n\"The hotel porter that had offered his help to get me up to bed\u2026 got a key card, let himself into my room and raped me,\" she explains.\n\nIn 2013, the porter pleaded guilty to the attack and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nRylan was the first person Spraggan told about what happened. \"He was unbelievable,\" she says, describing him as \"an angel\".\n\nSpraggan says being examined by police for evidence was \"one of the worst experiences\" of her life.

Spraggan says she feels she had to go along with the narrative at the time, but says she is now relieved she can tell the truth.\n\nSpraggan felt like she didn't get enough support in the aftermath of the attack - and in the following years her mental health deteriorated considerably and she abused alcohol and drugs. She has now been sober for nearly four years.\n\nFremantle said: \"Whilst we believed throughout that we were doing our best to support Lucy, as Lucy thinks we could have done more, we must therefore recognise this.

Spraggan says she was ready to give him \"a piece of my mind\" when he called her, after she had contacted his people to say she was writing her book.\n\nShe says he said, \"Lucy, before you or I say anything else, the first thing I need to tell you is that I am sorry.\"\n\nSpraggan reflects: \"It makes me emotional because no-one else said sorry. And all it took was this one man to treat me like a human being, 11 years later.\"\n\nIn 2021, Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, announced changes to its Broadcasting Code to better protect people made vulnerable by their participation in TV shows.

I've been petrified of telling the truth, because I'll lose what I have,\" Spraggan says.\n\n\"If I have to be the first person who says 'I'm actually not scared to stand up against you [the industry]', I will. And hopefully it inspires other people to be a little bit braver too.\"\n\nIn a statement, ITV said it had \"the deepest compassion for Lucy\". It said the production companies, Fremantle and Syco, were primarily responsible for the duty of care towards all of its programme contributors.\n\nBut it added it \"is committed to having in place\u2026 robust oversight procedures, to [ensure] that independent producers employ the correct processes to protect the mental health and welfare of participants\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It's excruciating... It's relentless.\"\n\nLike Naga, Jen's symptoms began as a teenager when she started her periods.\n\n\"I vividly remember being 11 and on my parents' bedroom floor unable to stand up straight, passing out every month from pain and blood loss.\"\n\nWhen the family sought medical help, Jen was put on the contraceptive pill to \"regulate\" her hormones and sent home with no other investigations or a diagnosis.\n\nJen remained on it until she turned 30, still experiencing monthly bleeds that were \"crazy heavy\" and \"like a horror scene\".\n\n\"Whenever I would go to the doctor to explain it's happening, again, I was just told 'it's normal'. At one point I was told to 'stop making a fuss'.\n\n\"So eventually you just start questioning yourself, don't you? Almost gaslighting yourself.\"\n\nJen persevered with seeking help though and was recently referred to a specialist doctor who diagnosed her condition - adenomyosis, plus another problem called endometriosis.\n\nJen says: \"I'm angry, I'm infuriated, I am devastated. I'm all of these things.\"\n\nShe got tired of people saying \"but you don't look sick\" and turned to her make-up artist friend, Kate, to help show what the condition feels like, by painting bruises and cuts on her abdomen and thighs. She has posted photos on Instagram to raise awareness.\n\nGP Nighat Arif, who specialises in women's health and has written a book about menstruation and menopause, says awareness about the condition among healthcare professionals is improving.\n\nBut she says it can be difficult to \"join the dots\" and make a speedy diagnosis because the symptoms can be mistaken for other things and can vary between women.\n\n\"Even on an ultrasound scan the diagnosis of adenomyosis can be missed or not seen. Many younger women also can get placed on hormonal contraceptive treatments to manage heavy periods and therefore 'mask' the diagnosis,\" she says.\n\nConsultant gynaecologist Liza Ball advised: \"Period issues often get 'normalised', which is frustrating. Ask to see a GP with gynaecology training to discuss treatment options that suit you.\n\n\"Don't suffer in silence and seek help if you think you have adenomyosis.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says it is committed to improving the health of women - it recently launched a 10-year Women's Health Strategy for England - and will be updating health information provided on the NHS website to provide more detail on conditions such as adenomyosis.\n\nJulia Allen from Cardiff was eventually diagnosed with adenomyosis and endometriosis in her mid-forties after decades of suffering.\n\nShe says she was \"back and forth to the doctor\" from the age of 14 due to very heavy and painful periods.\n\n\"I would have to take spare clothes to school and eventually work due to the flooding I experienced. This was mortifying, especially in a time when people didn't talk about these kinds of things,\" she says.\n\n\"Over the years I was told it was irritable bowel syndrome or constipation. I eventually had a scan, where speckling in my uterus showed up. The GP turned to me and said 'I don't know how to treat you' and that was that.\"\n\nJulia says she was never able to conceive, despite repeated rounds of IVF treatment, which she believes may have made her adenomyosis worse.\n\n\"When I eventually had my hysterectomy my consultant came to my room and said 'if I had seen you 20 years earlier, you could've had a baby'.

Since this article was originally published on the 4th July, Mr Farage submitted a subject access request to Coutts bank and obtained a report from the bank's reputational risk committee. While it mentioned commercial considerations, the document also said the committee did not think continuing to have Mr Farage as a client was \"compatible with Coutts given his publicly-stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation\". We have amended this article's headline and copy to make clear that the details about the closure of Nigel Farage's bank account came from a source.\n\nNigel Farage fell below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, the prestigious private bank for the wealthy, the BBC has been told.\n\nIt is understood he was subsequently offered a standard account at NatWest which owns Coutts.\n\nMr Farage has said he believes his account is being shut for political reasons and he has since been turned down by nine other lenders.\n\nBut a source familiar with Coutts' move said it was a \"commercial\" decision.\n\n\"The criteria for holding a Coutts account are clear from the bank's website,\" they told the BBC.\n\nCoutts requires its customers to borrow or invest at least \u00a31m with the bank or hold \u00a33m in savings.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC from France, Mr Farage did not dispute the fact that he did not meet Coutts' threshold, but added: \"They didn't have a problem with it for the last 10 years.\"\n\nThe former leader of the UK Independence Party and Brexiteer later tweeted that at \"no point\"\" had Coutts given him a minimum threshold.\n\nHe added that his business account was being closed despite the fact that last year he had \"large significant positive cash balances\" going through it.\n\nCoutts said it did not comment on individuals' accounts.\n\nMr Farage recently posted a six-minute video on Twitter blaming \"serious political persecution\" from an anti-Brexit banking industry.\n\nHe said that losing his bank account was the equivalent of being a \"non-person\" and that the decision may \"fundamentally affect my future career and whether I can even go on staying living here in this country\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's the World at One on Tuesday, Mr Farage said that Coutts had given him \"no reason whatsoever\" when they wrote to say that his accounts would be closed, and he was given two months to find a new bank.\n\nMr Farage also disputed the fact that he was offered a NatWest account at the time his Coutts accounts were withdrawn. He says the offer of a NatWest account came late last week.\n\nThe former politician said the bank only did this when he \"went public\" with his story, and that it only offered him a personal account, not a business account.\n\n\"Well what use to me is that?\" he told the BBC. \"I operate through a business, that's how I live. Any income that comes to me personally comes through my business.\"\n\nThe BBC understands that the offer of a NatWest account still stands.\n\nMr Farage claims other banks have refused to take him on as a customer on the grounds that he is a \"politically exposed person\" (PEP).\n\nA PEP generally presents a higher risk for financial institutions as regulators consider such people to be more exposed to the risk of potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence they may hold.\n\nMr Farage told the BBC: \"Are you telling me that all the other banks say it was a PEP thing and Coutts wasn't? Draw your own conclusions.\"\n\nSpeaking on GB News later on Tuesday, he questioned why Coutts's had been \"discussing my financial situation publicly,\" adding it was not \"ethical\".\n\nA Treasury spokesman said it would be a \"serious concern\" if financial services were being denied to those exercising their right to lawful free speech.\n\n\"We are already looking into this issue and have passed a law that requires the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to review how banks treat politically exposed persons - so we can strike the right balance between the customer's right to free speech and the bank's right to manage commercial risk.\"\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But special forces are by their very nature highly effective. Their presence in Ukraine is likely to be seized upon by Moscow, which has in recent months argued that it is not just confronting Ukraine, but Nato as well.\n\nIn line with its standard policy on such matters, the UK's Ministry of Defence has not commented, but in a tweet on Tuesday said the leak of alleged classified information had demonstrated what it called a \"serious level of inaccuracy\".\n\n\"Readers should be cautious about taking at face value allegations that have the potential to spread misinformation,\" it said.\n\nIt did not elaborate or suggest which specific documents it was referring to. However, Pentagon officials are quoted as saying the documents are real.\n\nOne document, which detailed the number of casualties suffered in Ukraine on both sides, did appear to have been doctored.\n\nUK special forces are made up of several elite military units with distinct areas of expertise, and are regarded to be among the most capable in the world.\n\nThe British government has a policy of not commenting on its special forces, in contrast to other countries including the US.\n\nThe UK has been vociferous in its support of Ukraine, and is the second largest donor after the US of military aid to Kyiv.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation and he was determined to find the source of the leak.\n\n\"We will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Watch: What Mary Quant's miniskirts looked like in the 1960s\n\nModel Twiggy Lawson has led the tributes to designer Dame Mary Quant, who has died aged 93.\n\nThe fashion legend passed away \"peacefully at home in Surrey\", her family announced on Thursday.\n\nDame Mary was credited with popularising the miniskirts that helped define the Swinging '60s.\n\nTwiggy, who became a style icon during the era, said Dame Mary had \"such an influence on young girls in the late 50s early 60s\".\n\n\"She revolutionised fashion and was a brilliant female entrepreneur,\" she wrote in a social media post. \"The 1960s would have never been the same without her.\"\n\nFormer Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman called Dame Mary a \"leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship\", adding she was \"a visionary who was much more than a great haircut.\"\n\nVanessa Friedman, the fashion director of the International New York Times, tweeted: \"RIP Mary Quant, who freed the female leg. We owe you.\"\n\nHer family described her as \"one of the most internationally recognised fashion designers of the 20th Century and an outstanding innovator\".\n\n\"She opened her first shop Bazaar in the King's Road in 1955 and her far-sighted and creative talents quickly established a unique contribution to British fashion.\"\n\nFormer Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman described Dame Mary (pictured in 2009) as \"a visionary\"\n\nDame Mary has been lauded for decades as an innovator whose chic designs melded comfort and practicality.\n\nShe drew inspiration from the counterculture scene that sprung up in west London in the 1950s, the area which became her base.\n\nTaking cues from Mod style - which incorporated Italian sports clothing - she designed outfits that made women feel comfortable, rather than just items for big occasions.\n\nIt appealed widely to a generation of young women eager for an alternative to the otherwise subdued fashions commonplace in post-war Britain.\n\nDame Mary (pictured in 1966) was a major figure in the fashion industry in the 1960s\n\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum said: \"It's impossible to overstate Quant's contribution to fashion. She represented the joyful freedom of 1960s fashion, and provided a new role model for young women.\n\n\"Fashion today owes so much to her trailblazing vision.\"\n\nPhotographer David Bailey, who captured much of the spirit of London in the 1960s, told the BBC that Quant \"was kind of wonderful, she was very positive\".\n\nDame Mary was one of the most influential figures in the fashion scene of the 1960s and is credited with making fashion accessible to the masses with her sleek, streamlined and vibrant designs.\n\nBorn in south-east London on 11 February 1930, Dame Mary was the daughter of two Welsh schoolteachers.\n\nShe gained a diploma in the 1950s in art education at Goldsmiths College, where she met her husband Alexander Plunket Greene, who later helped establish her brand.\n\nA budding designer, Dame Mary was taken on as an apprentice to a milliner before making her own clothes, and in 1955 opened Bazaar, a boutique on the King's Road in Chelsea.\n\nThe shop would become the beating heart of Swinging London. Bazaar sold clothes and accessories and its basement restaurant became a meeting point for young people and artists.\n\nThe whole Chelsea district was soon attracting celebrities such as Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\nAn recent exhibition of Dame Mary's work saw models wear her designs to launch the show at the V&A\n\nHer far-sighted and creative talents quickly established a unique contribution to British fashion.\n\nDame Mary was arguably best known for conceiving the miniskirt and hot pants as well as helping to develop the mod style in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2014, Dame Mary, who named the skirt after her favourite make of car, recalled its \"feeling of freedom and liberation\".\n\nShe said: \"It was the girls on King's Road who invented the mini. I was making clothes which would let you run and dance and we would make them the length the customer wanted.\n\n\"I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'shorter, shorter'.\"\n\nDame Mary told the Guardian in 1967 that \"good taste is death, vulgarity is life\", and raised the hemline well above the knee as she created short dresses and skirts with simple shapes and strong colours that she described as \"arrogant, aggressive and sexy\".\n\nWhether or not Dame Mary actually invented the miniskirt has been the subject of a long and bitter dispute with late French designer Andre Courreges, among others.\n\nBut her role in turning the thigh-skimming super-short hemlines into an international trend has not been disputed.\n\nDame Mary explored geometric designs, polka dots and contrasting colours, and played with new fabrics, including PVC and stretch fabrics, to achieve a modern and playful look.\n\nHer models were showcased in extravagant and provocative window displays overlooking the King's Road, which became a miniskirt catwalk and drew American photographers keen to picture Swinging London.\n\nWriting in her 1966 book Quant by Quant, Dame Mary recalled: \"City gents in bowler hats beat on our shop window with their umbrellas shouting 'immoral!' and 'disgusting!' at the sight of our miniskirts over the tights, but customers poured in to buy,\" she recalled.\n\nAs well as popularising the bob haircut pioneered by her friend Vidal Sassoon, the hairstylist and businessman, Dame Mary also created hot pants, the skinny rib sweater and waterproof mascara.\n\nDame Mary also created hot pants, the skinny rib sweater and waterproof mascara\n\nDame Mary pictured in 1972 with Vidal Sassoon (centre) and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson\n\nDame Mary, who was also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the society's highest award, was made an OBE in 1966 and a dame in 2015 for services to the fashion industry. She was made a companion of honour in the most recent New Year Honours.\n\nA retrospective exhibition of her work opened at the V&A in 2019 and has since toured Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nReflecting on the first 20 years of her career as the show launched, Dame Mary said: \"It was wonderfully exciting and despite the frenetic, hard work we had enormous fun.\n\n\"We didn't necessarily realise that what we were creating was pioneering, we were simply too busy relishing all the opportunities and embracing the results before rushing on to the next challenge.\"\n\nActress and designer Sadie Frost said she was \"honoured\" to front a documentary about Dame Mary's \"astonishing life\" in 2021.\n\n\"The more I researched and delved into her life I realised the vast impact she had on fashion, popular culture, history and women's rights,\" Frost said in a statement to the BBC. \"I really felt like I knew and loved her.

Sabrina Lee explains why Wales has had snow\n\nA warning for heavy snow was issued for Conwy", "Hunter Biden is expected to avoid jail time under a plea agreement\n\nUS President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, is expected to plead guilty to two misdemeanour tax crimes and admit to illegally possessing a gun while a drug user, after a five-year investigation.\n\nThe US Attorney in Delaware has filed papers indicating a plea agreement has been reached.\n\nThe terms of the agreement are likely to keep him out of jail.\n\nTop Republicans have called it evidence of a \"two-tiered system of justice\".\n\nIn theory, the president's son still faces a maximum penalty of a year in prison on each of the tax charges and 10 years in prison on the gun charge, the justice department said in a statement.\n\nHe is expected to agree to drug treatment and monitoring as part of the proposed deal.\n\nThe final deal would need to be approved by the judge in the case, who will also determine his sentence.\n\nIt is unclear when Hunter Biden will appear in court to enter his guilty plea on the tax charges.\n\nHe will admit to felony gun possession as part of a \"pre-trial diversion agreement\" that is separate from the plea deal, his lawyer Chris Clark said in a statement.\n\n\"I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life,\" Mr Clark added. \"He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\"\n\nMr Clark told MSNBC that the conditions of his client's probation were \"up to to the court\" but that he expected Mr Biden would be released without conditions after his court appearance.\n\n\"I think the judge is going to do what's fair and I think what's fair is my client gets on with his life,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden, 53, has previously worked as a lawyer, and a lobbyist including abroad in China and Ukraine. He was discharged from the US Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nThe plea deal brings to an end a long-running justice department investigation into whether he properly reported his income and made false statements on paperwork used to purchase a firearm in 2018.\n\nThe two misdemeanour tax charges stem from a failure to pay more than $100,000 (\u00a378,000) in taxes in both 2017 and 2018. A former justice department official told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that these amounts would lead to most clients being charged with misdemeanours, but \"in the jail time range\".\n\nIn a statement, Joe Biden said that neither he nor Jill Biden would comment further on Hunter Biden's case.\n\nThe gun charge stems from a 2018 possession of a firearm while a drug user.\n\nIn a 2021 book, the younger Mr Biden admitted to being a heavy user of crack cocaine at that time.\n\nBut he reportedly said \"no\" on a federal form asking if he was \"an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance\". Lying on these forms can lead to jail time.\n\nThe deal comes as some Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have accused Joe Biden of \"weaponising\" the justice department against political opponents.\n\nHunter Biden has long been a target of scrutiny from conservatives, who have alleged that his dealings overseas indicate a pattern of corruption.\n\nNews of the plea deal was met with swift and strong criticism from Donald Trump and his campaign, as well as senior congressional Republicans.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the pro-Trump Make America Great Again Inc, called the agreement a \"sweetheart deal\" that allows the justice department to \"turn a blind eye\" to corruption. Mr Trump, for his part, called the deal a \"mere traffic ticket\".\n\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Capitol Hill that the deal was evidence of a \"two-tier\" system of justice and vowed that the case would \"enhance\" a separate Republican investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nProminent Democrats have remained largely quiet on the case. David Brock, a former right-wing investigative reporter turned pro-Democrat operative, said in a statement that the case should now be considered closed since \"Hunter will not be charged with any of the unfounded and outlandish issues Republicans and right-wing media have used to smear him with for years\".\n\nIn a brief statement, the White House also said that Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden \"love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment\".\n\nWhile the younger Mr Biden has detailed a troubled life and \"massive drug addiction\", he long denied engaging in illegal activity.\n\nHe first admitted knowledge of an investigation into him in December 2020.\n\nIn a statement at the time, he said that he was \"confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, with the benefit of professional tax advisers\".\n\nMr Clark has said he believes the investigation is now \"resolved\", but the justice department in its statement said that the probe is \"ongoing\".\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The spectator allegedly wore the offensive shirt at Saturday's FA Cup final\n\nA man has been charged over a football shirt which appeared to refer to the 97 fans who died as a result of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.\n\nJames White, 33, from Warwickshire, was charged with displaying threatening or abusive writing likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nHe was bailed to appear at Willesden Magistrates' Court in London on Monday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said 22 other people were arrested at the Wembley FA Cup final on Saturday.\n\nThe force said they were detained during the match between Manchester City and Manchester United for offences including assault, affray, possession of drugs and drunk and disorderly behaviour.\n\nOfficers are also investigating after an item was thrown on to the pitch after the United goal in their 2-1 defeat by City.\n\nPolice said no-one had been arrested yet over the incident.\n\nA crush developed in the stands where Liverpool fans were watching an FA Cup semi-final\n\nDuring Saturday's match, a photo of the back of a man wearing the number 97 and the words \"not enough\" on a Manchester United top was widely shared on social media.\n\nOn Sunday, the English FA issued a statement saying it would \"not tolerate abuse relating to Hillsborough or any football tragedy\".\n\nIt has previously said it was concerned about \"the rise of abhorrent chants\" over the disaster.\n\nLiverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne, who was at Hillsborough in 1989, described any inappropriate reference to the disaster as \"sick\".\n\nThe Met urged people not to share information online which could prejudice the proceedings against Mr White.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Nothing ever came of the project, and the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition,\" Mr DeSantis' office said in a statement.\n\n\"Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures.\"\n\nThe internal Disney email noted that the decision to scrap the project comes after \"new leadership\" at the company, referring to the sudden departure in November of ex-CEO Bob Chapek.\n\nThe Lake Nona campus, which had not been built, would have been a new home for employees at the firm's secretive theme park research and development arm, known as Imagineers, who were asked to move from California to Florida.\n\nMr D'Amaro's email said relocation would no longer be required and it would discuss next steps with those he said had already done so.\n\nMany of the jobs that were supposed to relocate to Florida were higher paid, white collar and tech-focused positions.\n\nThe Orlando Business Journal reported the project was valued at about $867m and that the average annual wage for the positions was $120,000.\n\nBob Iger, the former chief executive who made a stunning return to replace his successor, Mr Chapek, has announced sweeping changes to boost the firm's business, which has come under pressure as the traditional movie and television industries decline.\n\nDisney launched a streaming offering, Disney+, in 2019, but it remains loss making.\n\nUnlike other media companies, Disney has been shielded by the popularity of its theme parks, which have kept the firm profitable.\n\nBut the value of its share price has halved since peaking in March 2021, as investors predict a tough road ahead.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Iger announced a plan to save $5.5bn, involving a sweeping reorganisation of the company's operations and roughly 7,000 job losses.\n\nAmong the cuts, announced separately on Thursday, was the closure of a 100-room Star Wars-themed immersive hotel experience at one of its Florida theme parks.\n\nThe relationship between Disney and Florida - where it employs more than 70,000 staff - began deteriorating last year after Mr DeSantis condemned the company for opposing a state law banning discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools.\n\nIn April, Florida also moved to take control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District - covering the 25,000-acre area known as Walt Disney World - a self-governing zone, with utilities and a fire department.\n\nState lawmakers voted to give Mr DeSantis the power to appoint members to the district's governing board, removing that authority from landowners, of which Disney was by far the biggest.\n\nThe move prompted a lawsuit from Disney, accusing state officials of conducting \"a relentless campaign to weaponise government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain state officials\".\n\nDisney's parks in Florida have long been one of its most-popular attractions, bringing in about 50 million visitors each year.\n\nIn a call with investors a week ago, Mr Iger questioned Florida's interest in having Disney grow in the state.\n\n\"Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people and pay more taxes, or not?\" Mr Iger asked.\n\nAubrey Jewett, a politics professor at the University of Central Florida, said he believed Mr DeSantis and his allies \"did not think about the longer-term ramifications of their actions\" when they moved to \"punish Disney for speaking out\".\n\n\"They weren't going to move the Disney World complex someplace else.

Lauren James is a bit more creative, offers more movement and interchanging of positions.\"\n\nWiegman introduced James and Daly later in the second half and England could have extended their lead with Kelly, Stanway and Daly all having attempts, but Haiti also grew in confidence and tested Earps.\n\nEngland's back four of Lucy Bronze, Bright, Alex Greenwood and Jess Carter have not played together often and it was clear they need time to become better connected.\n\n'There are positives to take from today'\n\nBut despite clear teething problems and a growing concern for England's lack of ruthlessness in front of goal, they have still lost just once under Wiegman in 33 games.\n\nIt is also worth remembering they underwhelmed in their opening match of Euro 2022 before responding with an 8-0 thrashing of Norway in their second group game and going on to win the tournament.\n\n\"England have got a clean sheet. Mary Earps made some fantastic saves and dealt with the transitions and they managed to come through it,\" former England midfielder Karen Carney told ITV.\n\n\"Tournament football is about building momentum, getting points on the board and moving forward. There are definitely some positives to take from today.\"\n\nWiegman's demeanour remained cool as she acknowledged a dry period in goalscoring but highlighted clearly which areas England need to improve before their second group game against Denmark, who began with a win over China.\n\n\"Ruthlessness... what does that mean?\" said Wiegman. \"Sometimes it means the connections with the cross, the timing of the cross, where the cross ends in the penalty box and little things like that.\n\n\"We were very close to scoring a goal but their defence was tough too.

Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne described it as intolerable.\n\nMayor Vincent Jeanbrun was not at home, but his wife suffered a broken leg and a child was also hurt.\n\nFrance has seen violent protests after police killed a teenager on Tuesday.\n\nThe suspects in the incident in L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, south of Paris, have not been identified.\n\nMr Jeanbrun said he had been in his office overseeing the situation when the attack on his home occurred at 01:30 (23:30 GMT on Saturday).\n\nThe attackers used a car to ram through the gates of their home before setting the vehicle on fire so that the blaze would spread to the house, the mayor said in a statement.\n\nThen when his wife, Melanie Nowak, tried to flee with the children, aged five and seven, they were attacked with firework rockets.\n\n\"A line has been crossed,\" he said.\n\n\"If my priority today is to take care of my family, my determination to protect and serve the Republic is greater than before,\" he added.\n\nAttackers used a burning car to try to set Mayor Jeanbrun's home ablaze\n\nThe mayor, from the centre-right Les Republicains, has received widespread support from across the French political spectrum.\n\nThe public prosecutor's office has started an investigation for attempted murder.\n\nThe attack on Mayor Jeanbrun's home came during the fifth night of violent protests across France over the death of Nahel M, 17, who was shot by police at point-blank range during a traffic stop.\n\nAround 45,000 police were deployed in France on Saturday to control the protests and the interior ministry said Saturday night had been quieter, with fewer arrests overall.\n\nHowever there were more than 700 arrests across the country and more than 800 fires were lit by rioters during the course of the night, officials said.\n\nMr Jeanbrun had urged the French government earlier to impose a state of emergency in response to the riots, which President Emmanuel Macron has so far declined to do.\n\nThe French leader is due to meet with top officials later to discuss the crisis.", "Footage shared on social media showed an explosion lighting up the night sky\n\nAn explosion in the north of annexed Crimea has destroyed Russian missiles being transported by rail, Ukraine's defence ministry has said.\n\nThe Russian-installed head of the city of Dzhankoi said the area had been attacked by drones.\n\nUkraine announced the explosions but, as is normal, did not explicitly say it was behind the attack.\n\nIf confirmed, it would be a rare foray by Ukraine's military into Crimea, which has been annexed since 2014.\n\nRussia has suffered attacks in Crimea before, but in most cases, responsibility has either been unacknowledged by Ukraine or blamed on some kind of partisan sabotage.\n\nThis strike, if confirmed, suggests that the capacity of the Ukrainian air force to deploy drones has increased.\n\nUntil now, Crimea has largely seemed out of the range of Ukrainian missiles. But this attack indicates that a drone at least can reach deeper behind Russian lines than previously thought.\n\nThe \"mysterious\" explosions destroyed Russian Kalibr-NK cruise missiles, intended for use by Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian defence intelligence said. Kailbr missiles have been widely used in attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure in recent months.\n\nOne unconfirmed report from a resident cited on Ukrainian TV spoke of \"booms\" that went on for 30 minutes, leaving part of Dzhankoi with no electricity. The blasts \"continue the process of Russia's demilitarisation and prepares the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea for de-occupation\", the defence ministry said.\n\nDzhankoi has been used by Russian forces as a rail hub between Crimea and other areas of occupied Ukraine. Russian TV reports said that Tuesday's strike had not caused any damage to rail infrastructure.\n\nRussia's investigative authority said a residential building and a shop were damaged, according to initial findings. All the targets were civilian, it claimed.\n\nIhor Ivin, the Russian-installed administrator, said a 33-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment for a shrapnel injury from a downed drone. He made no mention of any military targets being damaged.\n\nSeveral buildings caught fire and the power grid was damaged, Mr Ivin was quoted as saying by local media. Another Russian-appointed official said a drone had been hit over a technical school, between an instruction area and a student residence.\n\nRussia's top official in occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said air defences near Dzhankoi had been activated and the situation was under control. He urged residents not to pay attention to \"fakes disseminated by Ukrainian propaganda\".\n\nLast August, an ammunition depot was targeted near Dzhankoi. Weeks later, Russia blamed Ukraine for carrying out a drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in which a warship was damaged.\n\nThis latest attack suggests Kyiv is determined to continue harrying the supply chains of Russian forces, targeting in particular its stock of missiles, as well as the routes along which they may be transported into southern occupied Ukraine via Crimea.\n\nSpeaking on Ukrainian TV, military spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk reminded viewers that Dzhankoi was a hub station for the occupying force and that, from the start of the Russians' full-scale invasion, it had been made clear that defeating their logistics would play a big part in the future status of Crimea.\n\nKyiv has a political incentive to keep Crimea in the news, too: a reminder that its current objective is not just to force Russian forces out of those areas captured since February last year, but also from the Black Sea peninsula annexed illegally in 2014.\n\nIn a separate development, authorities in southern Russia accused Ukrainian forces of using a drone to target a pumping station on an oil pipeline north of the Ukrainian border.

His family took him to the GP and he has since had counselling to treat his gambling disorder.\n\nBut Matthew wanted to know what had happened: \"Once the cycle of gambling was broken I analysed a mountain of data obtained under a subject access request. I wrote a letter of complaint to William Hill.\"\n\nWilliam Hill said it took customer complaints seriously\n\nWilliam Hill said: \"We conducted a thorough investigation into our management of Matthew's account and identified no shortcomings in our safer gambling procedures in relation to Matthew's account requirements during the period in question.\n\n\"Ensuring high standards of safer gambling and preventing gambling-related harm is central to the way William Hill operates and we take any customer complaint in this area incredibly seriously, and are committed to driving continuous improvement in this area.\"\n\nThe bookmaker was fined \u00a36.2m in 2018 for failing to protect consumers.\n\nMany of the cases highlighted by the regulator were similar to Matthew's and occurred at about the same time.\n\nA UK government white paper is due to be published soon, with recommendations for strict affordability checks and a new ombudsman for consumer complaints expected.\n\nCurrently, people with social responsibility complaints can only write to the Gambling Commission, which cannot comment on what action it is taking, leaving many people in limbo.\n\nMatthew said: \"Without significant change there will be many more who fall foul of the pitfalls as I did.

The former White House military valet is accused of moving files to hide them from the FBI.\n\nThe 49-page indictment contains the first-ever federal charges against a former US president. It says the classified documents Mr Trump stored in his boxes contained information about:\n\nProsecutors say that when Mr Trump left office, he took about 300 classified files to Mar-a-Lago - his oceanfront home in Palm Beach, which is also an expansive private members' club.\n\nThe charge sheet notes that Mar-a-Lago hosted events for tens of thousands of members and guests, including in a ballroom where documents were found.\n\nProsecutors say Mr Trump tried to obstruct the FBI inquiry into the missing documents by suggesting that his lawyer \"hide or destroy\" them, or tell investigators he did not have them.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?\" Mr Trump said to one of his attorneys, according to the indictment.\n\nMr Trump's first court appearance in the case will be in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday - the eve of his 77th birthday.\n\nFiles were allegedly stored in a ballroom at Donald Trump's Florida property, Mar-a-Lago\n\nMar-a-Lago \"was not an authorised location\" for classified documents to be kept or discussed, the indictment says.\n\nSome files were allegedly stored on stage in the ballroom, where events and gatherings took place - and later in a bathroom and a shower, an office space, and in Mr Trump's bedroom.\n\nOn two occasions in 2021, the former president allegedly showed classified documents to people without security clearance, including a writer and two members of staff.\n\nAt his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, which was also an \"unauthorised location\", he is said to have displayed and described a \"plan of attack\" that he told others had been prepared for him by the Department of Defense.\n\n\"As president I could have declassified it.

defence information were critical and must be enforced.\n\n\"We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone,\" he said in a brief statement in Washington.\n\nThe indictment

merciless\" murder.\n\nThe five-year-old girl died after being found at her family home with more than 70 injuries including a fractured skull.\n\nAbdul Wahab, 35, pleaded guilty in court in January and was given an automatic life sentence.\n\nNadia's mother Aleksandra Wahab, who pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child, was sentenced to 11 years.\n\nThe 29-year-old had also pleaded guilty to allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.\n\nShe will serve half her sentence in prison and half on licence.\n\nNadia's family in Poland said their lives had been shattered by her death.\n\nAt Belfast Crown Court, Mr Justice O'Hara said what Abudl Wahab had done to Nadia was \"brutal, merciless and outrageous\" .\n\nHe added the 22-year minimum tariff reflected the \"sustained nature of brutality\" he had inflicted on her.\n\nAleksandra Wahab allowed her daughter to be murdered\n\nIn January, a court had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home in Fernagh Drive in Newtownabbey and details of the injuries inflicted on Nadia were given.\n\nAs well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.\n\nThe injuries were inflicted over many months.\n\nAt the time she died she also had surface injuries including bruising and abrasions and her teeth were decayed and rotten.\n\nAbdul Wahab had claimed she was clumsy and had fallen down the stairs on the night she died.\n\nThe court was told the young son of Aleksandra and Abdul Wahab was taken to medical appointments regularly for \"relatively minor matters\" in stark contrast to how Nadia was treated.\n\nNadia often attended school in what was described as \"traditional Muslim dress\" which covered up her injuries.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Det Insp Gina Quinn said the \"young and innocent\" Nadia was subjected to a \"campaign of violence\" by her stepfather Abdul Wahab, while her mother ignored the \"very obvious attacks\".\n\n\"This was the ultimate betrayal of trust by the two people who should have protected loved and cared for Nadia,\" she said.\n\nDet Insp Quinn also read a statement from Nadia's family in Poland who \"loved and treasured\" her.\n\n\"Nadia was just a child. A child who had her young and innocent life cruelly taken away,\" the statement says.\n\n\"We are still trying to come to terms with what happened to Nadia, and I am not sure that we ever will.\n\n\"To be honest our worlds have been shattered.\n\n\"Nadia will always remain in the heart of her loving grandmother and her closest family in Poland.\"\n\nAbdul and Aleksandra Wahab sat in the glass-fronted dock at Belfast Crown Court, with guards on either side.\n\nAnother member of the security staff sat in between them.\n\nThe pair looked down at the floor for most of the sentencing hearing.\n\nTowards the end of the 45-minute-long session, Abdul Wahab put his head in his hands and appeared to weep.\n\nThe court heard how the defendant had described Nadia as his \"fairy princess\" - but the judge said that was a \"pathetic\" attempt by Mr Wahab to \"disavow\" his plea of guilty.\n\nAs well as admitting murder, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December 2019.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing, Public Prosecution Service assistant director Ciaran McQuillan said it was a deeply distressing case.\n\n\"Every murder is abhorrent, but this was an especially sickening and brutal murder of a young child,\" he added.", "The Threads app looks similar to Twitter\n\nFacebook owner Meta is launching its new app to rival Twitter and says it will go live on Thursday.\n\nThe app, which is called Threads and is available for pre-order on the Apple App Store, will be linked to Instagram.\n\nScreengrabs show a dashboard that looks similar to Twitter.

And there was an extra one-off lump sum of at least \u00a31,655 to top up the past year's salary. But on Friday, the RCN announced its members had rejected the offer by 54% to 46%.\n\nThe walkout from 20:00 BST on 30 April to 20:00 on 2 May will involve NHS nurses in emergency departments, intensive care, cancer and other wards.\n\nNurses have already walked out twice this year on 6 and 7 February and on 18 and 19 January - but on those dates there were exemptions so that nursing cover was maintained in critical areas.\n\nThe announcement comes just as the NHS is getting back to normal after a four-day walkout by junior doctors - who are demanding a 35% pay rise - which ended at 07:00 on Saturday.\n\nSir Julian, chief executive of NHS Providers, said during the strike by junior doctors gaps had been filled by consultants and other staff, but he warned if nurses went ahead with their action this might be more difficult to deal with.\n\n\"But with nursing staff, obviously that represent a significant proportion of the workforce, taking action in those areas as well that will present an unprecedented level of action, that we haven't yet seen from nursing staff and therefore the challenges with that, the organisation and all the work that go into managing and mitigating that will be enormous,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of nurses and junior doctors striking on the same day, he added: \"They are central, pivotal to the delivery of care across all sectors, hospitals, community services, mental health services.\n\n\"So obviously the prospect of both groups being out at the same time would present enormous challenges to the service and that would be really really the most difficult challenge ever faced yet if we had to deal with that scenario.\"\n\nThe RCN's director for England, Patricia Marquis, when asked by BBC Newsnight about coordinated strike action, said it was having conversations with the British Medical Association but not specifically around coordinating strikes.\n\n\"That's obviously something that would have to be considered, least because we're all in the same space. We all work in the same places\", she said.\n\n\"And therefore there may be an issue where our strikes do at some point either coordinate or overlap in someway.\"\n\nNick Hulme, chief executive of Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals said recent strike action had been a \"massive distraction from the work we should be doing\" including reducing waiting times - and urged all parties to find a quick solution.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hulme said he would be concerned if the currently separate strike action by nurses and junior doctors was co-ordinated at any stage.\n\n\"It just fills me with a lot of anxiety and it's almost something I can't comprehend,\" he said.\n\n\"Being able to run services safely without those two clinal groups of staff I think would be very, very difficult indeed and would increase the risks to patients.\"\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt urged members of the GMB and Unite unions - which represent smaller numbers of NHS staff - to join Unison in accepting the government's offer because it would be \"best for patients and best for staff\".\n\nThe British Medical Association, which represents junior doctors, said it was \"not ruling in or out\" of co-ordinated action with other unions - such as nurses' unions.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, the co-chairman of the BMA junior doctors committee, said that if the government refused to negotiate \"we are prepared to strike again\", adding: \"We will consider all options available to us.\"\n\nClint Cooper who is a nurse at Scarborough Hospital said he believed in the principles of what his colleagues were doing, but he decided to vote against strike action in the RCN ballot.\n\n\"Last week I had two patients who were very poorly and I wonder if I hadn't been there and escalated it, would they still be alive if I had walked out and that's my conscience talking to me,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow RCN member Diane Cawood voted to reject the government's latest pay offer, describing the staffing situation as \"dire\" and inpatient care as \"dangerous\" at the moment.\n\nThe mental health nurse, whose NHS trust did not meet the threshold to strike, said she enjoyed her work but \"the day may come when I can't afford to stay in this job\".\n\nNurse Clint Cooper said it was not just about pay but\"about the future of the NHS\"\n\nA Unison member who has worked as a nurse for 30 years and voted to accept the government's pay offer said the pressure on staff was \"unsustainable\" but pay was not the fundamental issue.\n\nThe specialist nurse, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that instead retention and recruitment \"presents the greatest challenge to the profession\".\n\nPat Cullen, RCN general secretary and chief executive, said that until there was a significantly improved offer, RCN nurses would be forced to go back to the picket line.\n\nShe said the government \"needs to increase what has already been offered and we will be highly critical of any move to reduce it\".\n\nThe Unison union, which represents some nurses and ambulance crews, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the government's pay offer.\n\nSara Gorton from Unison said health workers would have wanted more \"but this was the best that could be achieved through negotiation\".\n\nMembers have \"opted for the certainty of getting the extra cash in their pockets soon\", she added.\n\nHundreds of thousands of NHS staff from other unions are still voting on the same pay deal over the next two weeks.\n\nIn Scotland, union members have accepted an offer worth an average 6.5% for 2023-24.

It said the gunmen had fired at an Israeli army post.\n\nPalestinian officials have not commented on the incident. There has been a marked surge in violence between Palestinians and Israel in recent months.\n\nOn Saturday, protest organisers said as many as 500,000 demonstrators took to the streets across Israel for the 10th consecutive week, in what the Haaretz newspaper called \"the largest demonstration in the country's history\".\n\nAbout 200,000 people turned up in Tel Aviv - many carrying Israel's national flag - to rally against planned reforms by Mr Netanyahu's hardline government.\n\nA BBC producer in the city described the protests as the busiest yet, with a non-stop flow of demonstrators packing the streets until late into the night.\n\nIn remarkable scenes, crowds applauded Tel Aviv police chief Amichai Eshed as he walked in uniform through the rally.\n\nOn Thursday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir had said he was transferring Mr Eshed to head a training division, amid reports the ultra-nationalist politician accused the commander of being too soft on protesters, whom he calls \"anarchists\".\n\nBut Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara later overruled Mr Ben-Gvir, saying the decision was being frozen, while national police chief Kobi Shabtai on Saturday said he had \"made a mistake\" in dismissing Eshed.\n\nThe clash over the commander's position is significant. It comes amid predictions of a possible constitutional crisis, involving Israel's civil service and security forces being unable to take orders from the government, if no compromise is reached on the planned reforms, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.\n\nSpeaking at the demonstrations in Tel Aviv, former Israel police chief Moshe Karadi described Mr Ben-Gvir's control of the force as an unprecedented danger.\n\nHe said the minister was \"a convicted felon, enacting a hostile takeover of the police and trying to turn it into a private militia to serve his political purposes\".\n\nMr Ben-Gvir has previous convictions for racist incitement and supporting terrorism over his backing of a Jewish extremist group. He has said police would have \"zero tolerance\" of demonstrators who block roads, with forces using water cannon and stun grenades against protesters last week.\n\nSpeaking in the southern city of Be'er Sheva, Mr Lapid warned that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis.\n\n\"A wave of terrorism is hitting us, our economy is crashing, money is escaping the country. Iran just signed yesterday a new agreement with Saudi Arabia. But the only thing this government cares about is crushing Israeli democracy,\" he said.\n\nIn the northern city of Haifa, a record crowd of 50,000 marched on Saturday.\n\nThe planned reforms have caused deep divides in Israeli society\n\nThe reforms aim to give the elected government decisive influence over the choice of judges, and limit the ability of the Supreme Court to rule against the executive or strike down legislation.\n\nThe issue has caused deep divides in Israeli society and, significantly, has seen reservists - the backbone of Israel's military - threatening to refuse to serve as a way of showing their opposition.\n\nLast Monday, in an unprecedented move, dozens of reserve fighter pilots in an elite Israeli Air Force squadron said they would not report for training. They later reversed course and agreed to attend and hold talks with their commanders.\n\nOn Thursday, protesters blocked roads and attempted to stop Mr Netanyahu flying out of the country. He later took off for Rome.\n\nThe government has stood firm in the face of the uproar, claiming the protests are being fuelled by political opponents.\n\nCritics say the planned reforms, which are already making their way through parliament, will politicise the judiciary and could lead to an authoritarian government.\n\nMr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the Israeli public at the last election.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: Protesters flood the streets of Tel Aviv this week", "COP28 President, is currently head of the country's state oil company Adnoc\n\nThe UK government has defended the United Arab Emirates' appointment of oil executive Sultan al-Jaber as head of this year's UN COP28 climate summit.\n\nIt comes after more than 130 lawmakers from the US and EU wrote to the UN calling for his removal.\n\nThe UN has long been criticised for the involvement of the fossil fuel industry in the COP climate summits.\n\nOn Thursday, Minister for Net Zero Graham Stuart said Jaber was \"an outstanding individual\".\n\nEvery year the host country for the global climate summit, known as COP, nominates a president. As well as organising the event they provide political leadership, heading up critical negotiations on climate action in the run up to, and during, the conference.\n\nThis year the hosts, the UAE, nominated Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, the head of the state oil company, as president of the summit, which starts in Dubai in November.\n\nCampaigners have been growing increasingly vocal against this decision, and this week 133 lawmakers from the EU and US joined the call for his removal.\n\nIn a joint letter addressed to the United Nations, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden, the lawmakers expressed their \"profound concern\" that the fossil fuel industry was allowed to exert influence on the talks.\n\nBut Mr Stuart, during a news conference on Thursday, defended the decision of the UAE.\n\nSpeaking at an environmental technology conference, he said: \"I think he is an outstanding individual and we look forward to working with the UAE to ensure COP28 is a success and gets more countries committing to the necessary emissions reductions.\"\n\nMr Stuart also defended Jaber's track record at ADNOC, the UAE state oil company, saying that he was cleaning up their operations and reducing emissions.\n\nAny emissions from the production of oil are dwarfed by the emissions produced when it is used. But the emissions from using oil products like petrol are the responsibility of the country where they are used\n\nThe UAE is one of the 10 largest oil producers in the world. Their state oil company pumped 2.7 million barrels of oil per day in 2021, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).\n\nThe company aims to expand to nearly double output to five million barrels per day by 2027 - a target date brought forward from 2030 two months ago by Jaber.\n\nZeina Khalil Hajj, head of global campaigning for 350.org, one of the groups calling for his removal, said: \"It is the equivalent of appointing the CEO of a cigarette company to oversee a conference on cancer cures.\"\n\nIn ten days countries will come together for the Bonn climate conference - the halfway point to COP28 which is used to reflect on progress in reaching climate targets. There are suggestions that these talks will be used to reflect on the involvement of polluting industries, like oil companies, in the talks.", "'Here's my number, so call me, Barclay'\n\nWe're now hearing speeches at the BMA rally in Trafalgar Square with plenty of interjections and responses from the noisy crowd.

But in peacetime Ukraine's huge grain exports give it substantial economic leverage, particularly in parts of the developing world.\n\n\"If anyone in the world thinks that the way this or that country behaved - or treated Ukraine at the darkest moment of its history - will not be taken into account in building future relations, these people just don't know how diplomacy works,\" he said.\n\n\"War is a time when you have to make a choice. And every choice has been recorded.\"\n\nUkraine is using vast amounts of shells and ammunition to defend itself - and needs even more\n\nMr Kuleba said Western allies were not giving Ukraine military support fast enough because they had not been ready for a conflict on the same scale as World War One. And what he needed was artillery shells.\n\n\"We want partners to act faster,\" he said. \"And if one delivery is postponed for one day, it means that someone is going to die on the front line.\n\n\"It means that someone who could have been still alive is going to die.\"\n\nNowhere has the demand for ammunition been greater than in the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian forces have been holding out for more than seven months against repeated Russian attempts to seize the city.\n\nThis, Mr Kuleba said, was \"emotionally very challenging\" because of the losses suffered.\n\nBut if Bakhmut fell, then other cities would be next: \"So in order to save lives there\u2026 we have to fight in Bakhmut as long as we physically can.\"\n\nRussia has lost many troops battling for Bakhmut, but Ukraine has also suffered high casualties defending it\n\nThere was no sign, he said, of Russia being willing to negotiate an end to the fighting but he added: \"Every war ends at the negotiating table... But my goal as a foreign minister is to make sure that Ukraine reaches the table after a defining success on the battlefield.\"\n\nAnd that involves building the strongest possible coalition of support, an alliance that he feels does not include the Pope. Mr Kuleba said it was not for him but for God to judge the Holy Father but, he said: \"We deeply regret that the Pope has not found an opportunity to visit Ukraine since the beginning of the war.\"\n\nChina, too, has thus far resisted Ukraine's lobbying for a meeting between China's President Xi Jinping and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, even though Beijing confirmed on Friday that China's leader is to visit Moscow next week.\n\nMr Kuleba said his president was ready for a telephone conversation with Mr Xi and added: \"I don't think China has reached the moment now\u2026 when it's ready to arm Russia.\"\n\nThe West worries China may start sending weaponry to Russia\n\nAs for the United States, some analysts have speculated support for Ukraine might reduce after next year's presidential elections. But Mr Kuleba said: \"I think we can survive any Republican voice\", and insisted \"the biggest luxury that Ukraine enjoys in the United States is the bipartisan support in both Democratic and Republican camps\".\n\nAs his country's top diplomat, Dmytro Kuleba remains quietly confident Ukraine can maintain the backing of the allies that count: the ones which provide tangible support.\n\nAnd, he says, Ukraine has one crucial factor on its side: \"Historically, Ukraine was unfairly under-appreciated, and I regret it took a bloodshed and a devastating war for the world to realise how cool we are.\n\n\"And we will always be cool.

Elections are due later this year.\n\nPakistan's army has heavily influenced the nuclear-armed country for most of its existence and is a crucial behind-the-scenes player.\n\nMany analysts believe Mr Khan's election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military. But since he was ousted from premiership, Mr Khan has become one of the military's most vocal critics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Khan was indicted on charges that he unlawfully sold state gifts during his premiership, in a case brought by Pakistan's Election Commission. Mr Khan denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA day earlier, dramatic footage showed dozens of security officers forcibly removing the 70-year-old from court - where he was attending to separate graft proceedings - then bundling him into a police vehicle.\n\nMr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party called his arrest in the capital Islamabad an \"abduction\" and said it would challenge its legality in court.\n\nThe judge has ordered that Mr Khan be remanded in custody for eight days, after which he can seek bail.\n\nThis is just one of over 100 corruption cases registered against Mr Khan since he left office. For months he had avoided arrest, with his supporters at times fighting pitched battles with police to keep him out of custody.\n\nOne of his Mr Khan's lawyers, Sher Afzal Marwat, said his client was in good spirits.\n\nAmid violent protests nationwide, Mr Khan's supporters ransacked the corps commander's residence in Lahore, smashing chandeliers and making away with peacocks, strawberries and golf clubs - among other things - which they said were bought with \"citizen's money\". Scores of vehicles and public installations were set alight.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nOn Wednesday, the BBC witnessed clashes between protesters and the police in the middle of one of Islamabad's main motorways.

A formal identification process will be carried out.\n\nMr Darmody was an experienced fisherman and a well-known member of the community in Cape York.\n\nThe two crocodiles, which measured 4.1m (13.4 ft) and 2.8m (9.2 ft) in length, were shot dead on Monday about 1.5 km (0.9 miles) from where he was last seen.\n\nHuman remains were found inside only one of the reptiles, but wildlife officers believe both were involved in the incident.\n\nThe fishermen with Mr Darmody at the time did not see the attack, but reported hearing him yell, followed by a loud splash.\n\n\"I raced down\u2026 but there was no sign of him, just his thongs [flip-flops] on the bank and nothing else,\" his friend John Peiti told the Cape York Weekly.\n\nCrocodiles are common in Australia's tropical north, but attacks are rare. Mr Darmody's death is just the 13th fatal attack in Queensland since record-keeping began in 1985.\n\nA fisherman was killed by a crocodile in similar circumstances on Queensland's Hinchinbrook Island in 2021, and there were also fatal attacks in the state's far north in 2017 and 2016.\n\nSince a ban on hunting in 1974, Queensland's crocodile population has rebounded from a low of some 5,000 animals to around 30,000 today.\n\nA 2019 report suggested an average of 1.7 adult crocs living in each kilometre of river surveyed.\n\nUnder Queensland's management programme, \"problem crocodiles\" are removed from areas where they threaten public safety and, in rare instances, euthanised.\n\nThose numbers are dwarfed by Australia's Northern Territory (NT), which is home to the world's largest wild crocodile population of some 100,000 reptiles.\n\nDespite publicity campaigns to be \"crocwise\" around rivers, there was an average of 1-2 deaths from crocodile attacks in the Territory each year from 2005, but none have occurred since 2018.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

On your heads be it.\"\n\nProtestors occupied the meadow in 2021 with one woman chaining herself to a gate\n\nBefore breaking into song, Ms Graves added: \"Here are the pasture meadows of Ty Clyd Farm in 1840, still here in 2023.\n\n\"Natural, unique, irreplaceable green pastures, providing health to our lungs, protection from cancer and refreshment for our souls.\"\n\nThe company selected to design and build the new cancer centre is Acorn.\n\nProject director Richard Coe responded, saying a plan had been put in place \"to make sure things like traffic, surface water and environmental concerns are well managed\".\n\n\"The Acorn team has engaged extensively with council officers, CADW and NRW and we have worked with that feedback to develop the final [construction environmental and management plan],\" he said.\n\n\"We are confident that it presents a very robust document to ensure that the project will be delivered with minimal impact and disruption to the local area for the shortest period possible.\"", "Staff overseeing May's local elections could be \"overwhelmed\" as they deal with the introduction of compulsory voter ID, councils have warned.\n\nFor the first time, everyone voting in person in English local elections on 4 May will need to show identification.\n\nThe Electoral Commission said there had been extensive planning to get councils ready for the challenge.\n\nCritics say the changes are unnecessary and will damage democracy by making it harder for some to vote.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the ID checks will ensure elections are \"high-integrity processes\", despite no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud in the UK.\n\nSince 2018, there have been nine convictions and six police cautions issued in connection with cases of electoral fraud, according to the Electoral Commission.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) - which represents local authorities - said the practical difficulties faced by councils enforcing ID checks \"should not be underestimated\".\n\nLGA spokesman Kevin Bentley said local authorities \"remain concerned about the potential for electoral staff to be overwhelmed with enquiries and voter authority certificate applications, now polling cards have been issued\".\n\nMr Bentley, the Conservative leader of Essex County Council, also said polling station staff might have to deal with abuse from voters who did not bring ID, telling the BBC \"that could possibly happen\".\n\nHe did not rule out calling on the UK government to scrap voter ID checks at the general election, due next year, if there are widespread problems on 4 May.\n\n\"If that were the case we would have that honest conversation\", he said.\n\nWith the local elections now less than three weeks away, new research from the Electoral Commission shows that almost a quarter of people it surveyed still did not know that photo ID was required to vote.\n\nCraig Westwood, from the Electoral Commission, said that voters often \"respond late\" ahead of elections and \"we always see a very significant spike in the days leading up to the deadline\".\n\nThe communications director said the Commission had been running a campaign since January to make sure people were aware of this change.\n\n\"The awareness in the public has gone up from 22% to 76% over that period and that's still with a month to go,\" he added.\n\nThe new rules mean that voters need to take photo ID to get their ballot papers in local elections in England, police and crime commissioner elections in England and Wales, and UK parliamentary elections.\n\nHowever, it is thought more than one million eligible voters do not currently have accepted forms of photo proof.\n\nPeople who do not have the right photo ID can apply for a free voter ID document - a \"voter authority certificate\" - from their local council.\n\nThe deadline to register for one of these is 25 April - but government data shows just 60,368 people have applied since the scheme was launched.\n\nMr Westwood said \"people understand\" the new photo ID rules, adding that applications for the voter authority certificate were increasing \"day by day\".\n\nHe also said there would be more staff at polling stations during the local elections in May.\n\nOfficials, who will be called \"greeters\", will be positioned outside some polling stations to \"make sure that people are definitely aware of the ID requirement\", he added.\n\nDeputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said voter ID was \"an expensive, unnecessary policy and the wrong priority at the height of a cost-of-living crisis\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have called on the government to \"cancel the voter ID measures before too many people lose their voice in this year's local elections\".\n\nGreen Party Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said young people and over-75s were most at risk of being disenfranchised and warned that denying their right to vote could \"swing results\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Photo ID is not required for postal votes.\n\nIn Northern Ireland - where photo ID is already required - 11 council elections are being held on 18 May. There are no local elections in Wales and Scotland in May.\n\nVoters in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to show ID at the next general election, widely expected in 2024.\n\nRishi Sunak said on Conservative Home on Thursday that about 98% of people already had acceptable forms of ID for voting.\n\nThat figure comes from a survey commissioned by the Cabinet Office in 2021.\n\nThe most commonly held form of ID was a passport, which 91% of people had.\n\nBut the Electoral Commission's research found a higher number, with 3% of people not having any photo ID and another 1% not having any photo ID where they think they are recognisable.\n\nONS figures from 2021 show almost 50 million people were registered to vote in local elections across the UK. That means that if 4% of people do not have acceptable ID, almost two million people will need to get hold of some if they want to vote.\n\nAlthough not all registered voters have elections in their areas this year, they will all need to get ID if they want to vote in the general election, which is expected to take place in 2024.", "Last updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nEuro 2022 top scorer Beth Mead is not included in England's Women's World Cup squad, having not fully recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\n\nThe Arsenal forward, 27, has not played since November and was a major doubt.\n\nTottenham striker Beth England, who has not been involved since last summer, is included having scored 12 goals in her past 12 Women's Super League games.\n\nChelsea centre-back Millie Bright, who has been out with a knee injury since March, has made the 23-player squad.\n\nEngland head coach Sarina Wiegman confirmed Bright would captain the team in the absence of injured defender Leah Williamson.\n\nMidfielder Fran Kirby was also already ruled out through injury, but Barcelona defender Lucy Bronze is in despite having knee surgery in April.\n\nWiegman said she did not ever think there was a chance Mead would be fit in time for the tournament in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\"She's so positive and going well, but the timescale she had we would have taken so many risks to get to the World Cup,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"I'm not willing to take that risk to push her too much and she gets injured again.

Goalkeeper Ramsey will leave the group prior to departure for Australia.\n\n\"Of course [Le Tissier] was really close,\" said Wiegman. \"That was a hard call. With all the defenders we had to think about it.\n\n\"She just didn't get there. She has had a very good season at Manchester United.\"\n\nWhile there was bitter disappointment for Le Tissier, England received her first call up for a year and was rewarded for her goalscoring form since making the January switch from Chelsea.\n\n\"She is selected because of her performances. She was at Chelsea and didn't build that much credit because we hardly saw her play,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"But then she made a move, and how she did, performed and the resilience she showed made us make the decision to get her in the squad.\"\n\n'Bright will be fine as captain'\n\nAside from selection, another talking point was who would take over the captaincy from Williamson in her injury absence.\n\nBright was named vice-captain for Euro 2022 and Wiegman confirmed she will wear the armband in Australia.\n\n\"I haven't told her she would be the captain, that's how we've been all the time,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"Where she is at right now in her rehab, we haven't really spoken about it yet. She will be fine, she has done it before.\"\n\nAnother question was whether Aston Villa forward Rachel Daly, who was the WSL's Player of the Season and top goalscorer, would play up front in the tournament having started every game at left-back at Euro 2022.\n\n\"Yes, she can, like some other players. She has had a very good season and done really well,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"She has played for us as a number nine and at the back. Her versatility helps the team.\"\n\nWiegman's decision to name 23 players is also different from last summer's home Euros, where she had a longlist of 28 names initially.\n\n\"It has to do with the timescale and going to the other side of the world,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"While we were in England we could have training all the time and give clarity.

Foreign Minister James Cleverly said options to evacuate the remaining British nationals in Sudan were \"severely limited\".\n\nMore than 1,000 European Union citizens had been taken out of Sudan, according to an update from the EU's foreign policy chief on Monday morning.\n\nIndividual countries have given updates on their evacuation operations:\n\nEarlier, more than 150 people - mostly citizens of Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Pakistan and Canada - were evacuated by sea to the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah.\n\nLong lines of United Nations vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, heading east towards Port Sudan on the Red Sea and carrying \"citizens from all over the world\", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency.\n\nSouth African diplomat Clayson Monyela said ongoing fighting meant that all routes out of Khartoum were \"risky and dangerous\".\n\n\"The airport remains closed, the fighting continues,\" he told the BBC. \"This is why we continue to call for a ceasefire to allow for a safe passage for those who want to get out and to allow for humanitarian aid.\"\n\nThere have been desperate calls for help from many foreign students - from Africa, Asia and the Middle East - who are also stuck in Khartoum, a city of some six million people.\n\nA Nigerian student association in Sudan called on its government to conduct an \"immediate rescue mission\", saying many students had chosen to flee.\n\nMeanwhile, internet monitoring group NetBlocks said Sudan was in the midst of an \"internet blackout\", with connectivity at 2% of ordinary levels, which could seriously hinder the coordination of help for those trapped in Khartoum and other cities.\n\nThe power struggle has seen heavy bombardment in the capital city, with hundreds killed and thousands more injured.\n\nThe near-constant shooting and bombing in Khartoum and elsewhere has cut electricity and safe access to food and water for much of the population.\n\nSeveral ceasefires that had seemingly been agreed by both sides were ignored, including a three-day pause to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Friday.\n\nOn Sunday, the US announced a disaster response team would be sent to the area to \"coordinate the humanitarian response for those in need both within and outside of Sudan.\"\n\nSamantha Power from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the team would work out of Kenya at first, and prioritise getting \"life-saving humanitarian assistance to those who need it most.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization says the fighting has killed more than 400 people and injured thousands. But the death toll is believed to be much higher as people are struggling to get healthcare, as most of the city's hospitals have been forced to close by the fighting.\n\nAlong with Khartoum, the western region of Darfur - where the RSF first emerged - has also been badly affected by the fighting.\n\nThe UN has warned that up to 20,000 people - mostly women and children - have fled Sudan to seek safety in Chad, across the border from Darfur.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAre you are foreign citizen in Sudan?

This work will be carried out as quickly as possible and we will be happy to share the outcome.\"\n\nThe letter was addressed to Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage, and Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes.\n\nThe letter mentions the \"significant media coverage concerning Phillip Schofield\" and adds: \"As you would expect we take the matter extremely seriously and have reviewed our own records over the weekend.\"\n\nThe broadcast network reiterated that it investigated rumours of a relationship in 2020, but \"did not find any evidence of a relationship beyond hearsay and rumour\".\n\nPhillip Schofield presented This Morning opposite Holly Willoughby until his exit last week\n\n\"Given the ongoing rumours, we continued to ask questions of both parties, who both continued to deny the rumours, including as recently as this month,\" the letter added.\n\nDame Carolyn said there had been \"a lot of inaccuracy\" in reporting, adding the former employee Schofield admitted to an affair with had been offered support by the broadcaster.\n\nShe said: \"The ITV employee was aged 19 when he first did work experience at This Morning... and 20 years old when he applied and succeeded in securing a job as a runner on the show.\"\n\n\"As you would imagine given the social media scrutiny of him, we have offered him our support throughout this period and indeed are still doing so,\" the letter continued.\n\nITV bosses, including Dame Carolyn, are set to face MPs on the Commons DCMS Committee on Tuesday to discuss reforms to the laws governing public broadcasting, and Dame Carolyn has also been asked to face questions from MPs at a session of the committee on 14 June.\n\nMP John Nicolson, a former BBC journalist who sits on the committee and is also the SNP's culture spokesman, said on Twitter that recent events at ITV were a \"cause for concern\" and that he was looking forward to \"getting some answers\" from ITV bosses.\n\nSchofield was dropped as an ambassador for the Prince's Trust earlier this week\n\nSchofield left his role on This Morning following reports of a rift with his co-star Holly Willoughby.\n\nDays later, he confirmed he had had a relationship with a younger male employee, which took place while Schofield was still married to his wife Stephanie Lowe.\n\nSchofield apologised for lying to his colleagues, the media and his friends and family about the affair, and left ITV with immediate effect.\n\nEarlier this week, the Prince's Trust announced it was dropping Schofield as an ambassador following the controversy.\n\nThe charity, founded by the King, said it was \"no longer appropriate\" for it to work with the presenter.\n\nSchofield's exit from ITV means he will no longer present the British Soap Awards this weekend. They will now be hosted by singer and presenter Jane McDonald.\n\nHe will also not front a new prime-time series which the network said last week they were developing with him.\n\nDr Ranj Singh, who used to work on This Morning, alleged there was a toxic environment on the show\n\nThe show's former resident doctor, Dr Ranj Singh, previously criticised the show's \"toxic\" culture, saying he raised concerns about \"bullying and discrimination\" two years ago when he worked there.\n\nIn its latest letter, ITV said that an external review conducted following a complaint made by Dr Ranj found \"no evidence of bullying or discrimination\".\n\n\"We were sorry to read his statement,\" the letter said. \"We are fully committed to providing every opportunity for anyone who works with us to raise any concern or comments they may have.\n\n\"Following a complaint made by Dr Ranj, we appointed an external and independent adviser to carry out a review. This external review found no evidence of bullying or discrimination.\"", "Like many performers, comedian Robin Grainger hoped that the Edinburgh Fringe might be a springboard to stardom.\n\nThat may have looked unlikely when he only sold a single ticket for his show last year - but his decision to go ahead with the gig changed the course of his career.\n\nRobin knew the show must go on, so he went out on stage and brought a whole new meaning to the term one-man show.\n\nWhat happened next was the stuff of Fringe folklore.\n\nRobin, from Portsoy in Aberdeenshire, gave it his all - and by chance comedy reviewer Kate Copstick was waiting outside to watch the next performer.\n\nCommenting to a staff member that the gig sounded like it was going well, she was told there was one person in the audience. She was so impressed that Robin had gone ahead with the show that she tweeted about it.\n\nWhen BBC Scotland News picked up on the story, the tale went viral and before he knew it, Robin was a festival legend.\n\n\"It went mad,\" Robin said. \"The story went all over the world. I did 60 to 70 media interviews - 50 of them in the first week.\n\n\"And I sold out my Fringe shows.\n\n\"Off the back of that I went on a mini tour of the UK last year.\"\n\nRobin ended up doing a mini tour on the back of his Fringe success last year\n\nAnd - he said - \"weird stuff\" started to happen.\n\n\"Companies sent me clothes for free. And people sent me pictures of newspaper articles about me in Germany.\n\n\"Someone - a nurse - drew a portrait of me. And people would ask me for selfies.\n\n\"When I was doing a show in Newcastle a man was almost hit by a car running across the road to get a selfie - it's still baffling to me.\n\n\"Even now, every couple of days someone will still message me saying they heard of what happened. From places like Australia and Portugal.\"\n\nHe was even the subject of BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme's Thought For The Day slot.\n\nRobin is back at this year's Fringe. He is higher up the bill and has already sold 100 times the number of tickets he shifted for that first gig of his run last year.\n\nHis fan base is building - and includes the solitary man who came to see that show in 2022.\n\nRobin now counts radio executive Mike Cass as a friend, and he even features on the flyer of his 2023 show.\n\nMike travelled to Edinburgh to star in the flyer image for Robin's new show\n\n\"An audient with Robin Grainger\" throws back to Kate Copstick's review, where she called Mike the \"audient\" - which means hearer, the singular term for an audience.\n\nRobin said: \"I had the idea to get the biggest venue I could and have one person sat in the audience for the photo.\n\n\"The Playhouse let us use it and Mike agreed to travel up from Leicester just to have the photo taken in an empty Playhouse.\n\n\"He also surprised me on the last day of the tour, sneaking in to the back of the room.\n\n\"I asked him why he didn't heckle me and his comeback was: 'I wanted to see what the show was like with an audience'.\"\n\nThe events of last August have inspired more than the new show's title.\n\nRobin talks about what transpired at The Stand 2 in Edinburgh but the main theme of the show is overcoming fear.\n\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"Last year I conquered the biggest fear as a comedian - not having an audience.\n\n\"I think I am a lot less scared of things now that I am not scared of a single-person gig any more.\n\n\"Now the routine is about conquering other fears. If you can get over that you can get over bigger things.\n\n\"I look at body image, feeling awkward, school days, mortality and grief.\n\n\"So far it has really connected with people - even the darker bits. I was worried about speaking about things like that but it has been well received because I think there is more relief when you can have a chuckle.\"\n\nRobin Grainger and his \"audient\" Mike Cass bonded after the show\n\nRobin's new fans include comedians Chris Ramsay, and Kevin Bridges and Iain Stirling both recommended the show on social media.\n\nHe can't believe he has sold tickets before the Fringe has even started.\n\nAnd while he may not be expecting to perform for one person, he still hopes he will get a boost from the run.\n\n\"I'm proud of this show. I'd love to do a wee tour after it. I'll just continue to try to build my audience and perform to as many people as possible.\"\n\nKate Copstick told BBC Scotland she was glad Robin used the platform he was given.\n\n\"I genuinely love it when I can help the unknown people, the weirdos, the risky guys,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to keep comedy crazy and wonderful and personal. Find another name for the corporate, industrialised, stuff.\n\n\"If Robin ever goes there, I will hunt him down and hurt him.

I just want to make that clear.\"\n\nDistrict judge Sunil Khanna said he was satisfied there was a need for the order to protect from stalking - and warned Belfield he could face further jail time if he breached it.\n\nBelfield was a presenter at BBC Radio Leeds before running his own YouTube channel\n\nHe also made an order requiring Belfield to pay costs after barrister Christopher Pembridge said the case, which has been going on for three years, had cost police \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Pembridge said it would be \"unjust\" for Belfield to pay the full costs, but asked the judge to consider an appropriate amount.\n\nDavid Aubrey KC, representing Belfield, said his client should not shoulder substantial costs as his ability to work following his release from prison would be limited.\n\n\"[Belfield] is in prison and on the question of his earning capacity when he comes out of prison, there could be restrictions on what work he could do,\" he said.\n\n\"It is very much up in the air and will depend on what happens upon his release eventually.\"\n\nBelfield made videos throughout his trial and posted them on YouTube\n\nAt Belfield's sentencing in September, the judge made restraining orders in relation to all of the complainants, including those he was not convicted of stalking.\n\nDet Con Janet Percival, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: \"It's been a long hard slog, but we've now managed to secure these significant orders which will provide peace of mind for these two victims who were caused genuine alarm and distress by Belfield.\n\n\"I understand that people can be reluctant to contact us - sometimes because they aren't sure that what's happening is serious enough to warrant police action, and sometimes because they feel we won't be able to help - but I can assure them that we will take their reports seriously and we will do whatever we can to help and protect them.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

It will be a lonely, isolating and frightening time for her.\"\n\nThe jury were given the option to consider an alternative verdict of infanticide if they believed she killed Stanley while the balance of her mind was disturbed.\n\nHowever, Mayo, of Ruardean in Gloucestershire, cried in the dock on Friday as jurors delivered a majority guilty verdict on the charge of murder.\n\nMayo's trial was told she had a difficult family life and started having sex at 13 so people would like her\n\nDuring summing up Mr Justice Garnham rejected the suggestion the murder was committed \"with significant pre-planning\".\n\nHe added that Mayo had not spent her time covering up her pregnancy, but in March 2019 had found herself \"facing a reality you had spent nine months telling yourself could not be true\".\n\nHowever, he said the combination of a two-stone weight gain and the lack of periods for eight months meant she \"must have known\" she was pregnant and \"rapidly approaching your time for giving birth\".\n\nDespite that, the judge said Mayo \"told no one, and sought no help\".\n\n\"You did not even tell your mother who you accepted in court would, at least after the initial shock, have been supportive,\" he said.\n\n\"I find as a fact that almost as soon as Stanley was born, you had decided you could not allow him to live.\"\n\nThe judge also used his sentencing remarks to criticise a prosecution expert witness, describing forensic psychiatrist Dr Duncan Harding's \"inflexibility of thinking\" while giving evidence as \"unhelpful\".\n\n\"He had told the police that you ought to be prosecuted, a surprising opinion for an expert called to give evidence on a defendant's mental state to express,\" Mr justice Garnham said.\n\nIt was apparent he had a \"clear and unshakeable view on your culpability from the time of his very first meeting with you.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said the case had been both \"tragic and complex\".\n\nStanley's \"short life was filled with pain and suffering when he should have been nurtured and loved\".\n\n\"[Mayo] chose to hide her pregnancy, give birth alone and kill her baby, then hide his body, despite accepting that she had a family who would have supported her.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Spears recoils, as she appears to hit herself.\n\nWembanyama has said he \"didn't see what happened\", but that someone was pushed.\n\nThe 19-year-old NBA top draft pick was in Las Vegas ahead of his first Summer League game when he visited a restaurant at the Aria, on South Las Vegas Boulevard, where Spears said she spotted him.\n\n\"I decided to approach him and congratulate him on his success.

And the second is, as we set out in our national security review, China represents the largest state-based threat to economic security.\n\n\"So it's not a surprise that we should look carefully at Chinese transactions. But equally, we look across the board.\"\n\nChinese firms have been targeted by regulators around the world in the last few years amid concerns that the Chinese state might use them for spying purposes.\n\nProminent examples include telecoms giant Huawei, which was banned in 2020 from the UK's 5G mobile networks - a decision mirrored by other countries.\n\nLast year, Chinese-owned social media app TikTok was banned on UK government devices as part of a security review.\n\nIn the report, Mr Dowden said the National Security and Investment Act was meant to be \"light touch\", incentivising investment in the UK, while also protecting national security \"in an increasingly volatile world\".\n\nHe told the BBC that by blocking or imposing remedies on deals, foreign investors would have more confidence to invest in Britain \"because they know it's safe\".\n\n\"But at the same time, we cannot find ourselves in a situation where we totally decouple from an economy like China's, it's not in our national interest in terms of jobs and prosperity,\" he said.\n\n\"What we have to do is de-risk that engagement.

They [the Taliban] keep saying they will open schools. But it's been almost two years now. I don't believe them. It breaks my heart,\" says 17-year-old Habiba.\n\nShe blinks and bites her lip trying hard not to tear up.\n\nHabiba and her former classmates Mahtab and Tamana are among hundreds of thousands of teenage girls who have been barred from attending secondary school in most of Afghanistan by the Taliban - the only country to take such action.\n\nOne-and-a-half years since their lives were brought to a halt, their grief is still raw.\n\nThe girls say they fear that global outrage over what's happened to them is fading, even though they live with the pain every day - intensified this week when another school term started without them.\n\n\"When I see the boys going to school and doing whatever they want, it really hurts me. I feel very bad. When I see my brother leaving for school, I feel broken,\" says Tamana. Her voice trembles and tears roll down her cheeks but she goes on.\n\n\"Earlier, my brother used to say I won't go to school without you. I hugged him and said you go, I'll join you later.\n\n\"People tell my parents you shouldn't worry, you have sons. I wish we had the same rights.\"\n\nThere was a little freedom at the beginning, but gradually that changed\n\nAny hopes they might have had of schools being reopened have been dented by the increasing restrictions the Taliban government has imposed on women.\n\n\"There was a little freedom at the beginning, but gradually that changed,\" Habiba says.\n\nThe first restriction following the secondary school ban came in December 2021, when the Taliban ordered that women would have to be accompanied by a male relative if travelling more than 72km (48 miles).\n\nIn March 2022, the Taliban government announced that secondary schools would reopen for girls, only to close them within hours.\n\nLess than two months later, a decree was passed that women would have to wear clothing that covered them from head to toe, including a face veil.\n\nIn November, women and girls were barred from parks, gyms and swimming pools. Girls were no longer allowed to choose subjects such as economics, engineering and journalism at university.\n\nA month later, a massive blow was delivered when universities were closed to female students, and women were banned from working in domestic and international NGOs except those in the health sector.\n\nLife has no meaning without education. I think death is better than a life like this\n\n\"If these limitations increase, I don't think this life is worth living anymore for women. We don't have access to our basic rights as human beings. Life has no meaning without education. I think death is better than a life like this,\" Mahtab says.\n\nMahtab had been injured in a bombing at Sayed Ul-Shuhada school in May 2021, when the Taliban were fighting the forces of the previous government of Afghanistan.\n\n\"I had injuries on my neck, face and foot. They were painful. But I was determined to continue studying,\" she says. \"I even attended my mid-term exam, but soon after the Taliban came and it was all over.\"\n\nThe Taliban have said that schools and universities are only temporarily closed to women and girls until a \"suitable environment\" can be created. It is evident that there are divisions within the Taliban government on the issue, but so far any efforts by those who believe girls should be allowed to study have yielded no results.\n\nRegarding some of the other restrictions, the Taliban say they were imposed because women were not wearing a hijab (head covering) or following Islamic laws. Enforcement of the Taliban's rules isn't uniform across provinces, but the regulations create an environment of fear and confusion.\n\n\"We always wear a hijab. But it doesn't make a difference. What do they mean? I don't understand,\" Tamana says.\n\nIn our time in Afghanistan before and after the Taliban takeover, we have never met an Afghan woman not wearing a hijab.\n\nWhen I see my brother leaving for school, I feel broken\n\nTo counter the shrinking public spaces for women, Laila Basim had co-founded a library for women in Kabul which we visited in November last year. Thousands of books were neatly stacked on shelves that covered three walls of the room. Women came in to read books, and sometimes just to meet each other - an escape from being indoors in their homes.\n\nNow the library is closed.\n\n\"Twice when the Taliban shut the library, we managed to reopen it. But the threats increased day by day. I got phone calls saying how dare I open a library for women. Once they came to the library and told women that they had no right to read books,\" says Laila. \"It became too risky to run it, so I had to take the inevitable decision to shut it down.\"\n\nLaila Basim has closed the women's library since this photo was taken in November\n\nShe says she will continue to find other means to fight the Taliban's policies.\n\n\"Of course, I am scared, but the closure of the library is not the end of the road. There are other approaches through which we can raise the voices of Afghan women. It is difficult and will require sacrifices, but we have started it and are committed to it,\" she adds.\n\nFor women who are the only earning members of their families, it's hard to even get from day to day.\n\nMeera (name changed) is a widow in her mid-forties. She used to work as a cleaner at a girls' school, supporting her family of 10. She lost her job when the school closed, and, amid an economic crisis in the country, she's not found much work since.\n\nShe now begs on the streets of Kabul.\n\n\"I feel like I'm not alive. People know I have nothing so they try to help me out. It is better to die than to live a life without dignity,\" she says, weeping inconsolably. \"If I get potatoes one day, I peel them and cook them. The next day I cook the peelings to feed my family.\"\n\nEven amid her struggles, Meera wishes her daughters could go to school.\n\n\"If they could be educated, they could get jobs. One of my daughters wants to study law and another wants to study medicine. I tell them that I will find money for their education, even if I have to beg for it, but they can't go to university because the Taliban don't allow it,\" she adds.\n\n\"There is nothing except pain or sorrow in every house now,\" she says.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNine people have been detained over an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in north-west China which has killed at least 31 people.\n\nA gas leak is suspected to have caused the explosion in Yinchuan city on Wednesday night local time.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has called for \"all-out efforts\" in the rescue and an investigation into the blast.\n\nThe owner of the Fuyang Barbecue Restaurant was among those in custody, state media reported.\n\nThe explosion occurred on the eve of the three-day Dragon Boat Festival holiday in China, a time when many families and friends gather for celebratory meals.\n\nSeveral high school students and retirees were among the dead, local media reported.\n\nThe death toll is expected to rise with at least seven people injured, one of whom is in a critical condition, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has called for maximum efforts in treating the wounded and boosting safety measures.\n\n\"We must do our best to rescue the injured and reassure the families of the casualties, identify the cause of the accident as soon as possible, and seriously pursue responsibility according to the law,\" Mr Xi said.\n\nThe restaurant is part of a cluster of eateries and entertainment venues in downtown Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia autonomous region.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV aired footage of more than a dozen firefighters fighting the blaze as smoke poured out of a gaping hole in the restaurant's facade.

It was amazing how calm I felt.\"\n\nBelgium's Brecel had dominated the opening session with his flamboyant attacking style to open up a 6-2 advantage.\n\nHowever, Selby, who appeared jaded on Sunday afternoon as a consequence of the draining late-night finish to his semi-final victory over Mark Allen, delivered a superb riposte in an exhilarating second session.\n\nA high-quality start saw Selby finally display his devastating potting ability, opening with a 134 break and then a 96 as he reeled off three of the first four frames.\n\nBrecel, who crafted a brilliant 99 of his own in the 10th frame of the match, constructed back-to-back half centuries to re-establish a four-frame lead at 9-5.\n\nBut Selby again responded, pinching the final frame of the session after his 147 to leave snooker's blue-riband event delicately poised when play resumes at 13:00 BST on Monday.\n\nSelby's special effort arrived in the 16th frame of the match, with the Englishman coming to the table after Brecel had left a red hanging in the jaws of the bottom corner pocket.\n\nAs excitement built he went on to superbly pot a difficult final red with the rest to clear all 15 reds, all accompanied by blacks, before dispatching the colours.\n\nIt prompted joyous scenes as the fans inside the auditorium erupted.\n\nReferee Brendan Moore, officiating in his third and last Crucible final before retirement, congratulated Selby, who was also embraced warmly by Brecel.\n\nSelby's feat comes 40 years on from the first ever maximum at the Crucible, compiled by Cliff Thorburn in 1983.\n\nThe Englishman is the 10th player to achieve a total clearance at the Sheffield venue - Kyren Wilson also made a 147 earlier in the tournament.\n\nThere have been 14 maximums in total at the Crucible with Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry making three each.\n\nThe select band of players to reach the magical tally is completed by Cliff Thorburn, Jimmy White, Mark Williams, Ali Carter, John Higgins and Neil Robertson.\n\nWilson's 147 came during his 10-5 first-round win against Ryan Day.\n\nSelby is set to share with him an additional \u00a355,000 in prize money, with \u00a340,000 on offer for a 147 and \u00a315,000 for the tournament's highest break.\n\nIt was amazing, to be here and have a bird's eye view of it, it's a magical moment in Crucible history.\n\nTo make a maximum in a final is just the icing on the cake for Mark Selby in his career.\n\nPhenomenal. Iconic pictures. The irony that during the interval we were running a piece about Cliff Thorburn [making the Crucible's first maximum in 1983] and celebrating the anniversary of that, to then a couple of frames later [for Selby to make one].\n\nIt was absolutely amazing.

Humza Yousaf said he was not prepared to put companies at a competitive disadvantage\n\nThe first minister has told the BBC he is struggling to see how Scotland's deposit return scheme can go ahead without the UK government's support.\n\nHumza Yousaf has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asking him to agree to include glass bottles in the scheme.\n\nHe has set Monday as a deadline for a response and agreed that this was \"effectively\" an ultimatum.\n\nThe UK government said deposit return schemes should be consistent UK-wide.\n\nIn his letter to the prime minister, Mr Yousaf accused the UK government of placing the deposit return scheme (DRS) in \"grave danger\".\n\nHe said the demands would have a \"significant impact\" on business.\n\nThe administrator of Scotland's DRS, Circularity Scotland, has now urged the UK and Scottish governments to \"get round the table\" to deliver the programme.\n\nThe UK government wrote to the Scottish government last week granting a partial exemption to the Internal Market Act which would exclude glass containers from the DRS - which is due to go live in Scotland in March next year.\n\nMr Yousaf has urged a rethink from the UK government, citing concerns from one of Scotland's biggest brewers.\n\n\"The removal of glass fundamentally threatens the viability of Scotland's DRS with reduced revenue for the scheme administrator,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Removing glass will also have a significant impact on business.\n\n\"For example, C&C Group - owners of the iconic Tennent's brand - has been explicit that the decision by the UK government to remove glass threatens investment and jobs.\n\n\"Other Scottish businesses have raised similar concerns privately with us.\"\n\nThe Scottish government wants to include glass bottles in its plans\n\nMr Yousaf later told BBC Scotland Tennent's had said that, apart from threatening jobs and investment, excluding glass would also put the company at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to do that,\" he said. \"The Scottish government will not be prepared to do that and now that we've heard from these companies I'm saying to the prime minister it's very simple - you agree to include glass in the scheme or I'm afraid I struggle to see how the scheme can go ahead because I will not put Scottish businesses at that disadvantage.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said he hoped the UK government would listen and agree to provide the Scottish government with the necessary exemption from the Internal Market Act.\n\nThe UK government's move sparked another constitutional row between Edinburgh and London, with the first minister writing in his letter to Mr Sunak: \"There are much wider consequences of the decision.\n\n\"This UK government intervention at such a late stage demonstrates a major erosion of the devolution settlement.\n\n\"I urge you to revoke the conditions set out in your letter and grant a full exclusion for Scotland's DRS, to be implemented as per the regulations agreed by the Scottish Parliament in this area of devolved competence.\n\n\"Without this, the Scottish government is not prepared to put Scottish businesses at a competitive disadvantage due to the last-minute demands the UK government has made.\n\n\"There is little doubt your government's action have put the future of DRS in grave danger, not only in Scotland but also in the rest of the UK due to the damage to consumer and investor confidence.\"\n\nIt is looking increasingly likely that the deposit return scheme will be scrapped.\n\nThe Scottish government wants the scheme to cover glass bottles, plastic bottles and drinks cans.\n\nBut the UK government has an effective veto - it needs to provide the Scottish government with an appropriate exemption from the Internal Market Act which is designed to ensure there are no barriers to trade within Britain.\n\nThe UK government is only prepared to offer an exemption covering plastic bottles and drinks cans.\n\nHumza Yousaf hopes the UK government will listen to Holyrood and provide that wider exemption.\n\nBut there seems to be no chance of that happening by Monday.\n\nIf the scheme is dropped, supporters of the Scottish government will argue it is the result of an attack on devolution itself and the rights of the Scottish parliament,\n\nBut critics will say the problem could have been foreseen.\n\nAnother of the conditions placed on the scheme was the insurance of \"interoperability\" between the Scottish scheme and the anticipated English DRS, which is intended to launch in October 2025.\n\nThe first minister conceded the ability for the schemes to work together where possible would be \"desirable\", but added that the UK government was \"unable to provide the operational details required to allow the schemes to be interoperable\" due to it being at such an early stage.\n\n\"Businesses need certainty and they need it now - not in two years time when the UK government scheme potentially, hopefully launches,\" he added.\n\n\"The UK government has significantly undermined the clarity and certainty that businesses unanimously tell us they need.\"\n\nMr Yousaf also pointed out that the UK government had intended to include glass in the English DRS from 2019 right up until March 2022 - two years after regulations were passed by the Scottish Parliament.\n\n\"We planned our scheme on this basis,\" he said.\n\nThe first minister added that as late as January 2023, the UK government confirmed that it was for devolved governments to decide the scope of their DRS.\n\n\"The Welsh government's stated intention has been to include glass in their DRS, meaning that it is the English scheme which is out of step with the design of other UK schemes,\" Mr Yousaf said.\n\nThe first minister asked for a response from Downing Street by Monday to allow for the issue to be discussed by the Scottish Cabinet the following day and to update Holyrood.\n\nThe DRS would see customers given money back by returning empty bottles\n\nThe Scotland Office said it would respond to the first minister's letter in due course, with a spokeswoman adding: \"The government remains unwavering in its commitment to improving the environment while also upholding the UK's internal market.\n\n\"The drinks industry has raised concerns about the Scottish government's DRS differing from plans in the rest of the UK, resulting in the Scottish government reviewing and pausing their scheme earlier this year.\n\n\"We have listened to these concerns and that is why we have accepted the Scottish government's request for a UK internal market (UKIM) exclusion on a temporary and limited basis to ensure the Scottish government's scheme aligns with planned schemes for the rest of the UK.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added: \"Deposit return schemes need to be consistent across the UK and this is the best way to provide a simple and effective system.\n\n\"A system with the same rules for the whole UK will increase recycling collection rates and reduce litter - as well as minimise disruption to the drinks industry and ensure simplicity for consumers.\"\n\nA spokesman for Scotland's DRS administrator said: \"Circularity Scotland, our members and business and industry partners have invested around \u00a3300m to develop a deposit return scheme and have done so at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\n\"This scheme will be ready to launch in March 2024 and will be a platform for a scaled-up and interoperable pan-UK scheme.\n\n\"We urge both governments to urgently get round the table and agree a pathway for integrated and harmonised deposit return schemes across the UK.\n\n\"Without this agreement, investment and public confidence will be seriously damaged, jeopardising credibility for investment in any future major environmental projects.\"\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said: \"Issuing this ultimatum is a cynical and transparent attempt to create a constitutional spat to divert attention from another unravelling SNP-Green policy.\n\n\"The reality is that DRS has been an utter shambles from the start - and nationalist ministers only applied for an internal market act exemption at the very last minute.\n\n\"Retailers have no confidence that the SNP-Greens can deliver the efficient recycling system that we all want to see.\"", "Terri Harris (bottom left) and her children John Bennett (top left) and Lacey Bennett (bottom right) were killed along with Lacey's friend Connie Gent (top right)\n\nAn inquest will be held to examine wider issues around how a man murdered a mother and three children after being given a suspended prison sentence.\n\nDamien Bendall killed his pregnant partner Terri Harris and her two children, along with another child, at a home in Killamarsh in Derbyshire.\n\nA review into how he was assessed and managed by probation officers found failings \"at every stage\".\n\nHowever, the inquest will also look at issues beyond this.\n\n\"There is potential for the inquest to be led by the probation report,\" coroner Peter Nieto said.\n\n\"I want to avoid the inquest simply being a re-run of the report.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Killamarsh murders: Footage shows arrest of man who murdered four\n\nMr Nieto was speaking at a pre-inquest review, held at Chesterfield Coroner's Court on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the hearing, he listed several issues that are likely to be examined when a full inquest is held at a later date. These include:\n\nPolice found Ms Harris and the three children dead at the house in Chandos Crescent\n\nBendall was given a suspended sentence for arson just three months before the murders in September 2021.\n\nIf he had been sent to prison instead, he would not have been able to kill Ms Harris, her 13-year-old son John Bennett, 11-year-old daughter Lacey Bennett, and Lacey's 11-year-old friend Connie Gent.\n\nHe used a claw hammer to murder his victims, and he also raped Lacey.\n\nAccording to an independent Serious Further Offence (SFO) review, probation failings began in June 2021, when Bendall was assessed by a probation officer prior to being sentenced for arson.\n\nThe probation officer wrote a pre-sentence report to help the judge decide the most suitable sentence. However, the officer was \"relatively inexperienced\" and the quality of the report was \"very poor\", according to the review.\n\nFor example, the significant level of violence used by Bendall during his previous offending was \"not sufficiently examined\".\n\nHis previous convictions comprised a robbery in 2010, which left the victim unconscious, using a knife during an attempted robbery in 2015, and attacking three prison officers in 2016, which left one needing surgery and months of physical rehabilitation.\n\nDamien Bendall admitted four murders and the rape of 11-year-old Lacey\n\nThe judge, Jason Taylor QC, gave Bendall a 17-month custodial sentence but suspended it for two years, and gave him a five-month curfew so that he was tagged and could not leave Ms Harris's home at certain times.\n\nThe judge told Bendall: \"I do not think for a second that you are going to come back to court. I really hope now you have turned [over] a new leaf and I hope you can carry on with the new chapter in your life.\"\n\nThe report into the probation service's handling of Bendall said: \"Had DB's [Damien Bendall's] risk of serious harm to the public and children been correctly assessed as high, and had his risk of serious harm to partners been correctly assessed as medium, the court may not have curfewed him to an address with Ms Harris and her children.\"\n\nBendall was given a whole-life order for the murders and rape in December, meaning he will never be released.\n\nThe coroner has not set a date for the inquest, but indicated it could take place in September.\n\nAnother pre-inquest review could also be held before then.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"These were appalling crimes. The Chief Probation Officer has apologised to the victims' families for the unacceptable failings in this case and disciplinary action has been taken against two members of staff.\n\n\"The extra funding of \u00a3155m a year we have put into the Probation Service is being used to recruit thousands more front-line staff and to ensure domestic abuse and child safeguarding checks are always carried out before any offender in any case is given a curfew.\n\n\"The Probation Service has also improved information sharing with police and councils, so no family is put at such significant risk again.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

The chancellor told MPs on Wednesday that the UK's full response to IRA would be made in full after the EU responded. Andy Palmer's response about the entire industry under threat without \"a British Inflation Reduction Act\" shows how significant the stakes are.\n\nThe car industry is undergoing a massive transformation as governments across the world look to move away from using fossil fuels, meaning traditional petrol and diesel vehicle combustion engines are to become a thing of the past.\n\nA part of plans to cut carbon emissions, the government has said sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK by 2030.\n\nBut there are concerns that firms are not getting enough state support in the journey to electric cars becoming mainstream.\n\nIn recent years, Honda has closed its Swindon car plant, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. However, BMW is understood to preparing to invest up to \u00a3600m in its Mini plant in Cowley, Oxford, for building electric models, though no final decision has been announced.\n\nIn December last year, the number of new cars made in the UK sank to its lowest level since 1956, but in February car production rose 13.1% on the same month in 2022.\n\nThe SMMT said Britain had a \"firm foundation\" for expanding the production of electric vehicles, but warned \"we must not squander these advantages\".\n\nThe government said it was providing support through existing schemes.\n\nIt said Nissan and Envision investing \u00a31bn to create an electric vehicle factory in Sunderland was an example of car manufacturers \"choosing the UK thanks to our competitive investment environment\".\n\nBut Mr Palmer, who played a role in the launch of the Nissan Leaf car, said firms were \"bound to look at where the biggest subsidies are coming from\" while making investment decisions.\n\n\"If you're not prepared to compete, then you'll have to start managing decline,\" he said.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

No one can understand just how deep that break is.\"\n\nMr Paisley said he understood the police would hold a press conference on Monday.", "Sanna Marin was pleased with her party's performance but it was Petteri Orpo's night\n\n\"We got the biggest mandate,\" said the leader of the National Coalition Party, after a dramatic night in which the result gradually swung away from Ms Marin's Social Democrats.\n\nMr Orpo secured 20.8% of the vote, ahead of the right-wing populist Finns Party and the centre left.\n\nIt is a bitter defeat for Ms Marin, who increased her party's seats and secured 19.9% of the vote.\n\nShe continues to enjoy high poll ratings and has been widely praised for steering Finland towards imminent entry into Nato and navigating her country through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShortly after the conservative leader claimed victory, the centre-left leader conceded the election.\n\n\"Congratulations to the winner of the elections, congratulations to the National Coalition Party, congratulations to the Finns Party. Democracy has spoken,\" she told supporters.\n\nFor weeks the three parties had been almost level in the polls, and as the results came in it became too close to call. Then a projection from public broadcaster YLE gave Petteri Orpo's National Coalition victory with the biggest number of seats in parliament.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Petteri Orpo, who must now form a majority coalition, speaks after election win\n\n\"I think Finnish people want change. They want change and now I will start negotiations, open negotiations with all parties,\" he said.\n\nThere was a mood of euphoria in the camp, said Matti Koivisto, political correspondent with public broadcaster YLE. \"When they saw the projection, it was quite clear they were going to win.\"\n\nFinns Party leader Riikka Purra congratulated her centre-right rival and was herself delighted with the best result in her party's history.\n\n\"We're still challenging to be number one, but seven more seats is an excellent result.\"\n\nThe Finns underlined their success by winning more regions than any other party in mainland Finland. Riikka Purra won more votes than any other candidate and commentators highlighted her party's appeal to young voters by reaching out over social media such as TikTok.\n\nMeanwhile, three of the other parties in the outgoing coalition - the Centre Party, Left Alliance and Greens - all rang up big losses.\n\nNow 37, Sanna Marin became the world's youngest leader when she burst on to the political scene in 2019. She headed a coalition of five parties, all led by women.\n\nDespite her successful response to neighbouring Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the election was largely fought on Finland's economy and public debt as all the mainstream parties backed Nato membership. Finland officially becomes Nato's 31st member on Tuesday.\n\nMany Finns see Ms Marin as a polarising figure. She came under heavy scrutiny last year when a video emerged of her singing, dancing and drinking at a party. Supporters said the controversy was steeped in sexism and women across Finland and the world shared videos of themselves dancing in solidarity.\n\nPetteri Orpo by contrast has none of Sanna Marin's \"rock-star\" qualities, says YLE's Matti Koivisto.\n\n\"He's a career politician. He's been in the game since the 1990s and he's quite stable and calm. There is criticism that maybe he's too dull and calm, but it also works quite well in Finland.\"\n\nThe conservatives will have the first opportunity in forming a government, and if they succeed, Mr Orpo, 53, will become the next prime minister.\n\nUnder an Orpo-led government, Europe could expect a pro-European conservative from the liberal centre of his party with an emphasis on economic policy.\n\nLess exciting than Sanna Marin and very moderate, says Vesa Vares, professor of contemporary history at the University of Turku: \"A sort of dream son-in-law.\"\n\nUnder Finland's system of proportional representation he will have to muster more than 100 seats in the 200-seat parliament to run the country, and that will not be straightforward.\n\nMr Orpo really has two choices ahead of him, either forming a right-wing coalition with Riikka Purra's nationalist Finns Party or reaching an agreement with Sanna Marin's Social Democrats.\n\n\"The Finns are a very difficult partner because they're so inexperienced and they have MPs who are discontented towards almost anything,\" says Prof Vares.\n\n\"The most natural thing would be to co-operate with the Social Democrats. But [Sanna Marin] used to belong to her party's left wing and it's obvious she doesn't like the conservatives.\"\n\nPolitics researcher Jenni Karimaki of the University of Helsinki also points out that Ms Marin has been reluctant to say what her aspirations are.\n\nThe Social Democrats have mixed feelings, she says, because while they increased their seats in parliament, they were unable to become the biggest party and renew their premiership.\n\n\"But Finnish political culture is known for its flexibility. They are known for their ability to negotiate and form compromises.\"", "An armed man wearing a devil mask was stopped from entering a strip club in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday.\n\nCCTV shows security guards fighting off and disarming the man, who was carrying a loaded gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other, according to police.\n\nTampa Police Department Interim Chief Lee Bercaw said there was \"no question in my mind\" the security guards had prevented a mass shooting.\n\nOfficers, who took the man into custody, said they found two additional full magazines in his pocket and more ammunition, knives and firearm holsters in his truck.", "There is \"no drama\" over whether the public swear allegiance to the King during his Coronation, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said.\n\nGuests watching the service will be invited to join \"a chorus of millions\" to swear allegiance in the service led by Justin Welby.\n\nThe \"homage of the people\", revealed on Saturday by Lambeth Palace, is a new addition to the ancient ceremony.\n\nBut campaign group Republic called it \"nonsense\" and \"offensive\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC News, the archbishop reiterated the oath was \"an invitation; it's not a command\".\n\nThe King held an audience with the Archbishop of Canterbury ahead of Saturday's Coronation\n\n\"In every Anglican service, every Christian service, it is normal for congregations to participate,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an invitation - so if you want to join in at this point, by all means do so.\n\n\"If you don't want to, that's fine.

He said he has directed US military and intelligence to secure and limit distribution of any more sensitive information.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Its members would often discuss geopolitical affairs and wars.\n\nThe affidavit provided by FBI Special Agent Patrick Lueckenhoff to the court stated that the suspect began posting the leaked documents some time in December.\n\nThe initial leaks were in the form of paragraphs of text, according to the affidavit, but Mr Teixeira then moved on to posting photographs of documents in January.\n\nIt was not until intelligence material was posted outside the chat room group that Pentagon officials became aware of the leak, prompting a search for the culprit.\n\nMr Teixeira worked as an IT specialist in the intelligence wing of the Massachusetts National Guard, based at Otis Air National Guard Base in western Cape Cod.\n\nThe National Guard is a reservist wing of the US Air Force. They are not employed full-time in the military, but can be deployed when necessary.\n\nMr Teixeira's official title was cyber defence operations journeyman, according to the criminal complaint filed in the Boston court. He held the rank of Airman 1st Class - a relatively junior position.\n\nThe affidavit stated that Mr Teixeira held a \"top secret\" security clearance since 2021, and that he would have \"signed a lifetime binding non-disclosure agreement\" to take on his role.\n\nMr Luekenoff added the suspect \"would have had to acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure of protected information could result in criminal charges\".\n\nThe affidavit also alleged that Mr Teixeira used his government computer to search classified intelligence reporting for the word \"leak\" on 6 April - the day when public reporting about the documents first emerged.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Mr Teixeira searched the term to learn whether US intelligence had information on the identity of the person behind the leaks.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Congressman Hines: 'It was the lowest of low-tech leaks'", "Heather Armstrong, who found success in the 2000s documenting the ups and downs of motherhood on her blogging website Dooce, has died at the age of 47.\n\nHer boyfriend Pete Ashdown told the Associated Press (AP) he had found her on Tuesday night in their Utah home.\n\nThe \"queen of mommy blogging\" wrote frequently about her children, relationships and personal struggles.\n\nAt the height of its popularity, her Dooce website received more than eight million visitors a month, reports Vox.\n\nThat was in 2009 - the same year Ms Armstrong was named in Forbes' annual list of the 30 most influential women in media.\n\nMs Armstrong founded Dooce in the early 2000s as a place to discuss work, sex and leaving the Mormon church.\n\nThe site's name came from an inside joke about how she was unable to spell out the word \"dude\" quickly in online chats, according to the AP and New York Times.\n\nIn 2002, Ms Armstrong was fired from her job as a web designer in Los Angeles after the blog - in which she gave colleagues nicknames like That One Co-worker Who Manages to Say Something Stupid Every Time He Opens His Mouth - was found to be hers.\n\nHer firing, and the reason for it, ignited a public debate about privacy - and boosted traffic to her blog.\n\nThe site restarted six months later as a different kind of blog after she became pregnant. Embracing honesty in her writing, Ms Armstrong detailed her children's temper tantrums, her mental health challenges, and her struggles with alcoholism and postpartum depression.\n\nAccording to an estimate quoted in the Wall Street Journal, by 2009, the blog may have generated $40,000 (\u00a332,000) a month in revenue from paid advertising.\n\nMs Armstrong turned her success into a strong social media presence and three books, including the 2009 memoir It Sucked and then I Cried: How I Had a Baby, a Breakdown and a Much Needed Margarita.\n\nAccording to the book, she suffered chronic depression throughout her life and it was not treated until she got to college.\n\nA caption on a Dooce Instagram page on Wednesday announcing her death said: \"Hold your loved ones close and love everyone else.\"\n\nMr Ashdown told the AP that his partner had been sober for more than 18 months but had recently had a relapse. He said she had taken her own life.\n\nMs Armstrong is survived by her ex-husband Jon; her children Leta, 19 and Marlo, 14; as well as Mr Ashdown and his three children from a previous marriage.", "Deputy PM Dominic Raab has paid his own legal fees during an investigation into allegations he bullied officials.\n\nMr Raab's spokesman said it was \"not an option\" for his legal representation to be paid by the government.\n\nThis is despite taxpayers footing the bill for Boris Johnson's lawyers in the Partygate inquiry, which so far runs to \u00a3220,000.\n\nDowning Street is facing questions about why Mr Johnson is getting government support.\n\nRishi Sunak's spokesman said the former prime minister was being investigated over government business when he was a minister.\n\nHe argued that this was different to Mr Raab's case and meant that Mr Johnson was entitled to government support under an \"established process\".\n\nThe PM's spokesman denied both men were being investigated over their behaviour and were therefore subject to the same rules.\n\nMr Johnson - whose legal team is headed by top barrister Lord Pannick KC - is facing claims he deliberately lied to Parliament over Covid-rule breaking in Downing Street when he was prime minister.\n\nThe Commons Privileges Committee is currently deciding whether he is guilty of a contempt of Parliament. Mr Johnson was last month grilled for nearly four hours by the committee, with a lawyer at his side.\n\nMr Raab is under investigation over eight formal complaints about his behaviour as foreign secretary, Brexit secretary and during his first stint as justice secretary.\n\nHe has denied allegations of bullying and said he has always \"behaved professionally\" - but has previously said he would resign if the inquiry finds against him.\n\nThe bullying probe is being carried out by lawyer Adam Tolley KC, who was appointed by Mr Sunak in November.\n\nMr Tolley's report is expected to land on the prime minister's desk shortly. He will then decide - based on the evidence in it - whether Mr Raab has broken the ministerial code and must be sacked.\n\nNews that Mr Raab had paid for his own legal advice was included in a much-delayed update to the register of ministerial interests, published by the government in the wake of controversy over Mr Sunak's financial transparency.\n\nMr Raab's entry in the register reads: \"The minister has engaged lawyers at his own expense in relation to the investigation being conducted by Adam Tolley KC.\"\n\nMinisters are meant to register shareholdings, directorships, investments or any other financial arrangement that could lead to a conflict of interest.\n\nIt is unusual for a minister to declare an expense on the register, as Mr Raab has done.\n\nA Cabinet Office source said ministers can also use the register to declare \"anything that is relevant to their work as a minister\".", "Steve Mackey with Jarvis Cocker at the premiere of Pulp, a documentary about the Sheffield indie band, in 2014\n\nPulp bassist Steve Mackey has died at the age of 56, his family has confirmed.\n\nThe Sheffield musician played on hits including Common People, Disco 2000 and Lipgloss, after joining Pulp in 1989.\n\nHis wife Katie posted a message to social media on Thursday, saying he had been in hospital for the past three months with an undisclosed illness.\n\n\"We are shocked and devastated to have said goodbye to my brilliant, beautiful husband,\" she added.\n\n\"Steve was the most talented man I knew, an exceptional musician, producer, photographer and filmmaker.\n\n\"As in life, he was adored by everyone whose paths he crossed in the multiple creative disciplines he conquered.\n\n\"I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the NHS staff who worked tirelessly for Steve.

As results emerged, it was clear that pre-election polls had underestimated the 20-point margin between the two main parties.\n\nMr Mitsotakis's party won 146 seats, five seats short of the 151 required for a majority. An interior ministry vote map showed all but one of Greece's electoral districts coloured in New Democracy blue.\n\nThe prime minister's remarks were taken as indication that he would not look to share power with another party but go for a second election in late June, when the winning party picks up bonus seats.\n\nGreek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou will offer him a mandate to form a coalition, which he is likely to refuse. She will then pass it to the next two parties, and if that fails she will arrange a caretaker government until new elections.\n\nThe result was an immense setback for Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, who described his party's performance as \"extremely negative\". He came to power in 2015 campaigning against the austerity of international bailouts, but ultimately agreed to creditors' demands.\n\nThe centre-right has governed Greece for the past four years, and can boast that the country's growth last year was close to 6%.\n\nMr Mitsotakis's pitch to the nation was that only he could be trusted to steer the Greek economy forward and consolidate recent growth. Greeks appear to have responded positively - more than expected.\n\nGiorgos Adamopoulos, 47, voted for New Democracy a few hundred metres from the Acropolis in Athens.\n\nGreece deserved a better form of politics, he told the BBC, but he backed Mr Mitsotakis because he was impressed with his record after four years as prime minister.\n\nI think that he has a plan. In all my years of voting, it was the first time that I saw someone where with 80% of what he said, he did it\n\nFour years ago winning 41% of the vote would have been enough to secure a majority in Greece's 300-seat parliament.\n\nNow it requires more than 45%, because the winning party is no longer entitled to a 50-seat bonus in the first round, making a re-run more likely.\n\nMr Mitsotakis will have his eye on the extra seats he would be entitled to if he won the second election. An outright majority would give him four years in power with a cabinet of his choice.\n\nIf he were to seek coalition talks, then Syriza's socialist rival Pasok would be a potential partner, as one of the election's big winners with 11.5% of the vote.\n\nBut that would prove tricky as Pasok leader Nikos Androulakis was the target of a wiretap scandal last year.\n\nIt led to the resignations of a nephew of Mr Mitsotakis, who was working as the prime minister's chief of staff, and also of the head of Greek intelligence.\n\nMr Androulakis believes the prime minister was aware he was one of the dozens of people targeted with illegal spyware.\n\nMr Mitsotakis comes from one of Greece's most powerful political dynasties.\n\nHis father Konstantinos Mitsotakis was himself prime minister in the early 1990s; his sister Dora Bakoyannis was foreign minister and her son Kostas Bakoyannis is the current mayor of Athens.\n\nIn the end a rail tragedy in February that overshadowed the election campaign played no obvious role in the result.\n\nFifty-seven people died in the disaster, many of them students. Opposition parties highlighted the tragedy as a symptom of a dysfunctional state pared down to the bone after years of economic crisis and under-investment.\n\nGreeks have the right to vote from the age of 17, and an initial analysis of voting by Greek TV suggested that 31.5% of voters aged 17-24 backed ND, almost three points higher than Syriza.\n\nFirst-time voters Chrysanthi and Vaggelis, both 18, voted for Syriza because their generation wanted \"something new, something different\".\n\nI think everyone deserves a second chance. [Tsipras] only had four years\n\nOther than Pasok, the communist KKE party also increased their share of the vote.\n\nBut another casualty was former Syriza finance minister Yannis Varoufakis, whose MeRA25 party failed to qualify for parliament.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: Police accountability must not take place \"behind closed doors\" says Baroness Lawrence\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has failed to change in the 30 years since the murder of her teenage son, Baroness Doreen Lawrence has told BBC News.\n\nWeeks after a landmark report found evidence of continuing systemic racism, Baroness Lawrence said officers can be \"as brutal as they want\" without being held to account.\n\nShe told the BBC the findings of the Casey Review did not surprise her.\n\nBlack people are never seen as \"people that should have justice\", she added.\n\nIt is now 30 years since the murder of Stephen, and Baroness Lawrence sat down with me ahead of a memorial service for her son. She told me she had spoken to the Met's Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and told him promises of change must be judged against the experience of the public.\n\nEighteen-year-old Stephen was killed in 1993 in an unprovoked racist attack by a gang at a bus stop in Eltham in south-east London. Two of his five suspected killers were jailed for murder nearly 20 years later.\n\nThe 1999 Macpherson Report into the failed investigation into Stephen's death found there had been \"institutional racism\" in the Metropolitan Police. The watershed report made 70 recommendations, many aimed at improving police attitudes to racism.\n\nTwenty-four years on, Baroness Louise Casey's recent report once again found the force to be an institutionally racist organisation - as well as homophobic and misogynistic.\n\n\"I don't know how many more inquiries and how many reviews you need to have to say the same thing - and still no changes, and still denials,\" Baroness Lawrence says.\n\n\"Officers [are] able to be as brutal as they want, and nobody holds them to account.\"\n\nBaroness Lawrence told me she did not believe she would ever see full justice for her son's murder. She says that without the family's constant pressure, even those two convictions in 2012 would not have happened.\n\n\"Within the black community, how we're treated, how crime's investigated, we're never seen as a group of people that should have justice,\" she says. \"So everything that we've had, we've had to fight for - and continue to fight.\"\n\nI have covered the Lawrence story since the 1990s and have watched and interviewed Doreen many times as she campaigned for justice for her son. The private person we will never know, but her public persona has changed considerably. Back then, she treated her encounters with the media as a necessary evil, her only means of keeping her family's cruel denial of justice in the public eye.\n\nDay after day, during the Macpherson Inquiry hearings into the botched murder investigation, I would watch from the media pen as Doreen braced herself to run the gauntlet of the cameras waiting to catch her as she arrived. Her face was taut with the strain of daily exposure, and of having to relive, through the evidence, the tragedy that had befallen her - all in the full glare of publicity.\n\nA private, guarded person, Doreen Lawrence was the most reluctant of figureheads, a bereaved mother who wore her grief heavily like armour, and who endured the spotlight only in the fervent hope of seeing her son's killers convicted - and the police exposed for their failings.\n\nThirty years later, Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon has lost none of her steel. But she is a more relaxed person, more comfortable in her public role, and with an easy warmth. There is no rest for her though, and perhaps there never will be.\n\nThe bus stop in Eltham, London, where Stephen Lawrence was attacked\n\nDespite the 2012 convictions of David Norris and Gary Dobson, there are other suspects who are still free.\n\nThen, there has been the fallout - Baroness Lawrence discovered that police officers were spying on her and her family - and right now, she is involved in a legal case against the publisher of the Daily Mail, alleging it was illicitly gathering information about her.\n\nShe says that as long as the police continue to deny they did anything wrong, there will be no change. \"The reality is that they didn't do everything that they could - they allowed the perpetrators to go free.\"\n\nSir Mark Rowley, the Commissioner of the Met, has admitted that there are severe shortcomings, but that the Met is not the same force that it was 20 or 25 years ago.\n\n\"I think the public should be the judge of that and not him,\" Baroness Lawrence says.\n\nShe adds that she has heard \"a lot of rhetoric\" from the commissioner, \"but unless we see the changes ourselves, we're never going to believe that\".\n\nWhen she met Sir Mark after the publication of the Casey report, she told him the public needed to see improvements for themselves.\n\n\"But over the past - in Stephen's case - 30 years, nothing much has changed,\" she says.\n\nWill she ever stop campaigning? \"You need to use your voice,\" she replies. But the burden of it remains. \"I don't want to be constantly in the public eye\u2026 at the end of the day, I just want to be, just me and my family.\"\n\nShe feels that 30 years ago, society was not sufficiently shocked by Stephen's murder, and that although the Black Lives Matter movement has since \"opened people's eyes up a little bit more\", it has not led to permanent change.\n\nShe says she tries not to feel bitter, because that would affect her personally, but admits she feels \"disappointed, upset, and at times I can be quite angry\".\n\nIn 2018, Stephen's father, Neville Lawrence, said he had forgiven their son's killers as a way of helping him cope.\n\nBaroness Lawrence feels that for her to do so, they would first need to admit to their crime. \"But they've never owned up, and in their eyes, they've done nothing wrong.\"\n\nMr Lawrence has since said that their son's killers should confess before being considered for parole.\n\nBaroness Lawrence continues to campaign for justice and racial equality and has set up the Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation to help young people achieve their ambitions.\n\nIn 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa May announced a national day of commemoration would take place on 22 April - the day of Stephen's murder - every year.\n\nThe 30th anniversary will be marked by a private church service, as well as community events involving local schools, the Prince's Trust and the police cadets.\n\nPrivately, Baroness Lawrence will remember her son by laying flowers at the bus stop where he lost his life, as she does every year.\n\nThirty years after the murder of her son, Baroness Lawrence says police are still in denial.", "The event at City Hall for D\u00e1ith\u00ed Mac Gabhann featured circus performers and superheroes\n\nA six-year-old boy who successfully campaigned to change Northern Ireland's organ donation laws has become the youngest ever person to be awarded the freedom of Belfast.\n\nD\u00e1ith\u00ed Mac Gabhann, who needs a heart transplant, was given the accolade at City Hall on Saturday.\n\nThe ceremony took place just days after D\u00e1ith\u00ed's Law came into effect.\n\nIt means most adults will be considered potential organ donors unless they opt-out or are in an excluded group.\n\nThe bill, which brings Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK, was delayed due to political stalemate at Stormont, but was later passed by MPs at Westminster in February.\n\nThe intent of the Organ and Tissue Donation (Deemed Consent) legislation is to increase the number of organs available to people in need of a transplant.\n\nThe special event at City Hall, which featured circus performers and superheroes, was designed around D\u00e1ith\u00ed passions.\n\nSpeaking before the ceremony D\u00e1ith\u00ed's father, M\u00e1irt\u00edn, said he was full of pride for his son.\n\nD\u00e1ith\u00ed's father M\u00e1irt\u00edn Mac Gabhann said nobody deserved the accolade more\n\n\"Our D\u00e1ith\u00ed, he woke up this morning and we just heard from his room him singing: 'Freedom freedom freedom!'\n\n\"It's hard to put into words exactly how I feel but proud - beyond proud - and I'm sure that nobody deserves it more than our D\u00e1ith\u00ed for everything he's done for our society.\"\n\nIn a speech, Mr Mac Gabhann described his son as a symbol of hope, resilience and people power.\n\n\"To say that we proud of D\u00e1ith\u00ed would be an understatement,\" he told attendees at City Hall.\n\n\"His courage, resilience, and unwavering determination have shone brightly through the darkest of times.\n\n\"D\u00e1ith\u00ed's journey has been one of immense challenges, but he has faced them with a spirit that inspires us all.\"\n\nMr Mac Gabhann paid tribute to medical professionals, organ donors and their families who made the \"ultimate selfless act\" of giving life to others.\n\n\"May this recognition serve as a reminder to us all that the greatest power lies within us - the power to transform lives, to inspire change, and to create a world filled with compassion and love.\"\n\nThe sun was shining down on the massive circus tent set up in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in honour of six-year-old D\u00e1ith\u00ed.\n\nCircus performers entertained guests before the arrival of the little boy who has met the prime minister and changed the law.\n\nD\u00e1ith\u00ed meets other superheroes at the freedom of the city event on Saturday\n\nA huge round of applause rang out as D\u00e1ith\u00ed was wheeled into the tent by his father M\u00e1irt\u00edn, and spirits were high throughout the show which featured comedy, magic and, of course, a special presentation to D\u00e1ith\u00ed with his own key to the city.\n\nEverywhere I looked people were smiling, celebrating a young boy who has hopefully made life better for himself and countless others.\n\nLord Mayor of Belfast Tina Black said all councillors had backed the motion to give D\u00e1ith\u00ed the award, adding that it was an honour to host the event.\n\n\"He's going to be the youngest recipient ever, he's super excited, it's totally themed around his likes,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"The day is all about him and all the other brave children who are awaiting transplants, so it truly is a glorious day for our city.\"\n\nBelfast's Lord Mayor Tina Black welcomed D\u00e1ith\u00ed and his family to the special event on Saturday\n\nThe mayor described the Mac Gabhann family as \"unceasingly brave\" and said the six-year-old had \"moved mountains\".\n\n\"He's actually getting a key today for the city but I really do think he has the key to all our hearts anyway -

In addition, they have committed to working with us on tackling workload.\"\n\nThe Welsh government welcomed the decision to pause strikes.\n\n\"This is good news for pupils, parents and the teaching profession,\" a spokesperson said. \"Taken alongside the progress we have made in bringing together a package of measures to reduce workload, we believe this is a good pay offer that we hope members can support.\"\n\nAll schools in Wales were affected by strike action on 2 March, postponed from 14 Feb.\n\nThe strike originally planned in Wales for 14 February was postponed so the NEU could consult members on an improved pay offer from the Welsh government, which was later rejected.\n\nMembers of the NAHT, which represents head teachers, are currently taking industrial action short of a strike, while teachers' union the NASUWT had rejected the offer and was due to ballot members.\n\nNAHT Cymru leader, Laura Doel, said: \"This is a positive move but we still have concerns about some elements about the funding of the offer.\"\n\nNASUWT general secretary, Patrick Roach, said: \"The minister's offer to deliver an award to teachers on a without prejudice basis before the end of the financial year should mean that teachers will benefit from additional money today rather than empty promises of jam tomorrow.\"", "The stolen gold coins were discovered near Manching in 1999, and are thought to date back to the first century BC\n\nFour people have been arrested in Germany over the theft of a hoard of Celtic gold coins worth about \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.4m).\n\nHundreds of coins were taken from a museum in Manching, Bavaria, during a night raid in November.\n\nMany of them dated from around the 1st Century BC.\n\nThe authorities say there is \"overwhelming evidence\" in the case and that investigations are continuing. More details are expected on Thursday.\n\nThat includes whether part of the horde of coins has been recovered.\n\nThe arrests were made on Tuesday during a search operation in the northern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\nBavaria's interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said the suspects were \"professional burglars\".\n\n\"The mission continues,\" Ch Insp Ludwig Waldinger from the Bavarian police told the Bild newspaper.\n\n\"We are searching properties in several federal states.\"\n\nThe coins were unearthed during a 1999 archaeological dig near Manching - considered to be the biggest discovery of Celtic gold in the 20th Century. They had been on display since 2006.\n\nPolice at the time of their theft suspected that those involved sabotaged the museum's alarm system. Just before the break-in, nearby internet cables were cut, causing widespread outages.\n\nThis meant the alarm system was not triggered when a door was pried open, although it was able to record when the robbery, which lasted less than 10 minutes, took place.\n\nThe authorities had been exploring whether the theft involved organised crime and was linked to previous raids.\n\nIn 2017, a hefty gold coin weighing 100kg was snatched from a Berlin museum. Two years later, thieves took 21 pieces of jewellery and other valuables in a dramatic diamond heist at Dresden's Green Vault museum that was caught on CCTV.\n\nThe loss of the coins devastated the museum and the wider community.\n\nRupert Gebhard, head of collections at the State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said it felt \"like losing an old friend\".", "So what happens next?

The most painful loss of my career,\" said Jabeur, who had been aiming to be the first African or Arab woman to win a Grand Slam singles title.\n\u2022 None New tattoo for Vondrousova after etching name into history\n\u2022 None 'My most painful loss' - tears flow again on Centre\n\nVondrousova becomes 'most unlikely' Wimbledon champion\n\nVondrousova reached the French Open final as a teenager in 2019, where she lost to Australia's Ashleigh Barty, before seeing her progress hampered by two wrist surgeries.\n\nClay courts have long been considered the Czech's best surface and she admitted before her semi-final she \"never thought\" she could do well on grass.\n\nBut her game style - using a top-spin forehand to good effect, the ability to play with variety and regularly able to keep the ball in play - has translated to the grass courts.\n\nVondrousova came into Wimbledon having won only four grass-court matches in her career.\n\nEven after winning under the Centre Court roof - which was closed because of winds predicted to reach speeds of 50mph - still owns an 11-11 win-loss record on the surface.\n\nIt led American former world number one Tracy Austin - who was working on BBC Sport's television coverage of the final - saying Vondrousova was the \"most unlikely\" champion.\n\nNerves get better of Jabeur\n\nHistory was at stake for both players, but particularly for Jabeur, who has become a trailblazer for African and Arab women.\n\nBut the Tunisian, who was the pre-match favourite, looked overwhelmed by the weight of expectation.\n\nWhile both players managed beaming smiles for the camera as they posed for the traditional pre-match photograph, the nerves associated with playing in a Wimbledon final quickly became apparent.\n\nJabeur seemed more stressed than her opponent in a tense opening set, even after she took an early break to lead 2-0.\n\nShe stayed rooted to the baseline as she looked to find rhythm, rarely employing her favoured drop-shot and was broken straight back for 2-1.\n\nThree successive breaks of serve - in favour of Vondrousova - were indicative of the tension that remained on both sides of the net, but particularly for Jabeur, who saw a 4-2 advantage disappear.\n\nJabeur, who has an effervescent and engaging personality, is known as the 'Minister of Happiness' back home and usually plays with a smile on her face.\n\nBut her body language became increasingly negative, head bowed and shoulders slumping, clearly unable to compute what was happening.\n\nAfter Vondrousova served out for a one-set lead, Jabeur took a short break in the locker room. When she emerged, she lost serve again before finally growing in confidence and playing more freely to move 3-1 ahead.\n\nHowever, uncertainty quickly reappeared. Vondrousova broke back in the fifth game of a match which continued to provide twists and turns.\n\nJabeur, who lost to Elena Rybakina in last year's final after winning the first set, has become a crowd favourite at the All England Club in recent years.\n\nEncouraging shouts of support came her way after she lost serve again for 5-4 and, despite briefly wobbling with a double fault on her first match point, Vondrousova sealed a famous win.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough day but I'm not going to give up.

Watch: The moments leading up to St Petersburg cafe explosion\n\nImages showed the box being placed on a table in the cafe before the woman sat down. Another video showed a statue being handed to Tatarsky.\n\nIn a brief excerpt of her interrogation released by the Russian authorities, Darya Trepova appeared under duress as she sighed repeatedly.\n\nWhen her interrogator asked if she knew why she was detained, she replied: \"I would say for being at the scene of Vladlen Tatarsky's murder... I brought the statuette there which blew up.\"\n\nAsked who gave it to her she responded: \"Can I tell you later please?\"\n\nRussia's anti-terrorism committee alleged the \"terror attack\" was organised by Ukrainian special services \"with people co-operating with\" opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe investigative committee later went further, saying it had evidence it was \"planned and organised from Ukrainian territory\". It was working to establish the \"entire chain\" of people involved, it added.\n\nNavalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has released a series of expos\u00e9s of corruption involving the Putin entourage, said it was \"very convenient\" for the Kremlin to blame its critics when Navalny was due to go on trial soon for extremism.\n\nNavalny has been in jail ever since he returned to Russia from Germany in January 2021. He survived a nerve agent attack in Russia in August 2020, which was blamed on Russian FSB security service agents.\n\nFoundation head Ivan Zhdanov said everything pointed to FSB agents themselves. \"Naturally we have nothing to do with this,\" he said, adding that Russia needed an external enemy in the form of Ukraine and a domestic one in Navalny's team.\n\nMs Trepova was detained in a St Petersburg flat owned by a friend of her husband's, Russian reports said.\n\nOn the day of Russia's full-scale invasion last year she was reportedly detained for a number of days for taking part in an anti-war protest.\n\nThe cafe, Street Food Bar No 1 near the River Neva, was once owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin - who runs Russia's notorious Wagner mercenary group which has taken part in much of the fighting in Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.\n\nPrigozhin said he had handed it over to Cyber Front Z, a group that calls itself \"Russia's information troops\" and said it had hired out the cafe for the evening.\n\nPrigozhin paid tribute to Tatarsky in a late-night video which he declared was filmed from the town hall in Bakhmut.\n\nHe displayed a flag which he said had the words \"in good memory of Vladlen Tatarsky\".\n\nOn Monday, Tatarsky was awarded the posthumous Order of Courage by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTatarsky, a vocal supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine, was neither a Russian official nor a military officer. He was a well-known blogger with more than half a million followers and, like Prigozhin, had a criminal past.\n\nBorn in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, he said he joined Russian-backed separatists when they released him from jail, where he was serving time for armed robbery.\n\nHe was part of a pro-Kremlin military blogger community that has taken on a relatively high-profile role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.\n\nTatarsky is among those who have gone so far as to criticise the Russian authorities, slamming the military and even Mr Putin for setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nUnusually, Tatarsky took up arms in combat operations and reported from the front line. He claimed to have helped launch combat drones and build fortifications.\n\nLast September, he posted a video inside the Kremlin where Mr Putin was proclaiming the annexation of four part-occupied Ukrainian regions.\n\n\"We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone as necessary. Just as we like it,\" Tatarsky told his followers.\n\nThe military bloggers have provided information about the war in a country where many have become frustrated with the lack of accurate information from official sources.\n\nInformation provided by the Russian military, Kremlin-controlled television and state officials has been criticised for being inaccurate.\n\nLast week, several official Russian sources shared a video allegedly showing Ukrainian troops harassing civilians. Western analysts proved using open-source information that the video had been staged.\n\nSome pro-Kremlin bloggers also slammed the video as a crude fake. Much of the bloggers' pro-Russian material is not factual either.\n\nWho was behind Tatarsky's murder is unclear, but it is reminiscent of the killing of Darya Dugina, a vocal supporter of the war and the daughter of a Russian ultra-nationalist. She died in a car bomb attack near Moscow last August.\n\nWhile Russian officials pinned the blame firmly on Ukraine, in Kyiv presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the blast was part of a Russian \"internal political fight\", tweeting: \"Spiders are eating each other in a jar.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians have proved themselves as more than capable of carrying out drone attacks and explosions deep inside Russian territory in recent months. They rarely admit involvement but often drop hints.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin said he did not think it was the Ukrainian government: \"I think there is a group of radicals operating, which unlikely has something to do with the government.\"\n\nThe blast could be linked to Russian political infighting. There are now a lot of angry men carrying guns in Russia.\n\nWith the military running low on troops, convicts have been let out of prison, handed weapons and sent to the front. Russian authorities have also conducted large-scale recruitment campaigns for volunteer fighters and recruited some 300,000 men in a \"partial mobilisation\".\n\nThe Kommersant newspaper recently reported that the number of murders committed in Russia last year rose for the first time in 20 years.", "Colin Pitchfork was jailed for life for raping and strangling two 15-year-old girls, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth\n\nThe Lord Chancellor has asked the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to allow child killer Colin Pitchfork to be released from prison.\n\nPitchfork was jailed for life for raping and strangling two teenage girls in Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986.\n\nLord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said it was \"absolutely vital\" dangerous offenders were kept behind bars.\n\nHe said there was an arguable case the board's decision was irrational.\n\nPitchfork became the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence.\n\nHe was jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 1988 for the murder of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.\n\nThis was later reduced to 28 years for good behaviour.\n\nDawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann were raped and murdered by Pitchfork\n\nThe 63-year-old was released from prison in 2021 but was arrested and sent back to prison two months later.\n\nHe was granted parole in June following a hearing held in private in April.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr Chalk said: \"My thoughts remain with the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, whose lives were changed forever by the heinous crimes of Colin Pitchfork.\n\n\"My number one priority is public protection and after careful assessment I have asked the Parole Board to reconsider their decision to release him.\n\n\"It is absolutely vital that every lawful step is taken to keep dangerous offenders behind bars.\"\n\nThe Lord Chancellor is a senior member of the cabinet and heads the Ministry of Justice.\n\nHis intervention comes after the Conservative MP for South Leicestershire Alberto Costa called for the parole decision to be challenged.\n\nMr Costa said: \"I am very grateful to the justice secretary for listening to me and my constituents by challenging the Parole Board's deeply disappointing decision.\n\n\"Like many, I was aghast at the recent decision.\n\n\"The Parole Board now has a further opportunity to get this decision right and to ensure that Colin Pitchfork stays in prison where he belongs\".\n\nAfter the decision was made public last month, a Parole Board spokesperson said: \"Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care.

'I'll have a burger then it's back to training' - Matt Richards\n\nThe trio, who won gold together in the 4x200m freestyle relay at the Tokyo Olympics, have battled each other in events all week but this race was always expected to be the championship's grand finale. Seven of the eight men in the final were former Olympians with Scott, 26, the Olympic silver medallist when Dean won gold in Tokyo. Richards, 21, won gold in the event at last year's World Championships and Dean, 23, silver but it is the latter who missed out on qualification. Dean, who had set himself a bold target of five medals in Paris, had already effectively qualified for the 200m individual medley on Thursday by taking silver but also missed out on the place for the 100m freestyle event. \"I knew it was going to take a momentous effort,\" Dean said. \"It is fine margins and you can pay for it at the front end. \"I have been top three in the world for three years in a row and it shows the calibre of this competition. This is what you've got to do to just get on the team \"I have spoken about my big medal aims in Paris. That is still there. I want to win individual medals, relay medals and do as much as I can for the team. I have got to reset and slightly refocus.\" Richards said: \"I said to him at the end of the race it is so bittersweet because in a perfect world we would love it if we could all get in there and race. \"There is always going to be someone who just misses out and Deano is a phenomenal talent.\" James Guy finished fourth meaning he will travel to Paris for the relay as the same quartet - Guy, Dean, Scott and Richards - will look to defend the title they won in Tokyo.\n\nElsewhere on the final night of the championships, 12-year-old Iona Winnifrith shared the women's para 100m breaststroke title with Brock Whiston to put herself in line for Paralympic qualification. The pair, plus four others in the race - Maisie Summers-Newton, Rebecca Redfern, Grace Harvey, Louise Fiddes - made the nomination time for Paris with the Paralympic team to be confirmed in the coming months. Will Ellard equalled the S14 200m freestyle world record for his third title of the week, beating his fourth Paris nomination time in the process. Fourteen-year-old Amelie Blocksidge won the women's 800m freestyle title but missed out on the time needed for the Olympics. Anna Hopkin will race the 100m freestyle in Paris after she completed the sprint double by following up her win in the 50m event. Freya Anderson, on her return from glandular fever, was third and requires a coaches' pick to make the team. Oliver Morgan also won his second title of the week, backing up his 100m backstroke with an impressive finish to win the 200m event. He beat the qualification time, as did Luke Greenbank in second, meaning the pair will likely compete again in Paris. Tully Kearney won her second title of the meet, clinching the para 100m freestyle crown under the time needed for Paris while Angharad Evans won the 100m breaststroke but was outside of the Olympic time.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "The population of Whitecross might be small but community groups are at the heart of the village\n\nThe effect of the Covid-19 pandemic has \"hit a reset button\" for people tackling rural isolation, according to community volunteers in south Armagh.\n\nIn the rural village of Whitecross, one resident said periods of lockdown generated an appreciation of isolation.\n\nSharon Doran said the pandemic had brought rural isolation more to the fore and people now \"really understood what it meant\".\n\n\"It's nearly like we hit the reset button and started again,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a want and there's a real desire to see things up and running.\n\nElaine Cunningham says that in recent months the Whitecross community has become more open to social gatherings\n\n\"In the winter nights it's very easy to stay in but if there's football on, if there's exercise classes on, you've something to get you out.\"\n\nTerry O'Hanlon, chair of St Killian's Gaelic Athletic Club, said there had been a new-found appreciation for social interaction.\n\n\"We didn't value what we had until it was taken away.\n\n\"We were all sitting in our houses every evening and thought: 'There's bound to be more to life than this.'\n\n\"We are in an isolated rural area on the edge of the council boundaries.\n\nEileen McCann says rising costs are making it more difficult to host community events\n\n\"For people to start coming home in the evenings and get their kids to go back into Newry or back into an urban area it's a struggle to keep that going, whereas we're keeping everything here local.\"\n\nThe village now has regular \"clubercise\" classes for those who fancy a dancing workout with disco lights, and a new over-50s group to improve the wellbeing of the community.\n\nBut Mr O'Hanlon said there was still work to be done to encourage more men and elderly people back into social interaction in the village following the pandemic.\n\nSharon Doran is secretary of the Over-50s club and member of the Whitecross Community Association and says the residents \"love coming for the craic\".\n\n\"We would get someone in to do pilates, or dance classes but it's the craic people are lacking in - they want to speak to people,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\nSharon Doran says \"the craic\" is what people in Whitecross are seeking\n\nElaine Cunningham, a fitness instructor, said it was only since January this year that people had finally felt confident to move from online classes to face-to-face sessions.\n\nIn recent months there has been another strain on the efforts to tackle rural isolation in the village, the cost of living.\n\nEileen McCann, club secretary at St Killian's, said it had to charge more for use of the hall because of rising costs.\n\n\"One exercise class stopped running because it wasn't financially viable.\"", "Jill Barclay's body was discovered in Aberdeen last year\n\nA man has been jailed for at least 24 years for the rape and murder of a woman as she walked home in Aberdeen.\n\nMother-of-two Jill Barclay, 47, was attacked and burned alive.

Just two weeks ago, the bloc's chairman, President Bola Tinubu, warned that terrorism and the emerging pattern of coups in West Africa had reached alarming levels and demanded urgent, concerted actions.\n\nThis is the fifth coup in Niger since it gained independence from France in 1960, on top of other unsuccessful takeover attempts.", "The \"Robodebt\" policy vilified recipients of welfare, an inquiry has found\n\nA landmark inquiry in Australia has found an illegal welfare hunt by the previous government made victims feel like criminals and caused suicides.\n\nKnown locally as \"Robodebt\", it was an automated government scheme which incorrectly demanded welfare recipients pay back benefits.\n\nPeople received letters saying they owed thousands of dollars in debt, based off an incorrect algorithm.\n\nMore than half a million Australians were affected by the policy.\n\nThe scheme ran from 2016 until it was ruled illegal by a court in 2019. It had forced some of the country's poorest people to pay off false debts.\n\nMany were forced into worse financial circumstances - taking out loans, selling their cars or using savings to pay off a debt they were told they had to pay within weeks. Others described being vilified and feeling shame after being told they owed money.\n\nOn Friday, a royal commission inquiry into the scandal issued its final report, describing the scheme as a \"costly failure of public administration\" with \"extensive, devastating, and continuing\" ill-effects.\n\n\"Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals,\" Commissioner Catherine Holmes wrote in her 990-page report.\n\nA royal commission is Australia's most powerful form of public inquiry. This one ran for 11 months and drew hundreds of public submissions.\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the previous government's scheme as a \"gross betrayal\" of citizens, which had harmed the most vulnerable.\n\nThe inquiry found there were at least three known suicides as a result of Robodebt policy, and it was \"confident that these were not the only tragedies of the kind\".\n\nThe deaths by suicide included two young men Rhys Cauzzo, 28, and Jarrad Madgwick, 22, whose mothers gave testimony to the commission last year on their behalf. Kath Madgwick had previously told the BBC she holds the government partly responsible for Jarrad's suicide.\n\nJarrad Madgwick took his life after receiving a government debt notice\n\nOther victims told the inquiry how the stress of a debt demand had caused them anxiety and depression and led them to consider suicide.\n\nOne woman said she felt suicidal for a period of months with the debt hanging over her head, with the \"lowest point\" being the day the debt collector debited the money from her bank account.\n\n\"I felt desperate on that day; it was so upsetting that I could not afford to pay for my daughter's medical expenses and I felt powerless to improve my situation,\" she told the inquiry.\n\nAnother victim, who had experienced mental illness previously, said that upon receiving a $A11,000 (\u00a36,300, $8,100) debt notice, he was in \"complete shock\", because it would \"set me back years and years and years\".\n\nHe explained that \"from a generalised anxiety disorder point of view, it's just\u2026 the biggest trigger you can give to somebody\".\n\nThe inquiry's final report on Friday criticised former Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government for launching the scheme where \"little to no regard was had to the individuals and vulnerable cohorts that it would affect\".\n\nThe report also condemned Mr Morrison - who had been minister of the social services department at the time the policy was launched - for \"misleading\" Cabinet over advice that the switch to an automated system would not require legislative passage.\n\nIn response on Friday, Mr Morrison said he rejected \"each of the findings which are critical of my involvement in authorising the scheme and are adverse to me\".\n\nHe maintained he had \"acted in good faith and on clear and deliberate department advice\".\n\nThe report also accused the government of persisting with a cover-up of the scheme even when its \"unfairness, probable illegality and cruelty became apparent\" in 2017.\n\n\"It should then have been abandoned or revised drastically, and an enormous amount of hardship and misery... would have been averted,\" it said.\n\n\"Instead the path taken was to double down, to go on the attack in the media against those who complained and to maintain the falsehood that in fact the system had not changed at all.\"\n\nCommissioner Holmes also described a politicisation of welfare policy that had exacerbated a stigma often felt by recipients of social welfare.\n\nThe government also falsely exaggerated incidents of welfare fraud which were \"miniscule\" or less than 0.1% of cases, the report found.\n\nIn a sealed section of the report, the commissioner also recommended that a number of unidentified individuals involved in the policy be referred to criminal and civil prosecution.\n\nThe Morrison government abruptly ended the Robodebt scheme in 2019 after victims contested the legal basis in the Federal Court of Australia, where it was found to be illegal.\n\nIn its backdown, the government was also forced to refund over A$700m of payments to victims. It also settled a multimillion-dollar lawsuit brought by victims seeking compensation.\n\nIf you are feeling emotionally distressed and would like details of organisations in the UK which offer advice and support, go to bbc.co.uk/actionline.\n\nIf you are in Australia, you can call Lifeline at 131114, Kids Helpline at 1800 55 18000 or visit the Beyond Blue website.", "You have probably heard the saying \"mad as a March hare\".\n\nThis month the saying has rung especially true as the weather has been all over the place - to put it mildly.\n\nIt has always been a month of contrasts and by halfway into March we had warnings of ice, snow and heavy rain.\n\nThere has been significant snowfall in some areas - enough to build a whole snow family - and temperatures fell to -9C in Castlederg, County Tyrone.\n\nThat was on 8 March, making it the coldest March night since 2010.\n\nThen the rains came, with a warning of heavy downpours from the Met Office in the middle of the month.\n\nOver a 24-hour period, Derrylin in County Fermanagh recorded 35.4mm of rainfall, Killowen in County Down measured 29mm and Killylane, in the Glens of Antrim, recorded 26mm.\n\nThis was followed by a dramatic leap in temperature just ahead of St Patrick's Day.\n\nHelen's Bay recorded 16.1C on 16 March, making it the warmest day of the year so far and the highest temp in Northern Ireland since 13 November.\n\nJust more than seven days earlier was that icy -9C night in Castlederg - what a difference a week makes.\n\nIt is not unusual for the fair-skinned to get sunburn on St Patrick's Day as the mid-March sun is of a similar strength to September.\n\nThis year the spring equinox was the following day, 20 March, when the sun sits directly over the Earth's equator as it heads northward.\n\nBoth hemispheres share the sun's rays equally at the equinox, and night and day are roughly the same length.\n\nSpring is said to be a transitional season and wide variations in weather can occur, from wintry conditions in the first half of the season to warm, almost summer like conditions any time from late April onwards.\n\nThe sun is strengthening significantly, the oceans are slowly warming and the jet stream is usually further north, which influences where our air is coming from.\n\nAir coming in from a southerly direction will always be warmer.\n\nWith the fierce changes in weather, there is often some truth in a saying often used in reference to March: \"In like a lion, out like a lamb.\"\n\nIt is likely our recent snow, towards the beginning of the month, is down to SSW - or sudden stratospheric warming - which five years ago helped bring about the infamous Beast from the East.\n\nJohn Wylie, a former colleague who works with the Met Office in Northern Ireland, said that cold and wintery conditions, including significant snowfall, are not uncommon in March.\n\nIn 2010, 2013 and 2018, each March had highly disruptive snowfall events.\n\nNature has a habit of redressing the balance and the exceptional mildness of February (2.5C above average) has been countered by much colder conditions during the first half of March, with average temperatures around 2.5C below average.\n\nAt present, it is possible March could end up colder than February which, although unusual, is certainly not without precedent.\n\nThe latter part of this month has been quite mild, windy at times and wet - a wetter than average month right across Northern Ireland.\n\nUp to 23 March, Aldergrove will have had its fourth wettest March on record - with still a week of weather to go.\n\nThis weekend the clocks spring forward just as a northerly Arctic wind sets in to bring Sunday temperatures back down to single digits.\n\nSo after a roaring start to spring lets hope we skip through April like a newborn lamb with plenty of sunshine and not as many showers.\n\nThere were a couple of well-worn weather phrases in the article above, but what about some of the other sayings and pieces of traditional wisdom that we use to predict, describe or decry the weather?\n\nHere's a look at a few more.\n\nHow about \"too cold to snow\"? This is a saying backed up by science.\n\nThe colder it gets, the less water vapour it can hold, which reduces the likelihood of snow.\n\nBut there are many other factors to consider when it comes to whether or not it will snow and it's unlikely that across the island of Ireland we would experience temperatures low enough.\n\nSo true, but unlikely to happen here.\n\nAs pet owners and friends of four-legged creatures everywhere can attest, animals can often be predictors of thunderously stormy weather.\n\nCats and dogs are more sensitive than humans to sounds, smells and changes in atmospheric pressure.\n\nTheir heightened senses can allow them to pick up hints that a storm is coming well before their owners catch wind of it.\n\nJust before a storm, your cat's inner ears may detect the sudden fall in atmospheric pressure and it may have learned to associate this with an impending storm.\n\nIf a storm is already raging in the distance, it may be able to perceive the faint rumble of thunder.\n\nLikewise, your dog may be able to smell the incoming rain or the characteristic whiff of ozone gas, often created by lightning which has a sharp, metallic odour.\n\nAnd finally what about this old (sort of) chestnut.\n\n\"Pinecones open up when good weather is coming\" is another with a kernel of truth.\n\nIn dry weather, pinecones dry out, causing their scales to open out.\n\nIn damp conditions, they become more flexible and return to a more closed shape.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEnergy providers are warning Americans to be frugal with air-conditioning this weekend, as intense heat and increased demand could lead to blackouts.\n\nNearly 200 million Americans are under \"dangerously hot conditions\" alerts with temperatures expected to soar past 100F (38C) in several major cities.\n\nJuly is expected to be Earth's hottest month since record keeping began.\n\nPJM Interconnection, the company in charge of power supply in 13 states and Washington DC, warned that \"extreme heat and/or humidity may cause capacity problems on the grid\".\n\n\"Temperatures are expected to go above 90F (32\u00b0C) across the footprint, which drives up the demand for electricity,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn New York, where the heat index - how hot it feels - is expected to climb as high as 110F, energy provider Con Edison is telling residents to reduce energy usage at home to help avert shutoffs.\n\n\"Intense heat and increased demand for air conditioning can cause strain on the electric system and may lead to localised outages,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe city is keeping swimming pools open longer and pointing New Yorkers to dozens of cooling centres for those without air-conditioning.\n\nGrid operators across the country declared hot weather alerts this week and told energy companies to put off unnecessary maintenance so all available generating plants and power lines would be ready for service.\n\nAccording to the most recent results from the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, 88% of US households use air conditioning.\n\nIn New York, the heat index is expected to climb as high as 110F\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that the sweltering heat will \"engulf much of the eastern half of the US\".\n\nWeekend could bring the hottest days of summer so far for millions of people from coastal Virginia through Washington DC, where heat indexes are also expected to surpass 110F.\n\nMany places are set to surpass their temperature records for daytime highs as well as warm night time lows through Saturday morning, the NWS said.\n\nThe southern US has already been baking under sweltering heat this past month. On Thursday, the city of Phoenix, Arizona marked the most consecutive days per year - 15 - with temperatures above 115F.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.\n\nSome, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.\n\nSingling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills.\n\nMore than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit.\n\nBut the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.\n\nMost of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes.\n\nBut in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.\n\nSo while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.\n\nBut here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU.\n\nAnd official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.\n\nHowever, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.\n\nThe remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic.\n\nThe government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.\n\nBut meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros.\n\nEvery consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343.\n\nThe changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform.\n\nThat is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages.\n\nSuch employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers.\n\nThen there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum.\n\nEconomists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.\n\nBut with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time.\n\nThe current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope.", "Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor saw music as the therapy to escape a turbulent childhood.\n\nHer rebellious nature was mainly driven by resentment at the abuse she suffered as a child and her experience in a Dublin reformatory.\n\nIt was music that rescued her, unleashing a creative talent that made her a worldwide music star - but also a rebel prepared to be controversial and never play the game of being an image-led pop star.\n\nWith her elfin features and skinhead look she was one of pop music's most recognisable figures.\n\nSin\u00e9ad Marie Bernadette O'Connor was born on 8 December 1966 in the affluent Glenageary suburb of Dublin.\n\nShe was the third of five children of Sean O'Connor and his wife Marie. The couple had married young and their relationship, often stormy, ended when O'Connor was eight.\n\nHer brother, Joseph, once described their mother as deeply unhappy and disturbed and prone to physical and emotional abuse of her children.\n\nO'Connor eventually moved out to go and live with her father but she often played truant to go shoplifting.\n\nEventually she was placed in Dublin's An Grianan Training Centre, once one of the notorious Magdalene laundries, originally set up to incarcerate young girls deemed to be promiscuous.\n\nOne nun discovered that the only way to keep this rebellious teenager in check was by buying her a guitar and setting her up with a music teacher. It was to be the saving of her.\n\nThe success of her first album made her a huge concert draw\n\nA volunteer at the institution had a brother who played in the Irish band In Tua Nua. She did record a song with them but they felt she was too young to become a full-time member.\n\nAt 16 her father moved her to a boarding school in Waterford where a teacher recognised her talent and helped her produce a demo tape featuring two of her own compositions.\n\nA meeting with the producer and composer Colm Farrelly saw them come together with other musicians to form the band Ton Ton Macoute.\n\nThey made an immediate impact and, when they relocated to Dublin, O'Connor dropped out of school to go with them.\n\nHer second album won her a Grammy\n\nEventually she moved to London and found herself an experienced manager in Fachtna \u00d3 Ceallaigh, who had previously worked for U2.\n\nAs well as guiding her musically, \u00d3 Ceallaigh imbued her with his own brand of republican politics. She caused a stir when she praised the Provisional IRA, although she later apologised.\n\nEver the rebel, she firmly rejected attempts by her record company to change her punk look and become more girly.\n\n\"What they were describing,\" O'Connor later told the Daily Telegraph, \"was actually their mistresses. I pointed that out to them which they didn't take terribly well.\"\n\nShe also fell out with the producer who had been brought in to mastermind her first album. After much persuasion, the record company allowed her to produce it herself. By this time she was seven months pregnant by her session drummer, John Reynolds, whom she went on to marry.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor: In her own words\n\nThe Lion and the Cobra, released in 1987, was a storming success. It featured what would become the typical O'Connor sound, overdubbed harmonies and atmospheric backgrounds held together by her distinctive voice. It earned a Grammy nomination for best female rock vocal performance.\n\nOne single, Mandinka, did well in the US and was the song she chose to sing on Late Night with David Letterman, her first American primetime TV appearance.\n\nShe topped this with her follow-up album, the Grammy-winning I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, which featured her most successful single, a cover of the Prince song Nothing Compares 2 U.\n\nIt was helped to the top of the charts in the UK, Ireland and the US by a striking video that largely featured a close-up of her face as she sang.\n\nShe cried during the making of the video and later said she found it difficult to sing the song because it reminded her of the loss of her mother, who had died in a car accident in 1985.\n\nBut controversy was never far away. She refused to perform at a concert venue in New Jersey unless it dropped its normal practice of playing the US national anthem before she went on.\n\nThe venue reluctantly agreed but it led to a boycott of her songs by a number of US radio stations.\n\nA month after the release of I'm Not Your Girl, a collection of jazz standards, O'Connor performed a version of Bob Marley's War on NBC's Saturday Night Live, substituting some of the words so it became a protest against child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.\n\nTo the horror of the producers she held up a photo of Pope John Paul II to the camera and tore it in half. NBC received more than 4,000 complaints from viewers and many destroyed copies of her records.\n\nAt a subsequent live appearance she was booed so much she couldn't perform. At the end of 1992 she returned to live in Dublin.\n\nHer fourth album, Universal Mother, featuring writing contributions from Germaine Greer and Kurt Cobain, failed to emulate the success of her earlier work. It was to be her last studio album for six years.\n\nHaving split from her husband, she found herself locked in a long custody battle with the journalist John Waters, who had fathered her second child, a daughter named Roisin. The stress caused her to attempt suicide in 1999.\n\nIn one of the stranger turns of her life she was ordained a priest in the Latin Tridentine Church, an independent Catholic church, not in communion with Rome. Despite her disdain for the Church hierarchy, O'Connor always maintained she was a practising Christian and a devout Catholic.\n\nShe went back into the studio in 2000 to record the album Faith and Courage. Largely self-penned, it failed to break into the Top 20 in all but the Australian album charts.\n\nThere was a brief second marriage with the journalist Nick Sommerlad before she had a third child, Shane, with the musician Donal Lunny.\n\nShe surprised many by being ordained as a priest\n\nThe 2002 album Sean-Nos Nua featured a reworking of traditional Irish folk songs. A year later she released a compilation of previously unheard tracks and demos before announcing she was retiring from music.\n\nBoth her mental and physical health were suffering, Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she was also battling the painful condition of fibromyalgia.\n\nA spell in Jamaica resulted in her seventh studio album, Throw Down Your Arms, a collection of reggae-flavoured covers that met with positive reviews.\n\nShe gave birth to her fourth child, Yeshua Francis Bonadio in 2006, fathered by her then partner Frank Bonadio. The following year she released yet another album, Theology. It failed to ignite the charts.\n\nA third marriage in 2010 to long-time friend Steve Cooney lasted less than a year.\n\nShe came back to musical form with How About I Be Me (and You Be You) released in 2012, which reached number five in Ireland and 33 in the UK charts.\n\nThere was a very public spat with the singer Miley Cyrus in 2013 after O'Connor published a letter on her website, criticising Cyrus for her overtly sexual videos. Cyrus responded by describing O'Connor as \"crazy\".\n\nAt her best she was an artist of real talent\n\nO'Connor proved she could still deliver the goods with the release of her 2014 album I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss. She appeared on the cover wearing a wig and figure-hugging black dress while caressing a guitar.\n\nBut her mental health was still precarious. In November 2015, after recovering from a hysterectomy, she posted a message on Facebook announcing she was staying at a hotel and contemplating suicide. She was found safe and well and received medical treatment.\n\nConverting to Islam in 2018, she changed her name to Shuhada' Sadaqat, but continued to perform under her birth name.\n\nShe released a memoir, Rememberings, in June 2021 and took part in media interviews to promote it, some of them fraught. The singer said she felt \"badly triggered\" by an interview on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour about her mental health struggles and the media's coverage of it.\n\nMore trauma came in January 2022, when her 17-year-old son Shane took his own life. The musician posted a series of concerning tweets in the wake of his death, indicating she was considering suicide and telling followers she had been admitted to hospital.\n\nSin\u00e9ad O'Connor was a precocious talent who used music as a means of dealing with the demons inside her. A contradictory figure in many ways, she always refused to toe the establishment line, something that saw her achieve less success than she deserved.\n\nThe singer though was unapologetic and unrepentant for those life choices. \"I always say, if you live with the devil, you find out there's a god.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can visit the BBC Action Line for help.", "Texas' Republican-run House of Representatives has voted to impeach state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, who is accused of bribery and abuse of public trust.\n\nMr Paxton, an ally of former President Donald Trump, is now suspended from office pending a trial in the Senate.\n\nA two-thirds vote in the upper chamber - where Republicans also dominate - is required to permanently expel him.\n\nMr Paxton, aged 60, denies all the accusations against him.\n\nResponding to a 121-23 vote in the House on Saturday, Mr Paxton said in a statement: \"The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just.\n\n\"It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.\"\n\nThe impeachment vote was on 20 articles, which also include accusations of improperly aiding a wealthy political donor and conducting a sham investigation against whistleblowers.\n\nThe result demonstrates a very public split between Texas Republicans.\n\n\"Attorney General Paxton continuously and blatantly violated laws, rules, policies and procedures,\" House Republican David Spiller said.\n\n\"Today is a very grim and difficult day for this House and for the state of Texas,\" he added.\n\nBut John Smithee, another Texas House Republican, opposed the impeachment, arguing that the attorney general had not been given the chance to properly respond to the allegations against him.\n\n\"It's what I call the hang him now and judge him later policy,\" Mr Smithee said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump - who hopes to win a Republican nomination for the 2024 election - backed Mr Paxton.\n\nShortly before the vote, he wrote \"free Ken Paxton\" in a post on social media.\n\nMr Paxton (left) and Mr Trump greet one another at a rally for Trump in Texas last year\n\nThe House vote makes Mr Paxton the first state official in Texas to be impeached in almost 50 years.\n\nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has the powers to appoint an interim state attorney general even before the Senate trial is concluded.\n\nMr Paxton is well-known in America for his high-profile litigation campaigns.\n\nIn 2020, he unsuccessfully pressed the US Supreme Court to overturn Mr Trump's defeat to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election.\n\nFive years earlier, Mr Paxton called the Supreme Court's decision legalising gay marriage in all 50 states a \"lawless ruling\", vowing to support state workers who refuse to marry couples on religious grounds.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for spearheading the ongoing fight in the courts to challenge the Biden administration's changes to the immigration system.\n\nMr Paxton has said the measures he is fighting would encourage illegal crossings and burden Texas and other states with additional expenses for law enforcement, health care and education, the New York Times reports.", "Britons travelling to France may face disruption and are advised to monitor the media, the Foreign Office has said, as the country grapples with widespread rioting.\n\nIn new travel advice, the government urged Britons to avoid the riots, saying their locations and timings were \"unpredictable\".\n\nThey also said it was \"more important than ever\" to get travel insurance.\n\nRiots began on Tuesday after police shot a 17-year-old of Algerian descent.\n\nNahel M was killed as he drove away from a traffic stop.

This is often a sign that a vessel is engaged in illegal fishing.\n\n\"It's estimated that illegal or unregulated fishing is as much as 20% of what's caught,\" says David Kroodsma, head of the research team at Global Fishing Watch.\n\nSuch illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing may catch as much as 26 million tonnes of fish every year, or one in every five fish, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. It says that in financial terms this black market is worth up to $23bn (\u00a318bn).\n\nThis contributes significantly to overfishing, with the UN adding that a third of global fish stocks are now being fished beyond biologically sustainable levels. For example it's estimated that the population of bluefin tuna, is just 2.6% of its historic, unfished size.\n\nDavid Kroodsma says that illegal fishing needs to be more seriously tackled\n\n\"Sharks and rays are at the brink of extinction,\" says Mr Kroodsma. \"You have extinction threats to sea birds and turtles from bycatch. It is really sad, because we could manage the oceans so much better.\"\n\nGlobal Fishing Watch was co-founded by Google, marine conservation body Oceana, and environmental group SkyTruth. The latter studies satellite images to spot environmental damage.\n\nTo try to better monitor and quantify the problem of overfishing, Global Fishing Watch is now using increasingly sophisticated AI software, and satellite imagery, to globally map the movements of more than 65,000 commercial fishing vessels, both those with - and without - AIS.\n\nThe AI analyses millions of gigabytes of satellite imagery to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure. It then looks at publicly accessible data from ships' AIS signals, and combines this with radar and optical imagery to identify vessels that fail to broadcast their positions.\n\nAnd while not all ships are legally required to use AIS, the AI and its \"fishing detection algorithm\" aims to work out which of these \"dark\" vessels are likely to be engaging in fishing.\n\n\"We use information like the length of the vessel, plus environmental information as to where that vessel is located, the imaging of the area, the density of vessel traffic in the area, the state of the ocean, like the temperature - a bunch of information on where the vessel is operating,\" says Fernando Paolo, Global Fishing Watch's senior remote sensing machine learning engineer.\n\n\"And this model infers whether the vessel is likely a fishing vessel or not a fishing vessel, like passenger vessels, oil tankers, shipping vessels and that kind of stuff.\"\n\nThe researchers have found that three quarters of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, with particular hot spots around Africa and South Asia.\n\nGlobal Fishing Watch is now working to introduce higher-resolution imagery to help spot more smaller fishing vessels.\n\nGlobal Fishing Watch creates a map where the darker the orange the more fishing in an area is not publicly tracked\n\nHowever, stamping out illegal fishing means getting data as quickly as possible - and a project from the University of Southampton and local firm RS Aqua is aiming to do just that.\n\nThe team is building a submarine robot that uses underwater sensors and AI to identify the sound of fishing, and transmit the information in real time. The AI can already differentiate between the natural sounds of the ocean, and is now being trained to identify the noise of trawlers operating in protected waters.\n\n\"Part of the drive of the project is to try and put something in place that would help monitor fishing activity within marine protected areas [MPAs],\" says University of Southampton professor of statistical signal processing Paul White.\n\n\"There's a definite concern that by creating these ecosystems with higher densities of fish, those are going to be attractive to fishermen.\"\n\nCurrently there are around 15,000 MPAs around the globe, which account for 8% of the world's oceans. Yet one study says that less than half are actually \"fully protected\" from fishing.\n\nMr White says the aim is that if the robot senses fishing, it will automatically contact authorities who can send out a patrol vessel.\n\nHe adds: \"Exactly what form of AI we're going to use, we've not completely fixed on yet. Part of the problem is that for this to work it has to sit in the ocean for many months. You can't put something out in one week and then have to go back and change the batteries.\n\n\"It's got to be very power efficient, which means you can't have very complicated algorithms running, but they need to be sufficiently powerful to distinguish something like trawler noise from other sources of noise in the ocean.\"\n\nThe University of Southampton's underwater robot, pictured, is being trained to recognise the sound of fishing\n\nPaul Lansbergen, chair of the International Coalition of Fisheries, says that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) \"is a scourge of the industry\".\n\n\"The sustainability impacts and economic damages are very real, but it's also no longer an issue that persists in the shadows. Industry leaders, policy makers, and associated stakeholders are all focusing on the challenge.\n\n\"Emerging technology, like AI, is complementary to traditional law enforcement and placing IUU in the cross hairs. But consumers also need to make sustainable choices and make it tougher on IUU fishers.

In July, Panorama gathered data from 39 hospital trusts, which showed three-quarters of people discharged were untested.\n\nUp to this point more than 5,700 care home residents had died in England and Wales (either in homes or in hospital).\n\nPublic Health England has published research into the impact of hospital transfers. It found that 1.6% of the lab-confirmed outbreaks in care homes that they knew about by mid-October 2020, had come from people discharged from hospitals.\n\nBut it is not clear what percentage of outbreaks up to 15 April (when the testing policy changed) were the result of patients being moved to homes.\n\nAnd it is important to note that, at this time, there was a lack of testing so not every outbreak may have been recorded. Also, the figures do not count people who were not previously care home residents who were transferred into them from hospitals.\n\nThe government has repeatedly said that decisions to discharge patients from hospitals during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn March 2020, specific guidance related to coronavirus said that the PPE in care homes should be similar to that used in hospital settings.\n\nThe government launched the National Supply Disruption Response on 13 March, a centralised line for care and health providers to raise concerns.\n\nThis was followed on 19 March by a promise to deliver 300 masks to each care provider.\n\nConcerns over PPE peaked at the end of March and early April, as bodies such as Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and care homes themselves highlighted shortages.\n\nBecause care homes are generally privately-run, they are responsible for purchasing their own PPE. Many found their local suppliers were running low and that they were competing with better-funded hospitals.\n\nA letter from the government on 2 April recognised \"the challenges providers may have experienced in obtaining PPE supplies over recent weeks,\" and promised that the supply chain would be bolstered, with support from the armed forces.\n\nOn 10 April the government announced a PPE action plan, which included freeing up 34 million pieces of equipment to \"local resilience forums\" who would then distribute it to care homes through local authorities.\n\nBy this point, 3,100 care home residents had died in England and Wales.\n\nGeneral guidance produced on 25 February 2020 included advice for carers on what to do if they came into contact with someone with Covid-19 - but there was nothing advising against visits to care homes.\n\nIn one section it said: \"It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.\"\n\nAnother section said: \"Currently there is no evidence of transmission of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom. There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present.\"\n\nHowever, the government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had advised on 10 February that \"it is a realistic probability that there is already sustained transmission in the UK, or that it will become established in the coming weeks.\"\n\nOn 3 March, the government released its coronavirus action plan - the document did not mention restricting visits to care homes.\n\nBy 5 March, England had had 273 cases of people with the virus.\n\nThat day Prof Chris Whitty told a committee of MPs that as there were cases that could not be traced back to people who had come from abroad, it was \"highly likely therefore that there is some level of community transmission in this virus in the UK now\".\n\nItaly suspended visits to care homes at this point, five weeks after recording its first case. A day later, Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents hundreds of care homes in Ireland, banned non-essential visits, just six days after the first confirmed case in the country.\n\nOn 10 March, Prof Martin Green, head of Care England, which represents independent care providers, directed criticism in an Independent article at the government for its response.\n\n\"There is no evidence of a plan. I'm not even certain they have these plans and aren't just making them up as they go along,\" he said.\n\nSome homes were already deciding to close their doors to visitors, with care groups Barchester and HC-One stopping non-essential visits on 10 March and 12 March.\n\nScottish Care - a representative body for social care in Scotland - advised care homes to close to visits on 11 March.\n\nOn 13 March, the government's guidance from 25 February was updated to say that \"care home providers are advised to review their visiting policy, by asking no-one to visit who has suspected Covid-19 or is generally unwell, and by emphasising good hand hygiene for visitors\".\n\nOn the same day, Bupa and Four Seasons care homes stopped non-essential visits.\n\nIt wasn't until 16 March that it was announced that social distancing should be carried out by everyone, in particular those aged over 70 and vulnerable people.\n\nThat day, the prime minister was asked about care homes and said: \"We don't want to see people unnecessarily visiting care homes.\"\n\nIn the period between 25 February and 16 March, 14 deaths of care home residents were reported along with 30 outbreaks in England's 15,000 care homes.\n\nOn 21 March, guidance was introduced to encourage medically vulnerable people to remain indoors as much as possible until the end of June - a process known as shielding.\n\nFinally, on 2 April a document from the Department of Health and Social Care said that \"family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life\".\n\nThis piece was originally published in July 2020.", "Intense and widespread rioting has been taking place across France, following the shooting of a 17-year-old during a traffic stop.\n\nVideo on social media showed the moment the police shooting of Nahel M took place, in the Paris suburb of Nanterre on 27 June.\n\nRiots erupted later that same day and have continued each day since, spreading throughout the country.\n\nThe officer involved has apologised to the family and been charged with voluntary homicide.", "During an eventful day in court, Alex Murdaugh maintained that he didn't kill his wife and son, but admitted lying and faced intense questioning from the prosecution.", "Blume said banning books \"has become political... it's worse than it was in the 80s\"\n\nAuthor Judy Blume has said she is worried about intolerance in the US, after some of her novels were removed from schools.\n\nSome books have been removed from school libraries in the US due to concerns about how they explore complex themes of sex, race or gender identity.\n\nOne of Blume's novels was recently pulled in a Florida school district.\n\nBlume told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg banning books \"has become political... it's worse than it was in the 80s\".\n\nAsked if she was worried about intolerance in the US, she replied: \"Absolutely, intolerance about everything, gender, sexuality, racism.\n\n\"It's just reaching a point where again we have to fight back, we have to stand up and fight.\"\n\nBlume's novels have been translated into 32 languages and sold more than 90 million copies, according to recent figures reported by The Washington Post.\n\nA screen adaptation of the author's 1970 novel Are You There God?

It's Me, Margaret\n\nThe novel follows a young girl exploring her religious and sexual identity as she confronts adolescent anxieties about reaching puberty.\n\nThe book won several literary awards and has remained popular with teenage girls, but it has also attracted controversy both at the time of its publication and more recently, for how openly it discusses sexuality and religion.\n\nAsked about book banning, Blume told Kuenssberg: \"I thought that was over frankly, I thought we had come through that, you know, not in every way, but I never expected us to be back where we were in the 80s plus, much worse.\n\n\"I came through the 80s when book banning was really at its height.

Slightly scary.\"", "On Monday, thousands of junior doctors in England will start a 72-hour strike. They want a 35% pay rise. Yet doctors are among the highest paid in the public sector. So why do they have the biggest pay claim?\n\nThe origins of the walkout by British Medical Association members - the biggest by doctors in the history of the NHS - can be found in a series of discussions on social media platform Reddit in late 2021.\n\nA collection of junior doctors were expressing their dissatisfaction about pay.\n\nThe numbers chatting online grew quickly and by January 2022 it had led to the formation of the campaign group Doctors Vote, with the aim of restoring pay to the pre-austerity days of 2008.\n\nThe group began spreading its message via social media - and, within months, its supporters had won 26 of the 69 voting seats on the BMA ruling council, and 38 of the 68 on its junior doctor committee.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Rob Laurenson stood for BMA election on a Doctors Vote platform\n\nTwo of those who stood on the Doctors Vote platform - Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi - became co-chairs of the committee.\n\n\"It was simply a group of doctors connecting up the dots,\" Dr Laurenson says. \"We reflect the vast majority of doctors,\" he adds, pointing to the mandate from the wider BMA junior doctor membership - 77% voted and of those, 98% backed strike action.\n\nAmong some of the older BMA heads, though, there is a sense of disquiet at the new guard. One senior doctor who has now stood down from a leadership role says: \"They're undoubtedly much more radical than we have seen before. But they haven't read the room - the pay claim makes them look silly.\"\n\nPublicly, the BMA prefers not to talk about wanting a pay rise. Instead, it uses the term \"pay restoration\" - to reverse cuts of 26% since 2008. This is the amount pay has fallen once inflation is taken into account.\n\nTo rectify a cut of 26% requires a bigger percentage increase because the amount is lower. This is why the BMA is actually after a 35% increase - and it is a rise it is calling for to be paid immediately.\n\nThe argument is more complicated than the ones put forward by most other unions - and because of that it has raised eyebrows.\n\nFirstly, no junior doctor has seen pay cut by 26% in that period. There are five core pay points in the junior doctor contract with each a springboard to the next. It means they move up the pay scale over time until they finish their training.\n\nA junior doctor in 2008 may well be a consultant now, perhaps earning four times in cash terms what they were then.\n\nSecondly, the 26% figure uses the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation, which the Office for National Statistics says is a poor way to look at rising prices. Using the more favoured consumer price index measure, the cut is 16% - although the BMA defends its use of RPI as it takes into account housing costs.\n\n\"The drop in pay is also affected by the start-year chosen,\" Lucina Rolewicz, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, says. A more recent start date will show a smaller decline, as would going further back in the 2000s.\n\nAnother way of looking at pay is comparing it with wages across the economy by looking at where a job sits in terms of the lowest to highest earners.\n\nThe past decade has not been a boom time for wage growth in many fields, as austerity and the lack of economic growth has held back incomes.\n\nLast year, the independent Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration Body looked at this. It found junior doctors had seen their pay, relative to others, fall slightly during the 2010s, but were still among the highest earners, with doctors fresh out of university immediately finding themselves in the top half of earners, while those at the end of training were just outside the top 10%.\n\nThen, of course, career prospects have to be considered. Consultants earn well more than \u00a3100,000 on average, putting them in the top 2%. GP partners earn even more.\n\nA pension of more than \u00a360,000 a year in today's prices also awaits those reaching such positions.\n\nBut while the scale of the pay claim is new, dissatisfaction with working conditions and pay pre-date the rise of the Doctors Vote movement.\n\nStudying medicine at university takes five years, meaning big debts for most. Dr Trivedi says \u00a380,000 of student loans are often topped up by private debt.\n\nOn top of that, doctors have to pay for ongoing exams and professional membership fees. Their junior doctor training can see them having to make several moves across the country and with little control over the hours they work. Their contract means they are required to work a minimum of 40 hours and up to 48 on average - additional payments are made to reflect this.\n\nThis lasts many years - junior doctors can commonly spend close to a decade in training.\n\nIt is clearly hard work. And with services getting increasingly stretched, it is a job that doctors say is leaving them \"demoralised, angry and exhausted\", Dr Trivedi says, adding: \"Patient care is being compromised.\"\n\nBut while medicine is undoubtedly tough, it remains hugely attractive.\n\nJunior doctor posts in the early years are nearly always filled - it is not until doctors begin to specialise later in their training that significant gaps emerge in some specialities such as end-of-life care and sexual health.\n\nLooking at all doctor vacancy rates across the NHS around 6% of posts are unfilled - for nurses it is nearly twice that level.\n\nMany argue there is still a shortage - with not enough training places or funded doctor posts in the NHS in the first place.\n\nBut the fact the problems appear more severe in other NHS roles is a key reason why the government does not seem to be in a hurry to prioritise doctors - formal pay talks to avert strikes have begun with unions representing the rest of the workforce\n\n\"If we have some money to give a pay rise to NHS staff,\" a source close to the negotiations says, \"doctors are not at the front of the queue.\"\n\nUpdate: This article was updated on 18 May 2023 to make it clear doctors can be required to work up to 48 hours and the footnote on the first chart has changed 'overtim' to 'additional hours'.\n\nAre you taking part in the strike action?

It was so demanding a game. It was not comfortable.\n\n\"Now I have to relax - a day off for the guys, prepare for Leicester [in the Premier League on Saturday].\"\n\nRodri broke the deadlock in spectacular fashion with a curling left-foot drive into the top corner after 27 minutes while Bayern had chances of their own, especially former City forward Leroy Sane, who brought a vital save out of Ederson early in the second half.\n\nCity were always a threat and extended their lead with 20 minutes left, Haaland crossing perfectly for Bernardo Silva to head home after Jack Grealish stole possession off Dayot Upemecano.\n\nHaaland was not to be denied himself and he pounced for City's third six minutes later, getting on the end of John Stones' headed knockdown to sweep a finish past Bayern keeper Yann Sommer.\n\n\"It was an incredible result but I know a little bit what can happen in Munich,\" added Guardiola, who managed Bayern Munich from 2013 until 2016, winning three league titles and two domestic doubles.\n\n\"If you don't perform really well they are able to score one, two, three. I know that, the players know that.\n\n\"It's an incredible result, but we have to do our game with huge, huge personality. If we don't do our game anything can happen.\n\n\"To knock out these teams you have to have two good games, not just one.\"\n\nHaaland's record breaking will capture the headlines as the 22-year-old Norwegian's voracious appetite for goals shows no sign of being satisfied.\n\nThis, however, was much more than a one-man show as Guardiola's side had outstanding performers in all areas as they go in pursuit of the one major trophy that has remained tantalisingly out of reach during the manager's years of huge success at Etihad Stadium.\n\nCity have had mishaps before in the Champions League and will face either holders Real Madrid or Chelsea in a potentially hazardous last-four assignment if they complete what should be the formality of the second leg in Munich, but they look in perfect shape.\n\nAnd in Haaland, they have the goal machine that gives an already outstanding side an added edge amid the fine margins of Europe's elite competition.\n\nThey also have a midfield powerhouse in Rodri, whose goal set them on their way, while they defended with real resilience, Nathan Ake continuing an outstanding season with a faultless performance.\n\nBernardo Silva showed all his creative powers as well as scoring the crucial second goal while Jack Grealish's tireless performance was exemplified by the manner in which he nicked the ball off Upamecano in the build-up to that goal.\n\nThree goals and clean sheet was a fair reward for City's superiority and it will surely now take something extraordinary to stop them taking their place in another semi-final.\n\nThomas Tuchel declared his delight at being back in England for this Champions League quarter-final, having recently succeed Julian Naglesmann at Bayern Munich, but there was not much else for the former Chelsea manager to be happy about on this rain-sodden Manchester night.\n\nTuchel's task is to get Bayern back at Europe's top table and his constant agitation in the technical area was an indicator of how big his task is. The Bundesliga is almost taken for granted at Bayern but this fiercely ambitious club wants more and they were well beaten here.\n\nThis outstanding coach has proved his quality in the past but he will need to be a miracle worker to get Bayern out of the hole they fell into at Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"I try to not allow my players to focus on the result,\" Tuchel said. \"I think it is not a deserved result, it does not tell the story of this match.\n\n\"We played with personality, courage and a lot of quality but we didn't get the rewards we deserved.\n\n\"This does not feel a 3-0 but it is a 3-0.

Watch: Lisa Telling said Ruth knew her school's Ofsted result for 54 days but couldn't tell her staff\n\nStopping school inspections in England would be \"against children's best interests\", Ofsted's chief has said.\n\nTeachers have called for them to be paused, after head teacher Ruth Perry took her own life while waiting for a report that downgraded her school from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate\".\n\nAmanda Spielman said inspections are important for both schools and parents.\n\nIt comes as the BBC can reveal Ms Perry had been \"delighted\" with feedback from Ofsted in an informal visit in 2019.\n\nInspectors had visited Caversham Primary School as part of a programme of informal visits to pilot a new inspection framework.\n\nOfsted has confirmed to the BBC's education editor Branwen Jeffreys that Ms Spielman attended in person to observe the visit.\n\nIn a newsletter to parents at the time, Ms Perry said she was \"incredibly proud\" of how well pupils and staff responded to the experience, adding that the feedback had been \"overwhelmingly positive\".\n\nBut after a formal inspection in November 2022, Ms Perry's school was rated as inadequate as a result of failings in training, record-keeping and checks on staff. The Ofsted report added that Caversham Primary School provided a good education and a welcoming and vibrant community for children.\n\nFollowing Ms Perry's death, Ms Spielman has said a debate about reforming inspections to remove grades was a \"legitimate one\", but added that any changes to the system \"would have to meet the needs both of parents and of government\".\n\nOfsted inspectors give ratings of either outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate.\n\nMs Spielman said those ratings \"give parents a simple and accessible summary of a school's strengths and weaknesses\".\n\nBut Paul Gosling, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the one-word assessments were too simplistic to sum up the complexity of school life.\n\nMs Perry's family has said her death was a \"direct result of the pressure\" caused by the school inspection.\n\nLisa Telling, a head teacher in Reading who knew Ms Perry well, said she had been under \"enormous stress\" and \"knew the outcome of her report but was unable to tell her staff\".\n\n\"As a head teacher, when you get your result and your final feedback, currently the system does not allow you to share that. That's a huge piece of information to hold on to,\" she said.\n\nOfsted's handbook says school leaders can share the provisional findings of inspections with those responsible for the governance of the school, as long as they are marked as confidential and subject to change.\n\nMrs Telling told BBC Breakfast that Ms Perry was restricted from sharing the \"world-destroying\" verdict for 54 days before she died.\n\nMr Gosling said school leaders should be allowed to speak to \"a range of people who might be able to support them\" if they were concerned by an Ofsted result.\n\nRuth Perry was the head at Caversham Primary School in Reading\n\nSince Ms Perry's death, some head teachers have removed references to Ofsted from websites, job adverts and letters.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the National Education Union handed a petition to the government calling for Ofsted to be replaced.\n\nIn Reading, headteachers' groups have written to the government asking for an urgent review of the system.\n\nMs Spielman said it would be wrong to say too much ahead of the coroner's inquest.\n\n\"Our school inspectors are all former or serving school leaders,\" she added. \"They understand the vital work head teachers do and the pressures they are under.\"\n\nSome head teachers, including Flora Cooper from Berkshire, are wearing black armbands during school inspections, following Ms Perry's suicide\n\nMs Spielman acknowledged inspections \"can be challenging\" but said inspectors always aimed to conduct them \"with sensitivity as well as professionalism\".\n\nBut school improvement adviser Julie Price-Grimshaw said that was \"definitely not the case\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC 5 Live Breakfast, she said many head teachers were getting \"very ill, stressed and having breakdowns\" as a result of inspections.\n\nMs Price-Grimshaw, who used to be an Ofsted inspector, said it was \"impossible for teachers and head teachers to raise standards if they're feeling broken, demoralised, stressed and anxious\".\n\nBut one vice-principal, at a secondary school in West Yorkshire, said Ofsted inspectors \"came across as human and had collaborative conversations with staff\", during a recent visit.\n\nHe said the inspection process was \"intense and extremely stressful\", but added that it resulted in an \"honest reflection of where our school is at\".\n\nMs Spielman said Ofsted aimed \"to make inspections as collaborative and constructive as we can\" and would remain focused on improving how it worked with schools, and \"how inspections feel for school staff\".\n\nShe admitted it was a difficult time to be a head teacher, particularly since the pandemic, as absence was high, mental health problems had increased and \"external support services are unable to meet increased demand\".\n\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article you can visit the BBC Action Line pages, or contact Samaritans.\n\nA Department for Education official said Ofsted had a crucial role to play in upholding education standards and ensuring children were safe in school: \"They provide independent, up-to-date evaluations on the quality of education, safeguarding and leadership, which parents greatly rely on to give them confidence in choosing the right school for their child.\"\n\nA spokesman for the prime minister added: \"We're confident the current rating system provides the right level of transparency for parents.\"", "A world-renowned cancer centre hit by whistleblowing concerns over alleged bullying has been downgraded by the health watchdog.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) told The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester it \"requires improvement\" in safety and leadership.\n\nA former trust nurse told the BBC leaders had intimidated staff to stop them voicing concerns to inspectors.\n\nThe trust said it was working hard to ensure staff felt supported.\n\nRebecca Wight worked at The Christie - Europe's largest cancer centre - from 2014 but quit her role as an advanced nurse practitioner in December, claiming her whistleblowing attempts had been ignored.\n\nShe told BBC Newsnight the trust had attempted to manipulate the inspection by intimidating those who wished to paint an honest picture.\n\n\"The well-led inspection was basically run by The Christie,\" she said.\n\n\"The CQC requested a few forums with clinical staff. Those forums were infiltrated by leaders.\n\n\"The forum I went to was attended by senior leaders in the executive team.\"\n\nMs Wight said it was done \"to intimidate staff to not speak up or maybe not speak openly about leadership\".\n\nMs Wight said she and others wrote to the CQC to warn inspectors they were only getting a carefully controlled and inaccurate picture.\n\nAs a result, an off-site session was arranged by the CQC, she said, \"for people to come anonymously and speak to them\".\n\nRoger Kline, an NHS workforce and culture expert from Middlesex University Business School, told BBC Newsnight there was a culture at The Christie which was \"unwelcoming of people raising concerns\".\n\nHe said: \"The trust response is more likely... to see the person raising the concerns as the problem rather than the issues they have raised,\" adding this was \"not good for patient care\".\n\nFollowing the downgrading of the trust's rating, Mr Kline said leaders should now consider their positions, adding: \"I think for a trust like The Christie, a small specialist trust, any form of downgrading is a significant problem.\"\n\nRoger Kline said there was \"poor governance\" at The Christie\n\nThe Christie had been rated as \"outstanding\" in its previous two CQC inspections.\n\nDowngrading the trust's rating to \"good\" following its latest inspection, the CQC criticised The Christie's workplace culture, highlighting that staff did not always feel listened to.\n\nIt followed an NHS England review in February 2022 which found the trust had been \"defensive and dismissive\" when staff raised concerns about bullying and a \u00a320m research project.\n\nThe CQC said while there was some \"outstanding practice\" at The Christie - and praised its commitment to research and innovation to improve cancer patients' outcomes - a number of improvements were required, notably in safety and leadership.\n\nThe report said: \"Very senior executives were heavily invested in the promotion and protection of the trust's reputation.\n\n\"This impacted negatively on some staff; staff did not always feel supported and valued.\n\n\"A minority of staff expressed reservations about raising concerns and others did not always feel listened to.\"\n\nThe CQC's Northern operations director Ann Ford said: \"Although the trust had made some changes to improve the culture, more work needs to be done to address the issues we identified.\"\n\nShe thanked staff who came forward to give feedback, adding: \"I know speaking up in these circumstances isn't easy but it's important it happens.\"\n\nMs Ford praised medical care at the trust, saying \"staff treated people with compassion and kindness, respected their privacy and dignity and met people's individual needs\".\n\nThey also provided emotional support to people, families and carers, she added.\n\n\"However, they didn't always carry out risk assessments in a timely manner which potentially put people at risk of harm.\"\n\nMs Ford praised The Christie's \"research and innovation to improve outcomes for people with cancer and the trust and everyone involved should be proud of that important work\".\n\nBBC Newsnight put the claims about how the inspection process was handled to The Christie but it declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the CQC.\n\nTrust chief executive Roger Spencer said: \"We are pleased the CQC has rated us 'good' despite the difficulties the NHS has faced over the past few years.\n\n\"Demand for cancer services has continued to rise, resulting in us treating more patients than ever before.\n\n\"We are working hard to make the improvements that have been highlighted by the CQC, ensuring that all our staff feel supported and valued and I thank all of them for continuing to put patients at the centre of everything we do.\"\n\nBBC Newsnight understands Mr Spencer wrote to staff on Thursday ahead of the CQC report's publication, pointing out that inspectors had advised the trust to continue its plan \"to ensure that our staff feel supported and valued and are able to speak up to raise concerns\".\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

But accounts and information developed throughout the day on Wednesday.\n\nThe NYPD confirmed an incident took place involving Harry and Meghan and said numerous photographers \"made their transport challenging\".\n\nNo injuries or arrests were reported, the police said. Buckingham Palace has not yet commented.\n\nEntertainment picture agency Backgrid issued a statement saying it was investigating the conduct of several freelance photographers, but that their initial account of events differed to that of the Sussexes.\n\n\"The photographers have reported feeling that the couple was not in immediate danger at any point,\" it said.\n\nIt followed claims the chase involved half a dozen cars, with reckless driving including going through red lights, driving on the pavement, carrying out blocking moves, and reversing down a one-way street - as well as taking photographs while driving.\n\nBBC News understands Harry and Meghan were staying at a friend's home, and did not return directly to avoid compromising their security.\n\nThe couple and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, tried to take shelter from the paparazzi by going to a Manhattan police station.\n\nThere was then a plan to use a New York taxi, with a yellow cab flagged down and Harry, Meghan, Ms Ragland and a security officer getting inside.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Mr Singh's account relates to just 10 minutes of what the Sussexes' spokesperson described as an ordeal lasting more than two hours.\n\nThe driver's assessment stands in contrast to that of Chris Sanchez, a member of the couple's security detail, who told CNN the scene was \"very chaotic\" and that photographers at one point blocked the limousine carrying Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"The public were in jeopardy at several points,\" he said. \"It could have been fatal.\"\n\nThe couple use private security while in the US - but Harry is engaged in a legal battle in London over the use of Metropolitan Police protection while he and his family are in the UK.\n\nMeghan appeared alongside her husband and mother to accept an award at the event in New York City\n\nThe award ceremony they attended - the Ms Foundation Women of Vision Awards - was Harry and Meghan's first public appearance together since the King Charles' Coronation earlier this month.\n\nMeghan accepted an award at the event alongside LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters that two police officers \"could have been injured\" and that it \"would be horrific to lose an innocent bystander during a chase like this\".\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's statement had never claimed there was a high-speed chase. It spoke of a \"relentless pursuit\" for more than two hours.\n\nDuncan Larcombe, the author of the book Prince Harry: the Inside Story, told BBC News it appeared \"something has gone extremely wrong\" with Harry and Meghan's security in the US.\n\n\"This will come as a huge surprise for people who used to look after Harry in the UK,\" he said. \"There are huge questions to be asked about whether the paparazzi can still operate in this way.\"\n\nPrince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a 1997 car crash in Paris while being chased by photographers.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC for the documentary Diana, 7 Days, Prince Harry referred to the paparazzi as \"a pack of dogs\" who constantly hounded his mother.\n\n\"Every single time she went out there'd be a pack of people waiting for her,\" he said. \"I mean a pack of dogs, followed her, chased her, harassed her, called her names, spat at her, trying to get a reaction, to get that photograph of her lashing out.\"\n\nPhotos taken last night show Prince Harry and Meghan leaving the Ziegfeld Theatre in Manhattan\n\nPrince Harry is currently involved in multiple legal disputes with the British tabloid press, including allegations of phone hacking and the unlawful gathering of information.\n\nEarlier this week, a lawyer for the prince told a London court that he should be allowed to challenge a government decision that denied him the ability to pay for police protection while in the country.\n\nThe pair stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US in 2020 - a move they said was partly due to harassment from UK tabloids.\n\nPrince Harry has described his battle to change the media as his \"life's work\".

But many airports and airlines that had made cuts during the pandemic struggled to recruit staff quickly enough.\n\nThey insist they've pulled out all the stops to make their operations more resilient this year.\n\nFor example, EasyJet told the BBC in March it started recruiting far earlier than usual and was already fully staffed for summer.\n\nHowever, there are different headaches this year, which could mean further disruption, although not necessarily on the scale of last year's problems.\n\nStrike action, notably by French air traffic controllers, has been causing cancellations and delays for months.\n\nFlights over France to destinations such as Spain and Portugal have also been affected, which Ryanair's boss has repeatedly complained about.\n\nHowever, some action has been called off. Eight days of strikes planned in July and August by ground handlers at Gatwick Airport will now not go ahead.\n\nMany airports struggled to cope last summer\n\nProposed summer strike action by security workers at Heathrow was called off after the Unite union accepted an improved pay offer.\n\nAnd at Birmingham Airport, a strike expected to involve more than 150 security staff and technicians has been suspended after a fresh pay offer.\n\nThe threat of strikes by European air traffic managers at Eurocontrol remains, but no dates have been set. The union involved told the BBC it hopes to reach an agreement with the employer.\n\nThe air traffic control environment is \"challenging\", according to Willie Walsh, who heads up global airline body Iata.\n\nEasyJet has already axed 1,700 summer flights at Gatwick to reduce the chance of last-minute cancellations, blaming what it called \"unprecedented\" air traffic limitations.\n\nEurope's air space remains constrained and clogged up due to the Ukraine war.\n\n\"In the event of French strikes some flights may be rerouted through other, already congested, air space which itself creates additional pressure,\" says aviation expert John Strickland.\n\n\"Manpower shortages in parts of Europe such as Greece and Denmark [are] causing capacity bottlenecks, which create further delays.\n\n\"Indeed one European airline CEO told me that the whole of European air traffic control except the UK was 'a mess'.\"\n\nMr Strickland thinks events like summer storms could add pressure to an already stretched system, leading to delays and cancellations.\n\nOn the railway, the plans of thousands of people going on day trips or holidays could be affected.\n\nRail workers in the RMT union at 14 train companies with government contracts walk out again on Saturday 29 July.\n\nTheir dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions has been going on for more than a year now.\n\nThe operators are all based in England but some run services into Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe level of disruption during these strikes will vary around the country. Many will run reduced services.\n\nStrike day timetables are published a week before each date.\n\nIt's worth checking before you set off.\n\nThese RMT strikes are happening after the union rejected the latest proposals from the industry, which is backed by the government.\n\nThe train companies are under pressure from the government to cut costs.

It matters if the public believes its public service broadcaster doesn't represent their views, or that the BBC is shaped by a particular perspective.\n\nDavie has previously said: \"If you want to be an opinionated columnist or a partisan campaigner on social media then that is a valid choice, but you should not be working at the BBC.\"\n\nAll staff and on-air talent are bound by \"due\" impartiality which the BBC is committed to achieving across its output.\n\nDirector general Tim Davie has said people who want to be opinionated columnists should not be working at the BBC\n\nOfcom defines due impartiality, an important distinction from simply impartiality, as \"means adequate or appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme\".\n\nTo use the classic example: If someone says the earth is round, the BBC does not have to give equal weight to someone else who claims the earth is flat.\n\nLineker is a sports presenter. He tweets on his personal Twitter account.\n\nIf a news presenter commented, as he has done, about the government's asylum policies, or about Brexit for example, they would at the very least receive a very serious warning.\n\nLineker, as somebody associated with sport for the BBC, and who argues he is a freelancer, is in a different position.\n\n\"I try to be sensible,\" he told Radio 4's Media Show in 2021, saying that as a freelancer he's \"considerate\" to his employers when it comes to what he tweets.\n\nHe added that the BBC rules \"only apply to people in news and current affairs\".\n\nFrom the outside, it can appear more complicated.\n\nThe BBC's editorial guidelines state: \"Where individuals identify themselves as being linked with the BBC, or are programme makers, editorial staff, reporters or presenters primarily associated with the BBC, their activities on social media have the potential to compromise the BBC's impartiality and to damage its reputation.\"\n\nLineker presents Match of the Day, the BBC's flagship football programme\n\nLineker's Twitter account has 8.7m followers. So he has a huge platform.\n\nAnd, whatever the set up of the BBC as a broadcaster, with sport and news being distinct from one another, for audiences that distinction can be less clear. In many people's minds, if you are on the BBC, you work for it, and Lineker happens to be one of corporation's most high profile presenters.\n\nThat's why the BBC's editorial guidelines also say that people with platforms have a greater responsibility to uphold impartiality.\n\nLast year, a different tweet by Lineker was found to have broken BBC rules. That concerned a post about the then-Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urging a boycott of the Champions League final in Russia.\n\nThe Match of the Day host added: \"And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?\"\n\nThe BBC's Executive Complaints Unit ruled that, although the star is not required to uphold the same impartiality standards as BBC journalists, he has an \"additional responsibility\" because of his profile.\n\n\"We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters,\" the ruling said.\n\nTo his detractors, Lineker has form. He has made comments before that some have found controversial, including, in 2016, that the government's treatment of asylum seekers was \"hideously racist and utterly heartless\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Voicing an opinion on a government policy about migrant crossings, a divisive subject, is not the same thing as highlighting well-documented human rights breaches in Qatar, something which is a matter of fact.\n\nThe BBC is in a difficult position. They say a \"frank\" conversation is being had with Lineker. But in the end, what are the options?\n\nWith some Conservative MPs calling for him to be sacked, not for the first time, the pressure is mounting.\n\nPerceptions on impartiality matter, but it's also clear that impartiality can be politicised by people who have an agenda against the BBC.\n\nAs it navigates the demands of its editorial standards, its talent and its audiences, the BBC is walking a tightrope.", "Barrie Evans wants to see patients offered mental health support before an amputation\n\nWhen Barrie Evans had his left leg amputated he felt he had \"nothing to live for\".\n\n\"I couldn't support my family, I couldn't pay my bills, I ended up on suicide watch,\" said Barrie, 60, from Rogerstone, Newport.\n\nHe now runs a support group and is calling for more mental health aid for those who experience limb loss.\n\nThe Welsh government said deciding appropriate rehabilitation services was the responsibility of health boards.\n\nBarrie lost his leg in October 2018. He has type 2 diabetes, which can reduce blood supply to the feet, meaning foot injuries do not heal as well and infections can develop. In serious cases amputations can be needed.\n\nBarrie says walking his wife Trish down the aisle was a big motivation during his rehabilitation\n\nHe had already had a femoral artery bypass - an operation to bypass a blocked portion of an artery - in his left leg after being bitten by a spider when on holiday in Spain.\n\nThen, in 2018, Barrie dropped a scaffold board on his right foot. It became infected and he developed sepsis, and had to have two toes and part of the underside of his foot amputated, as well as another femoral artery bypass.\n\nWhile in hospital his left leg also became infected, resulting in a below-knee amputation.\n\nTwo days after the amputation, he became depressed.\n\n\"They took the bandage off and I looked at it and I thought 'where is my foot? Where's my ankle? Where's my shin?' and that's when it really hit me,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt changed, I felt disgusted with the way I'd led my life which had brought me to this. I went downhill.\"\n\nHe returned home where he had to wait for his wound to heal before he could begin rehabilitation.\n\nSince his amputation, Barrie has taken part in triathlons and plays wheelchair rugby\n\n\"I just had nothing to live for,\" he said.\n\n\"I spent nearly seven months on my own in my living room\u2026 I slept in my room, I washed in my room, I had a commode so I went to the toilet in my room.\n\n\"I couldn't be bothered. I just wanted to die. That's when the mental health team got involved.\"\n\nBarrie eventually got the mental health support he needed and now works for charity Limbless Association.\n\nHe said he was determined that no other amputee should go through what he went through.\n\nHe runs a group that meets on the first Thursday of every month at Heath Citizens Community Hall at Heath Park, Cardiff.\n\nKatherine (second from left) lost her leg in 2017, but it was not until 2020 that her mental health faltered\n\nLike Barrie, Katherine Williams, from Baglan, Port Talbot, also hit rock bottom after having her leg amputated.\n\nThe 37-year-old has type 1 diabetes, which can increase someone's risk of fractures.\n\nIn 2016 she thought she had twisted her ankle when putting washing on the line, but after walking on it for a year she discovered it was broken.\n\nShe spent months in a cast and had multiple operations which all failed before her leg was amputated below the knee in August 2017.\n\nKatherine (pictured on her wedding day third from left) has type 1 diabetes which can increase someone's risk of fractures\n\nKatherine said she coped immediately after the operation but during the coronavirus lockdown she hit rock bottom.\n\n\"I hadn't been sleeping properly, I'd been sitting up in a living room on my own most nights crying and I didn't know why,\" she said.\n\nOne night she was putting her young daughter to bed and her alarm went off to say her blood sugar levels were low.\n\n\"I thought, 'I can't be bothered, I'm just going to slip into a coma and die',\" she said.\n\nThankfully her wife also heard the alarm and woke up and forced her to eat.\n\nShe had also stopped caring about things that would previously have been important to her, such as Christmas.\n\nKatherine had her leg amputated below the knee in 2017\n\nEventually she spoke to her GP and realised the trauma of being diagnosed with diabetes at 15 and losing her leg had caught up with her. She was put on antidepressants and directed to mental health support websites.\n\nShe said within two months she was back to her normal self.\n\nReflecting on losing her leg, she said: \"I had really, really good physical help but not once did anyone even ask if I was coping mentally with it\u2026 to this day no-one's ever asked.\n\n\"I still haven't had any mental health counselling\u2026 no-one's mentioned anything about counselling.\"\n\nShe would like to see mental health support offered to patients before and after an amputation.\n\nBeresford Wille says loneliness can be an issue after an amputation\n\nBeresford Wille, 75, from Monmouth, who attends Barrie's support group, lost his right leg after being taken to hospital with a blood clot in June 2021. He too struggled after his amputation.\n\n\"I was put into a hospital room\u2026 where you've got nobody to talk to, nobody holding your hand, you wake up, you feel alone, desolate\u2026 but then you think 'well I'm not dead, I'm alive' and being alive is worth living isn't it,\" he said.\n\nHe said having contact with other amputees had been a big support.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is loneliness\u2026 having a phone call every day off somebody would help, just contact really,\" he said.\n\nAnthony Wintle, pictured with his wife Judith, lost his leg in August\n\nAnthony Wintle, 76, from Bedwas in Caerphilly county, attended the group for the first time this month.\n\nHe has type 2 diabetes and lost his leg in August after damaging his toes when he tripped over after going to a rugby match.\n\n\"[The hospital] did look after me before the amputation but afterwards once you've had the leg off and you're alright, that's it, you're just another person in the bed,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't have psychiatric help in there at all, before or after.\"\n\nAnthony said after returning home from hospital he was stuck in his house for three months because his wheelchair could not get through his door.\n\n\"It was a bit disconcerting to say the least,\" he said.\n\nHe said when he was in crisis there was no-one lined up to speak to.\n\n\"When I was upset, in the night if somebody had come then I could have talked to them. But there was no chance of getting that because by the time you call them up it's a fortnight before they can come, so you've gone past that stage of needing help and you've gone onto something else,\" he said.\n\nDavid Cox says he values meeting other amputees who understand his situation\n\nDavid Cox from Newport, who has type 2 diabetes and has lost both his legs and a hand, likes to come to the group to meet people who understand his situation and share vital information.\n\n\"Things like how you get your driving licence back,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also nice to meet people in the same situation as yourself and have a cup of coffee and a chat.\"\n\nBarrie wants to see a number of things put in place to support new amputees, including to see mental health teams getting involved with a patient before the amputation.\n\n\"I honestly believe that speaking to another amputee, a longer term amputee, would be most beneficial for all pre-elective amputees,\" he said.\n\nHe said support from staff in hospitals and rehabilitation centres was brilliant but it was the gap in between that had been neglected.\n\n\"When you come out of the hospital there is no support anywhere.

And to my embarrassment I didn't even really understand what either of them were talking about.\n\n\"When I got back to Britain I began to read up on Sir Charles.\"\n\nLaura Trevelyan as a young BBC reporter in the historic town of Carrickfergus, County Antrim\n\nAmid all the recent publicity about her family's connection to the slave trade, she expected questions to be also asked about what happened during the Irish famine.\n\nIn the 1830s, after the abolition of slavery, the Trevelyan family received about \u00a334,000 in official compensation, the equivalent of about \u00a33m in modern money.\n\nAsked for her personal view of Sir Charles Trevelyan, she said: \"When I wrote a book in 2006, A Very British Family, I'd read everything that had been written about him to that point.\n\n\"Where one ends up is, as [the then prime minister] Tony Blair said in 1997, those who governed in London at the time of the Irish famine failed their people by standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy.\n\n\"He [Sir Charles] was the Treasury official in charge of the famine relief so he is an absolutely central character in this and as I reflected in my book in 2006, he's a providentialist, he's a laissez-faire economist. He feels that private charity in Ireland should be leaping to the rescue.\n\n\"It is hard to interpret his writings in some ways because they're so Victorian and convoluted and open to interpretation in some ways. But he both says the people cannot under any circumstances be allowed to starve - and they do starve, so he's failed by his own point.\n\n\"And he also seems to suggest that in some ways this is the divine punishment of God for a one-crop economy. It's very hard to defend any of it.\"\n\nIn her book, she said there was a debate over the extent of the role played by Sir Charles, with some historians being more critical than others, and at least one defending him.\n\nDetail from an illustration depicting a scene outside a 19th century workhouse during the Irish famine\n\nAs for the song, The Fields Of Athenry, it has become very familiar to Ms Trevelyan.\n\nWritten by Pete St John, it has grown in popularity in recent years and is often sung at Irish sporting occasions, including by fans supporting the Ireland rugby team.\n\n\"It's been sung to me many a time,\" Ms Trevelyan said.\n\n\"I was once trying to park a car outside the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Dublin and somebody came and helped me get into the spot.

Mr Netanyahu says the changes will \"rebalance\" the branches of government.\n\nThe proposals would give ministers near full control over the committee which appoints judges and would ultimately strip the Supreme Court of crucial powers to strike down legislation.\n\n\"Our democracy is literally under attack by the government,\" said demonstrator Avinoam Brog.\n\n\"My parents' generation was part of the foundation of the country.

On top is a powerful machine gun. Inside, a large screen displays multiple live video feeds of the battlefield from hundreds of drones.\n\nLook up Gen Syrskyi online and you will see him described as \"the most successful general of the 21st Century so far\".\n\nIt's a lot to live up to.\n\nHe led the defence of Kyiv at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. He was the mastermind behind Ukraine's surprise and successful counter-attack in Kharkiv last summer. Now, he's head of military operations in eastern Ukraine - one of the two main axes in Ukraine's counter-offensive.\n\nWe watch a feed of the heavily shell-scarred fields around Bakhmut, where some of his troops are trying to take back ground. I ask him if it's his goal to recapture the city? He smiles and says: \"Yes, of course. I try to do it.\"\n\nBut even he admits that, more than a month since it started, Ukraine's long-awaited offensive on multiple fronts is going slower than many had hoped.\n\nHe says in the east, just like the south, the area is saturated with mines and defensive barriers. The Russians, he says, have many strongholds: \"Therefore, our advances are really not going as fast as we would like.\"\n\nWe'd like to get very fast results. But in reality it's practically impossible\n\nBut Gen Syrskyi believes Ukraine still has one distinct advantage.\n\n\"I believe the unity of our military leadership and our soldiers' trust in each other is a strong point of our army.\"\n\nThat's in stark contrast to Russia's military hierarchy, which appears to be suffering from infighting, with senior officers being removed from command.\n\nGen Syrskyi is lionised by those around him, who admire his commitment, determination and cunning. Relaxation is a daily session in the gym. He sleeps for just four-and-a-half hours a night.\n\nTo the south and north of Bakhmut, Ukraine says it has retaken nearly 30 sq km (about 12 sq miles) of territory from the Russians.\n\nFor him recapturing Bakhmut is also \"a matter of honour\": \"We lost many of our brothers, our servicemen, when we were defending Bakhmut\u2026 therefore we simply have to return it.\"\n\nUkraine's deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, told us that Russian forces in the city would soon be trapped. But artillery shells were still raining down on one Ukrainian position we visited just 3km from the city.\n\nAlex, one of the soldiers from Ukraine's 57th Brigade, describes the situation as \"tense\".\n\nHe points to a large crater created by a Russian artillery shell from earlier that morning. It landed just a few metres from his trench.\n\nShortly after, we too had to run for cover.\n\nFar away from the shelling, commanders in a deep bunker are co-ordinating the efforts to recapture Bakhmut.\n\nTwo months ago, when I was last here, Ukraine was losing ground and in danger of being encircled. Now, the tables have turned.\n\nCol Oleksandr Bakulin, commander of the 57th Brigade, tells me it's now the Russians who are in trouble.\n\nHe says he doesn't underestimate his enemy, but that the regular Russian troops he now faces are not like Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner mercenaries who eventually captured the city earlier this year.\n\nWagner, he says, \"were uncomfortable enemies\u2026 they were killing for the sake of killing\".\n\n\"If we put in a bit of effort, Bakhmut could be encircled,\" Col Bakulin says. Contrary to conventional military wisdom, he also says his casualties in the offensive are fewer than when his unit was static, defending the city.\n\nMoving forward, albeit slowly, he says has also boosted morale so \"the losses are easier to bear\".\n\nFor the first time on the eastern front, the numbers of Ukrainian forces now match those of Russian troops - about 160,000. However, Ukraine is still outgunned by Russian artillery.\n\nM777 howitzers, supplied by the US, are already in position around Bakhmut\n\nCould the dynamics change with the arrival of US-supplied cluster munitions, which contain dozens of small bombs that can be sprayed out over a wider area? More than a hundred countries have banned them.\n\nCol Bakulin says they're needed to \"inflict maximum damage on enemy infantry\". \"The more infantry who die here, the more their relatives back in Russia will ask their government 'why?'\"\n\nBut, he adds: \"I can't say that cluster bombs will solve all our problems on the battlefield.\"\n\nHe also acknowledges they're a controversial weapon: \"If the Russians didn't use them, perhaps conscience would not allow us to do it too.\"\n\nGen Syrskyi confirmed that US cluster munitions had now arrived in Ukraine and would be ready to use within days. We saw the US-supplied M777 howitzers, which will fire the shells, already in position around Bakhmut.\n\nThe general says the city's recapture would have more than just symbolic value. He argues Bakhmut is also of strategic importance - as the gateway to other key cities in the region.\n\nBut, he says: \"Our people wait for victories. They need small victories.\"", "Fentanyl trafficking has surged in the US in recent years\n\nThe Mexican president says his country has proof that illegal shipments of the powerful opioid drug fentanyl are arriving from China.\n\nA container with hidden packages of the drug was intercepted in the Pacific port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\n\"We already have proof,\" he said, adding that he would ask the Chinese government to help stop the shipments.\n\nUS authorities say fentanyl is now the main driver of US drug overdose deaths.\n\nIn March President L\u00f3pez Obrador said he had written to Chinese President Xi Jinping requesting Chinese help in the anti-narcotics fight, after US politicians had urged him to do so.\n\nHe told reporters on Friday that he would repeat that plea to Beijing: \"In a very respectful manner, we are going to send this information to reiterate the request that they help us.\"\n\nMexican Navy Secretary Rafael Ojeda said the container intercepted in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas had packages weighing 34-35kg (75 pounds) with traces of fentanyl and methamphetamine hidden in fuel resin. The cargo had left the Chinese city of Qingdao and passed through Busan in South Korea before reaching Mexico.\n\nFentanyl is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. The US Drug Enforcement Administration says 67% of the 107,375 US deaths from drug overdoses or poisonings in 2021 were linked to fentanyl or similar opioids. Fentanyl is linked to more deaths of Americans under 50 than any other cause, the DEA says.\n\nThe US authorities blame Mexican drug gangs for supplying fentanyl to users across the US. Last month three sons of drugs kingpin \"El Chapo\" - members of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel - were charged in the United States with fentanyl trafficking, but only one of them is in custody. Their father Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence in the US.\n\nPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador has said fentanyl is not produced in Mexico but bought by the drugs gangs from suppliers in Asia.\n\nLast month Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said \"there is no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between China and Mexico\".\n\n\"China has not been notified by Mexico on the seizure of scheduled fentanyl precursors from China,\" she said. Drugs listed in schedules are subject to various official restrictions.\n\nMao Ning said the widespread fentanyl abuse in the US was a problem \"completely 'made in USA'\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

What's wrong?\"\n\nBevan waited another hour before calling an ambulance.\n\nThe court heard that when paramedics arrived at the home, they found Lola lying unconscious with a swollen and bruised face, and she also appeared to be wet.\n\nInvestigators later noticed that the bath was spotlessly clean despite the rest of the house being dirty.\n\nA vomit and blood-stained grey onesie was also found in the corner of the living room.\n\nThe prosecutor said it is believed all that was part of Kyle Bevan's attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nProsecutor Caroline Rees KC told the court: \"We say that, rather than face up to what he did to the little girl, Kyle Bevan immediately tried to save himself.\n\n\"Rather than immediately call the emergency services, as surely would be natural had this been an accident as he now says, he took time to concoct excuses and lies.\"\n\nLola's mother Sinead James was found guilty of causing or allowing her daughter's death\n\nJurors were shown photographs that Bevan took of Lola's injuries and a video he shot of her unconscious and badly injured.\n\nIn the video, a topless Bevan is seen lifting an unresponsive Lola and trying to stand her up.\n\nHe then lets her go and a thud can be heard as she falls to the ground.\n\nBevan then places Lola back on the sofa where she can be heard snoring, and he walks towards the camera saying: \"She's gone. She's gone.\"\n\nSinead James claimed she was asleep when her daughter's injuries were caused, which was accepted by the prosecution.\n\nBut they said James should have been aware of the threat Bevan posed to Lola due to previous violent incidents against her.\n\nJames told the court she was woken by Bevan at 07:20 on 17 July, who told her Lola had fallen down the stairs.\n\nShe told the court she rushed to see her daughter and saw Lola on the sofa with a swollen head and lips.\n\nLola had previously suffered a series of injuries in the months leading up to her death including a bloodied nose, a grazed chin and a split lip.\n\nAll of these were covered up by Bevan with a string of excuses, but the jury ruled they should have made James realise that Bevan was a threat to Lola.\n\nBevan told police Lola had been pushed down the stairs by the dog\n\nJames had a domestic violence advisor, to whom James never disclosed that Bevan had moved into the family home.\n\nJames broke down in tears when the verdict was read out that she was found guilty of causing or allowing her daughter's death.\n\nBevan did not react when he was found guilty of Lola's murder.\n\nAfter the trial, Lola's grandmother Nicola James said in a statement: \"My last memory with Lola is hearing her singing the song Diamonds by Rihanna.\n\n\"She will forever be our diamond up in the sky, we will never ever forget her, and we will continue to keep her memory alive.\n\n\"As a family we will never get over this, the loss that we feel is indescribable.\"\n\nSinead James claimed she was asleep when her daughter's injuries were caused, which was accepted by the prosecution\n\nLola's father Daniel Thomas said the pain and grief he felt was \"unbearable\".\n\n\"The pain I feel thinking of all the smiles you gave to me and all the smiles I won't get a chance to give back to you hurts so much.\n\n\"Even to say your name shatters my heart to know you can't hear my voice anymore.\n\n\"The only reason I can stand here today is for hope that you can see me, see that you were loved and that you deserved to live a full, happy, safe life surrounded by the joy that you gave to others.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry your short life was filled with so much pain. You are so loved Lola and so missed every single day.\"\n\nNSPCC Cymru's assistant director Tracey Holdsworth said a review into Lola's death must establish whether more could have been done by agencies to save her.\n\n\"It's crucial this leads to systemic changes that ensure children like Lola are better protected,\" she said.\n\nBevan and James will be sentenced on 25 April.", "Yoghurt manufacturer M\u00fcller has donated \u00a3100,000 to a wildlife charity after high levels of ammonia were discharged into a river near its dairy facility.\n\nThe Environment Agency (EA) said large pieces of fruit had passed into the factory's effluent treatment plant in Market Drayton, Shropshire, in 2018.\n\nAs a result, high levels of ammonia went into the River Tern and stayed above permitted amounts for 15 days.\n\nThe EA said M\u00fcller had since complied with regulations.\n\nIt added that as well as its payment to Shropshire Wildlife Trust, the manufacturer had also spent \u00a32m improving its environmental practices.\n\nM\u00fcller is the country's largest yoghurt producer and uses Market Drayton as its headquarters.\n\nContamination in the River Tern remained above permitted levels for 15 days\n\nThe EA said the discharge in January 2018 had marked a failure to comply with its permit conditions.\n\nIt happened during maintenance works, when pieces of fruit were inadvertently allowed to enter the effluent treatment plant.\n\nA spokesperson for M\u00fcller said there was \"no evidence of environmental harm\".

The province is still battling 127 fires as of Friday\n\nQuebec has made progress in its battle to fight wildfires that have contributed to the smoke that blanketed large parts of North America this week.\n\n\"We're really happy with the last 48 hours,\" said Philippe Bergeron, with Quebec's firefighting agency, on Friday.\n\nSome evacuees in the province are hopeful they can soon return home.\n\nCanada is currently battling more than 400 wildfires burning across the country.\n\nMr Bergeron said that firefighters have been successful in putting out a few fires, as well as containing larger ones in the province that have not grown as much in the last few days.\n\nOn Friday, Quebec said it had allocated C$1,500 ($1,120; \u00a3890) for every household that had been forced to evacuate in the province because of the fires.\n\nBut despite improvements in that province, on the west coast, officials in British Columbia (BC) are warning of a \"wild\" fire season ahead.\n\nOn Thursday, residents of the town of Tumbler Ridge, in north-eastern BC, were ordered to evacuated due to a rapidly growing fire nearby.\n\nIn Quebec, where about 120 fires are currently burning, residents from Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou told the BBC that they are getting regular updates about the fire threatening their Cree community.\n\nOuj\u00e9-Bougoumou evacuees have been sheltering in local colleges in the city of Saguenay, around 392km (243 miles) southwest of their community.\n\nSeveral fires are also threatening other nearby indigenous communities, like Chibougamau, which has also been evacuated.\n\nLance Cooper, the deputy chief of Ouj\u00e9-Bougoumou, said his town of some 650 people had to evacuate quickly as thick clouds of smoke and flames encroached on Tuesday.\n\nHe said when evacuation efforts began, the town was focused on getting its most vulnerable people out, like the elderly and people with respiratory issues, due to concerns about air quality.\n\nBut within hours, they received a call from Quebec's firefighting agency warning the situation had grown more dangerous.\n\n\"They had told us that everybody must go,\" Mr Cooper told the BBC.\n\nThey cleared the community very quickly after that, he said.\n\nWildfire smoke filled the skies of Ouje-Bougoumou on Tuesday, hours before the entire community was forced to evacuate.\n\nMr Cooper said that by the time he left, on the only highway out of town, what would have been a two-hour trip turned into a six-hour journey, with cars of evacuees from the region driving bumper-to-bumper .\n\nHe said his community's evacuees have been welcomed in Saguenay, a city of 145,000 people, where they have spent the past few days at makeshift shelters set up in local colleges, sleeping on military beds.\n\nBut they are well taken care of, he said and the Cree community has been organising activities for the evacuated youth, like paintball games and movie nights.\n\n\"It's like we're on a camping trip,\" Mr Cooper joked.\n\nBut he said the situation has been scary for the community, who has never been forced to evacuate due to wildfires before.\n\nPeople are hopeful that their homes will be spared, he said.\n\nSome communities across Canada have already lost homes as a result of this year's devastating wildfire season.\n\nIn Alberta, around 85 structures have been destroyed on the Little Red Cree Nation, a spokesperson told Global News.\n\nAt least another 150 homes were destroyed in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, local authorities had said.\n\nCanada is relying on the help of firefighters from around the world, who have come to battle the unprecedented wildfire season.\n\nJust over 100 arrived from France to Quebec on Thursday and they will be deployed on the ground by Saturday.\n\nThe unusual scale and number of fires this season have raised questions in Canada on whether the country needs to bolster its firefighting ability to grapple what the government has said is the result of climate change.\n\nMr Cooper said his community is already reckoning with a warming climate around them.\n\n\"I think we're gonna probably see more and more of these fires down the road,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully many of us will be spared from ever having to experience our homes burning.\"", "Gwynedd has the highest number second homes in Wales, and the council cabinet wants to \"control\" this\n\nSecond home owners in part of north Wales could have to seek planning permission.\n\nDafydd Meurig, the Gwynedd council cabinet member for environment, said second homes were \"immoral\" during a \"huge housing crisis\".\n\nCouncillors voted on Tuesday afternoon to proceed with a move to \"control the numbers\".\n\nBut there are claims of \"anti-English\" messaging and suggestions housebuilding should be the focus.\n\nNorth Wales Tourism said Gwynedd council was a \"rich authority\" which should be building more houses.\n\nWelsh government amendments to planning regulations have introduced three new classes of use: main home, second home and short-term holiday accommodation.\n\nCouncils also now have the power to control the use of houses as second homes or holiday lets.\n\nUnder the proposal, people wanting to use their property for one of those purposes would need permission.\n\nIt has been backed by cabinet members, so a public consultation will now be held, and a final decision made next year.\n\nMr Meurig said Gwynedd had about 8,000 second homes, while 3,600 people were on waiting lists for social housing and 150 residents were presenting as homeless every month.\n\n\"I think as long as people don't have a single home, then a second home is immoral in my view,\" he said.\n\n\"There are people who are homeless, who don't have somewhere to live in their own area, and somebody has a second home that they can use part of the year. I think that is certainly a problem.\"\n\nMr Meurig said people in Gwynedd were living in temporary hotel accommodation, paid for by the council, while others were \"coming on holiday into houses\".\n\nThe move comes just months after Gwynedd Council voted to increase taxes for second home owners, which means they now pay a 250% council tax rate.\n\nJim Jones, of North Wales Tourism, said \"ineffective policies\" were not the way forward.\n\n\"We urge the council to build new homes for local people, because after all, Gwynedd council is a rich authority with huge reserves,\" he said.\n\nHe said self-catering accommodation was the \"bread and butter of Gwynedd's economy\" and the new policy would encourage people to \"sell up\".\n\n\"They won't sell to local people, they'll sell to the highest bidder,\" he said.\n\n\"I think all these policies that are ongoing at the moment seem to be very anti-tourism.\"\n\nMr Meurig added: \"Where's the money coming from to buy houses or to build houses? The council has a \u00a377 million housing action plan to build houses and to make houses available, but that is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the problem that second homes bring.\"\n\nJanet Finch Saunders, Welsh Conservative shadow minister for climate change said it was a \"shocking decision\" from the Plaid Cymru-run council, which \"smacks of nationalism at its worst\".\n\nShe said people from England had told her they felt such policies were \"anti-English\".\n\nShe added: \"If you look back in history, people have come on holiday to Wales, fallen in love with it and then they've wanted to move here, and why shouldn't they? We are a free country.\n\n\"I think it's a barmy idea and to be honest I think it could be challengeable in law.\"\n\nPaul Gill, from Cheshire, who bought a second home in Abersoch with his wife 40 years ago, said he did not believe the council's policies would result in \"any great change in the housing market here\".\n\nGwynedd council said planning permission would not be needed to turn a second home or short-term let into a primary residence.\n\nBut Mr Gill said the planning process could deter buyers, and delay potential house sales by months.\n\n\"Purchasers don't wait weeks. They go away, they find something else. It's half-baked and it won't work,\" he said.\n\nBusiness owner Griff Owen, who runs chalets, a cafe, beach huts and a car park in Abersoch, said: \"If it gets harder for second home owners, they're going to move somewhere else.\n\n\"If you drive tourism away there'll be nothing left here for people.\"\n\nHe said second home owners employed cleaners, builders, gardeners and other services, adding: \"There's nothing much here besides the view, the beaches and the mountains and you can't live off views.\n\n\"Without money coming in, how do you pay the bills?\"\n\nHowever, Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith welcomed the proposal.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"This is an extremely important first step and we really hope that more planning authorities will follow suit in due course, because time is short.\n\n\"The recent results of the census clearly show that our Welsh-speaking communities are under siege.\"\n\nThe report which was discussed on Tuesday defined short-term letting accommodation as use of a property for holiday accommodation, with fewer than 30 days per occupation. Meanwhile, second home ownership was defined as use of a property \"other than as a sole or main residence, occupied for 183 days or less\" per year.", "Daisy Goodwin also spoke out about the alleged assault in 2017 but did not name anyone\n\nDaisy Goodwin has complained formally to the Cabinet Office about Tory London mayoral hopeful Daniel Korski.\n\nOn Monday, novelist and TV producer Ms Goodwin said he had groped her during a meeting at 10 Downing Street in 2013.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said she had not reported the matter at the time because of the attitudes of the day.\n\nMr Korski \"categorically denies\" her allegations and says he is still in the race to become a mayoral candidate.\n\nMs Goodwin, 61, told Today's Martha Kearney: \"I didn't think to report it then because I felt, 'Well, this is part of the rough and tumble of daily life', and I feel now when I speak out most people believe me.\"\n\nShe said she believed attitudes had \"completely changed\" in the decade since her encounter with Mr Korski.\n\nDaniel Korski says he is still in the race to become the Conservative mayoral candidate for London\n\nThe writer and TV producer, who was behind the successful ITV drama Victoria, explained she had faced difficulty trying to make her formal complaint to the Cabinet Office on Tuesday, struggling to get 10 Downing Street's switchboard to put her through to anyone on the phone.\n\nShe said she had not complained to the Conservative Party but was happy to do so, adding she felt \"entirely justified\" in naming Mr Korski, 46, due to his mayoral ambitions.\n\nWhen she was asked by Ms Kearney whether she was sure about the alleged assault, she replied: \"I'm really surprised you're asking me that. \"When something like this happens to you, you know it's happened to you because you were there, you felt it, you felt amazed, shocked, rather humiliated.\"\n\nIn her article in the Times, Ms Goodwin said that Mr Korski - then a special adviser at 10 Downing Street - had put his hand on her breast.\n\nMs Goodwin said that since the article's publication other women had contacted her with \"interesting stories\", but added she could not provide details for legal reasons.\n\nIn an interview with TalkTV on Tuesday, Mr Korski was asked about the possibility of further accusations, replying: \"To the best of my knowledge, absolutely, I don't expect anybody to come out and say anything.\"\n\nDowning Street described the claims against Mr Korski as \"very serious\".\n\nAsked if the prime minister would encourage anyone with complaints against former staff members to come forward, a spokeswoman said: \"Yes, of course.\"\n\nShe added: \"The two parties are telling different stories; the proper processes should be followed and conclusions shouldn't be drawn until the processes are followed through.\"\n\nBorn in Denmark, he is the son of Polish emigres.\n\nHe was deputy head of the Number 10 policy unit between 2013 and 2016.\n\nA campaigner to stay in the EU, he left Number 10 when David Cameron did after the Brexit referendum. He has previously worked for a think tank and as a journalist.\n\nHe is a technology entrepreneur, having set up his own business providing support for companies seeking contracts in the public sector.\n\nThe central message of his campaign to be the Conservatives' mayoral candidate is enabling people to achieve the \"London dream\".\n\nHis key offer is the pledge to provide new solutions to old problems, such as pay-per-mile road-pricing to tackle congestion and air pollution in the capital.\n\nMr Korksi's campaign team said he welcomed any investigation and would co-operate fully.\n\nDuring his TalkTV interview, Mr Korski said \"all I can say is that she is wrong\". He agreed that a meeting had taken place but dismissed the groping allegation as \"categorically\" untrue.\n\nMr Korski said: \"All I can say is that I've always tried to comport myself with the utmost respect when I've been positions of leadership; I've sought to create the kind of empowering, diverse environment where everyone can feel safe and can grow in their jobs.\"\n\nSome Tory MP backers of Mr Korski have paused their support for his campaign.\n\nOne of them, children and families minister Claire Coutinho, said any complaint should be investigated \"swiftly\".\n\n\"At the same time, this is an allegation.

Police bodycam captured the Tasering and arrest of triple murderer Saju Chelavelel\n\nA father who strangled his wife and two children has been jailed for at least 40 years.\n\nNurse Anju Asok, 35, Jeeva Saju, six, and Janvi Saju, four, were found fatally injured in the family home in Kettering on 15 December 2022.\n\nA judge told Saju Chelavalel he had \"squeezed the life out\" of his wife while the children screamed for mummy.\n\nDet Insp Simon Barnes said: \"There is no amount of time behind bars that will ever be enough for what he did.\"\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, jailed him for life at Northampton Crown Court, and ordered that he must serve a minimum of 40 years.\n\nThe bodies of Anju Asok, her son Jeeva Saju and daughter Janvi Saju were discovered after police forced entry into their home in Kettering\n\nOriginally from Kerala in India, Chelavalel said he believed his wife was having an affair and claimed he lost control while drunk, killing her at around 22:00 GMT on 14 December at their ground-floor flat.\n\nThe court heard Chelavalel had more than four hours \"to reflect on whether to kill his children\" before using a dressing gown cord to strangle them in the early hours of the following morning.\n\nMs Asok died at the scene and the children died later in hospital.\n\nPost-mortem examinations found all three victims died from asphyxiation, Northamptonshire Police said.\n\n\"While you were squeezing the life out of your wife, your young children were screaming for their mummy,\" said the judge.\n\n\"I cannot be sure if they were eyewitnesses, but it is clear that they heard what was going on and knew that she was being hurt by you.\"\n\nSaju Chelavalel, 52, admitted to the triple murder of his wife and children\n\nProsecutor James Newton-Price KC said there was no evidence to support the claim Ms Asok had been unfaithful.\n\nHowever, an examination of Chelavalel's phone showed that he had been searching dating websites for other women while she was at work.\n\nThe court was played an audio recording found on his phone of banging noises followed by the sound of a woman screaming or gasping and a child crying or calling out.\n\nMr Newton-Price said it was the prosecution's belief that it was a recording of Ms Asok being strangled.\n\nHe said the it also captured the sound of a blender being used to make a \"toxic\" mixture of chocolate and pills intended to send the children - pupils at Kettering Park Infant Academy - to sleep.\n\nThe court heard that police officers attended the flat after receiving a call from a neighbour who was concerned for the family's welfare.\n\nMs Asok had failed to turn up for work as an orthopaedic nurse at Kettering General Hospital and the children were not at school.\n\nBody-worn camera footage showed that, after breaking into the flat, officers found Chelavalel holding a knife to his throat. He asked the police to shoot him and said that he wanted to die, before he was Tasered.\n\nThe body of Ms Asok was found on the floor of an adjoining bedroom. The couple's children were described in a police statement as \"laying perfectly side-by-side on the double bed\".\n\nOffering mitigation, defence barrister George Carter-Stephenson KC said the circumstances of the case were tragic in the extreme for relatives of the victims.\n\nHe said: \"They are also tragic for this particular defendant. Whatever sentence the court imposes on him today he has to live with the knowledge of what he did on that particular night.\"\n\nIn addition to his jail term, Chelavalel was prohibited from contacting any of his victims' family members.\n\nDet Insp Simon Barnes from Northamptonshire Police said: \"Anju was a mother like many all over the world. She wanted to provide the best possible life she could for her children - Jeeva and Janvi.\n\n\"He [Chelavalel] has never fully accounted for what he did, or why, and will now spend the rest of his life with not much else to think about, but that.\n\n\"There is no amount of time behind bars that will ever be enough for what he did. His primary role as a husband and a father, was to protect his family from harm. They should have been at their safest, at home, with him, but he destroyed that.\n\n\"They leave behind them a devastated family in India, who are struggling to come to terms with what has happened.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

It added it was reflective of the entire rental market which currently has a pool of 2.75 million landlords.\n\nAge was the dominant reason for the exodus, but lower-than-average returns on investments, the general economy, tax and regulatory changes were also to blame, it said.\n\nResearcher Aneisha Beveridge said this \"combination of everything\" meant older landlords had simply had enough.\n\nWhile rents for new tenants were relatively high, \"quite a high proportion\" of older landlords had long-term sitting tenants that achieved relatively low returns, Ms Beveridge said.\n\n\"But some are not selling up all of their properties, they're just selling one or two so they can afford a cruise or time on the golf course or to be able to help their families,\" she added.\n\nThe research found about 96,000 landlords will turn 65 each coming year across Great Britain.\n\nIt said this was in addition to the 924,000 who were already over the age of 65, and that between 2010 and 2022 the number of landlords retiring annually had doubled.\n\nThe agency found London was most affected as many of the first buy-to-let mortgages were used for new, low-rise city centre flats - the highest proportion of properties being sold by long-term landlords.\n\nHamptons also noted the departing landlords left a gap in the sector that was not being filled by a new generation of investors.\n\n\"The numbers don't stack up,\" Ms Beveridge said. \"Look at how the demographics have changed for younger people struggling to afford to own their own home, let alone a buy-to-let.\"\n\nThe agency said while house price growth continued to slow, rents were still rising sharply.\n\nWhile there was a little more choice of rental properties this year compared with 2022, overall the number of rental homes on the market seemed to have found a \"new normal\" at nearly two-thirds below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nCampaign group Generation Rent, which works to raise awareness of the issues facing tenants, said \"we shouldn't be surprised\" by the trend of ageing landlords selling up.\n\nSpokesman Dan Wilson Craw said: \"For nearly the past three decades the government has relied on amateurs saving for retirement to provide a large proportion of the nation's homes.\n\n\"The real problem is the chronic failure to build enough homes in places where people want to live.\"", "Listeria has been linked to batches of the soft cheese Baronet\n\nOne person has died in a listeria outbreak and people have been warned to avoid Baronet semi-soft cheeses which were recalled as they were contaminated with a related strain of the bacteria.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned people not to eat the cheeses as they contained high levels of the bacteria.\n\nThe FSA has not confirmed The Old Cheese Room, in Wiltshire, which makes the cheeses, was the source.\n\nThe firm said it was working \"closely\" with the FSA.\n\nThere have been three cases of listeria linked to the outbreak, resulting in the death of one person, the FSA confirmed.\n\nSeveral batches of Baronet, Baby Baronet and Mini Baronet soft cheeses made by the Old Cheese Room have been recalled.\n\nThe agency is continuing to investigate whether the person who died had eaten Baronet cheese.\n\nCases were identified in the south of England and London, but the product is distributed nationally.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause mild symptoms like stomach ache but can cause more serious complications\n\nTina Potter, the FSA's head of incidents, said: \"A closely genetically related strain of listeria monocytogenes found in samples of Baronet cheese, was found in all three cases in this outbreak.\n\n\"However, that does not necessarily mean that all those involved in the outbreak contracted listeriosis as a result of eating Baronet cheese.\n\n\"Although a source of listeria has been found in cheese products, work to ascertain the cause of the outbreak is continuing.\"\n\nThe agency said the outbreak strain has also been found in some food products and samples taken from other places where the cheese has been sold, supplied and served from.\n\nThe bacteria can cause listeriosis, a rare infection that usually goes away on its own, but can have serious complications including causing meningitis.\n\nSymptoms can be similar to flu and include a high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea.\n\nThe Old Cheese Room said that none of its other cheeses have been affected by the outbreak.\n\n\"As a responsible cheesemaker we carry out regular cleaning, disinfecting and swab testing of our making and ripening rooms,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"Since the test that showed a trace of listeria monocytogenes in a single batch of Baronet, we have changed our monthly testing regime to positive release - this means that we test every batch of cheese before it leaves us.\n\n\"None of our other cheeses have been affected by this.\"\n\nMs Potter said vulnerable people should be particularly concerned with following the product recall advice, including pregnant women and the elderly.\n\nGuidance issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said Baronet cheese is sold in both small individual rounds and as 1kg wheels.\n\n\"The cheeses are sometimes served sliced from a deli counter, so it may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.\n\n\"If in doubt, consumers are advised to contact the retailer they bought their cheese from to find out if the Baronet cheese they have purchased is from the batches affected and in the meantime to not eat the product,\" the guidance states.\n\nRichard Elson, UKHSA head of incidents and response, said: \"Listeriosis is a rare infection and most people will only experience mild symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhoea, which usually pass within a few days without the need for treatment.\n\n\"But people with weakened immune systems, who are pregnant, or are infants or elderly are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.\"\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He expected Good Friday traffic to slow down in the evening.\n\nCandice Mason, founder of Masons Coaches, told the BBC she hoped extra measures at Dover would be put in place for the rest of the peak season, not just the bank holiday weekend.\n\n\"We need to see this all through the summer season,\" she said, adding that last week's delays were caused by changes in the infrastructure at the port.\n\n\"We need to have our passports checked more rigorously, and there are different checks that are taking place - and really simply, last weekend in my opinion, it just wasn't staffed sufficiently,\" she said.\n\nPort officials said they held an \"urgent review\" with ferry operators and French authorities after last week's travel problems triggered a row over the impact of Brexit on the route.\n\nSlow processing of documentation since the UK left the EU, staffing levels on the French side of the Channel, and more coaches than expected were variously blamed for long queues at the port.\n\nFrench border police blamed the Port of Dover management for the congestion last weekend, claiming they had warned the UK side that too much traffic was being allowed through.\n\nThey insisted they had manned every booth on their side \"100% of the time\".\n\nA spokesperson for the French Police Nationale told the BBC it was \"mathematically impossible to absorb\" the amount of vehicles they were told needed processing.\n\nThe queues had been building inside the Port - but the mood among passengers on Friday morning was one of relief that they were not seeing the chaos the terminal experienced last week.\n\nBut there was still some trepidation as they inched towards border controls. Many arrived with plenty of food, drink and entertainment in case they do get stuck.\n\nThe police were out in force on the roads leading to the port, regulating the flow of traffic inside, which seemed to prevent the gridlock the town suffered last Saturday.\n\nThe authorities are convinced they are better prepared than last weekend.\n\nThe UK is expected to see settled weather for most of the Easter weekend\n\nThe weather is not expected to lead to travel woes over the weekend, with conditions forecast to remain largely dry until Monday.\n\nGemma Plumb, BBC Weather Forecaster, said Friday would be \"dry and fine for most of the UK with sunshine\", although there would be cloud in some eastern parts of the country.\n\nMost of the sunshine over the weekend is expected in western parts, before rain hits some parts of the country on Monday.\n\nThe AA, the British motoring association, said it expected Saturday to be the busiest day on the country's roads, with about 15 million drivers planning to use their cars. The RAC said it expected Friday and Sunday to be the busiest days, but there was \"always the chance of a boost in traffic if the weather forecast turns out better than expected\".\n\nCongestion is expected on the M25, the M4 Wales heading into Newport, the M6/M5 interchange in Birmingham as well as the M4/M5 in Bristol.\n\nTony Rich, from the AA, urged drivers to conduct checks on their cars before they travel, saying many of the callouts it gets were \"easily preventable\".\n\n\"We've put more patrols on duty, but drivers can help themselves and everyone else by doing the simple checks as breakdowns cause traffic jams,\" he said.\n\nPassengers headed to St Pancras to head out of the capital after London Euston closed for engineering work\n\nThe disruption has also extended to the country's railways, with some engineering work planned over the weekend, including at London's Euston Station - one of London's main rail hubs - which will be closed from Friday until Monday due to planned upgrades.\n\nAt St Pancras station in London, Sophie Earish, a student from Wembley Park, said the queues to get on trains were chaotic and writer Ruaridh Pritchard described the situation as \"mayhem\".\n\nHe said staff were doing their best \"under the circumstances\" but added that with \"lots of people arguing and pushing - it was like the last train out of Saigon\".\n\nAre you at Dover?

A private rescue deal eventually saw the Virgin Group inject \u00a3200m, with an additional \u00a31bn provided by investors and creditors.\n\n\"There was a time when I thought we were going to lose everything,\" Sir Richard said. \"We sold shares in companies that were public and that was one way we managed to find money.\"\n\nSir Richard, pictured with burlesque artist Dita Von Teese in 2010, said people would feel \"uncomfortable\" with such photoshoots today\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan, Sir Richard also discussed his marketing campaigns and publicity stunts of the past - often involving glamorous women, who he sometimes threw over his shoulder.\n\nAsked if those stunts now made him wince, he replied: \"It would make me wince if I felt the women were uncomfortable at all.\n\n\"I don't think that I ever made anybody feel uncomfortable. In those days, it made them smile... But today obviously, I think people would feel uncomfortable with something like that.\n\n\"So it's changed and I fully accept that. And I've changed alongside everybody else.\"\n\nSir Richard Branson travelled to space in 2021 in his Virgin Galactic commercial space plane\n\nIn 2021, Sir Richard achieved a lifelong ambition and reached the edge of space in his Virgin Galactic commercial space plane. \"It was one of those most extraordinary days, every aspect of it\", he said.\n\nHe defended space exploration as a worthwhile investment, when asked whether launching rockets should be a priority for the ultra-rich, or is compatible with tackling climate change - a cause to which he has devoted extensive effort and money.\n\n\"Communication between people is being transformed because of space travel and satellites up there,\" he said. \"Monitoring things like the depredation of rainforests and illegal fishing... [there are] all these kinds of benefits that come from space travel.\"\n\nHowever, his satellite launch rocket company Virgin Orbit filed for bankruptcy in the US last month after failing to secure new investment.\n\nIn recent years, Sir Richard has also campaigned to promote awareness of dyslexia, a term rarely used and even less understood when he dropped out of school at 15. He revealed that, shortly after being sent to boarding school aged seven, he was beaten so badly - \"for being stupid\" - that he bled.\n\n\"It was... pretty horrendous in those days. And yes, as a dyslexic, I thought I must be stupid because they had never heard of [it]. The word dyslexic didn't exist.\"\n\nAs well as dyslexia, Sir Richard thinks he probably has attention deficit disorder, and acknowledged he does get bored easily.\n\nAt the age of 72, the businessman still heads the Virgin Group - but admitted he does have thoughts about succession planning.\n\n\"We have serious discussions as a family about how the company can transform hopefully thousands people's lives in the years to come and hopefully in the centuries to come,\" he said.\n\nThe entrepreneur with a rock star persona, Sir Richard Branson, tells Amol Rajan how he went from 60s hippy to global business icon, reshaping industries and ending up in space.\n\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on BBC2 at 7pm", "June Steenkamp, arriving at the prison, said she did not believe Oscar Pistorius had been rehabilitated\n\nThe mother of Reeva Steenkamp, the woman who was murdered by Oscar Pistorius, says she does not feel the former Paralympics star is remorseful.\n\nJune Steenkamp spoke as she arrived for a parole board hearing that is considering whether he be freed early.\n\nHe has so far served half of his 13-year sentence for murdering his girlfriend a decade ago.\n\nIf he is granted parole, Pistorius, now aged 36, could be released from jail within a matter of days.\n\nThe six-time Paralympic gold medallist has expressed his deep remorse for killing his girlfriend on Valentine's Day in 2013, but continues to maintain he shot her by mistake, believing she was a robber.\n\n\"I don't believe his story. I don't believe Oscar is remorseful\u2026 or rehabilitated,\" Mrs Steenkamp said on Friday morning.\n\nShe had said that it would be hard to see her daughter's killer again, but in the end he was not in the room when she appeared before the board. Pistorius will appear separately.\n\nThe hearing is taking place at Atteridgeville prison, a low-security facility in rolling fields just outside the city of Pretoria.\n\nThe former amputee sprinter recently met Barry Steenkamp, Reeva's father, as part of a mandatory process known as \"victim-offender dialogue\".\n\nBut the Steenkamps' lawyer, Tania Koen, said the couple still felt Pistorius had intended to kill their daughter - and her death was a life sentence for them.\n\n\"For them, it's 10 missed birthdays, it's 10 Mother's Days, Father's Days, Christmases - so time hasn't healed for them,\" she told reporters at the prison.\n\n\"They don't feel that he should be released,\" she said, adding that they expected a decision to be taken later on Friday.\n\nOscar Pistorius shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at their home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day 10 years ago\n\nPistorius was initially found guilty of culpable homicide, but on appeal by the prosecutor he was convicted of murder, on the grounds that he must have known his actions - shooting three times through a locked bathroom door in his Pretoria home - would lead to the death of whoever was on the other side.\n\n\"I think he's probably got an arguable case [for parole],\" said Mannie Witz, a defence attorney, who also noted that the Steenkamps could challenge a decision to grant Pistorius parole in court, potentially delaying his release for many months.\n\nThe televised trial of the man once dubbed \"the Blade Runner\", because of the ground-breaking prosthetic legs he wore in both Paralympic and Olympic track races, attracted huge global attention.\n\nSouth Africa's prosecution team sought to prove Pistorius was an angry, violent man, with an unhealthy obsession with guns, who killed his 30-year-old girlfriend in a late-night rage.\n\n\"I still think he just went berserk and shot her. I don't personally believe the story of him thinking there was an intruder,\" said Mark West, a photographer who worked with Ms Steenkamp during her early modelling career.\n\nThe parole board - a minimum of three people - will consider statements from Pistorius, the Steenkamps, and from a range of social workers and prison officials. They will look at his behaviour, his state of mind and the extent to which he has been rehabilitated.\n\nIf Pistorius fails to get parole at his first attempt or his release is challenged by the Steenkamps, he could still go to court to argue that having served more than half the sentence, South African law stipulates that he should be released under supervision.\n\nThis would be most likely at his uncle's home in Pretoria, pending the result of any review or appeal.", "At 19, Loonkiito had a longer life than most wild lions\n\nA wild male lion believed to be one of the world's oldest has died after being speared by herders, authorities in Kenya have said.\n\nLoonkiito, who was 19, died in Olkelunyiet village on Wednesday night after preying on livestock.\n\nConservation group Lion Guardians said he was \"the oldest male lion in our ecosystem and possibly in Africa\". Most lions live to around 13 in the wild.\n\nAlmost all lions live in Africa with a small population in India, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\nKenya Wildlife Service (KWS) spokesperson Paul Jinaro told the BBC the lion was old and frail and wandered into the village from the park in search of food.\n\nMr Jinaro could not confirm if he was the oldest lion in the country but noted he was \"very old\".\n\nThe Maasai-operated Lion Guardians group works to conserve the lion population in Amboseli National Park, and said the end of a drought was \"habitually marked by an uptick in human-lion conflict\" as \"wild prey recover and become more difficult to hunt\".\n\n\"In desperation, lions often turn to take livestock,\" it said.\n\nIt added the killing of Loonkiito was a \"tough situation for both sides, the people and the lion\", and eulogised him as \"a symbol of resilience and coexistence\".\n\nPaula Kahumbu, a wildlife conservationist and chief executive officer of WildlifeDirect, said she was pained by the killing of the lion and called for measures to protect wildlife in the country.\n\n\"This is the breaking point for human-wildlife conflict and we need to do more as a country to preserve lions, which are facing extinction,\" Ms Kahumbu told the BBC.\n\nThe average lifespan of a lion is about 13 years in the wild, although they can live much longer in captivity.", "Miranda Dickson was frustrated after an anonymous complaint about her off-white shade of pink\n\nAn Edinburgh woman who has faced a lengthy battle over the colour of her front door has won permission to keep its latest shade of pink.\n\nMiranda Dickson, 49, was ordered by city planners to change the colour last year after painting it bright pink.\n\nShe repainted it green - but after further complaints, it was changed again to an \"off-white\" shade of pink.\n\nThat colour also sparked a complaint, but has now received the approval from officials.\n\nIn a letter granting permission, City of Edinburgh Council said: \"The proposals have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building and its setting and will not adversely impact on its special architectural and historic interest.\n\n\"The proposals will preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area.\"\n\nMs Dickson first received an enforcement notice in September last year, which said the bright pink door on her Georgian townhouse did not meet the standards of a listed property in a World Heritage Site.\n\nIt stated she must repaint it to its original white colour or formally apply for planning permission.\n\nShe submitted a retrospective application after facing a \u00a320,000 fine if she did not change the colour.\n\nMs Dickson was ordered to repaint the bright shade of pink last year.\n\nMs Dickson repainted the door green, but this was also rejected by planners\n\nMs Dickson said at the time that she was confused about being ordered to change the colour scheme, as there were many other brightly coloured doors in Edinburgh's New Town.\n\nIn April, she painted the door green and applied for planning permission for this colour.\n\nThis was also rejected, so she painted it an off-white pink and applied again for planning permission - but another anonymous complaint was then made.\n\nHowever, this shade has now been officially approved by Edinburgh city council planners.\n\nMs Dickson's case made international headlines after it was covered by the BBC in October last year.\n\nShe said she was shocked by the enormous reaction to her pink door.\n\n\"I don't understand why it has caused them to be so angry, I can't understand that emotion about the colour of a door,\" she said.\n\n\"These homes were built as entertainment spaces.

They began just days after China's military rehearsed a blockade of Taiwan - a display the US called disproportionate. With tensions high in the region, a handful of people on a few small islands find themselves caught between two superpowers.\n\nThe steep limestone cliffs and rolling hills that make up this tiny island on the northern edge of the Philippines rise out of the Luzon Strait.\n\nEven on a good day, strong waves on the azure seas toss around tiny fishing boats hoping to hook some of the islanders' favourite flying fish.\n\nNearly 3,000 native Ivatans, fishermen and farmers, have survived here in the face of earthquakes, typhoons and drought. But now they face a new and different threat.\n\nTheir island home risks being caught in a conflict between the United States and China as the two militaries skirt ever closer to each other to gain the upper hand in the South China Sea.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is Taiwan. China's claims over the self-governing island are growing louder even as the US' commitment to defend it appears to be deepening.\n\nAnd these islands - Itbayat and Basco - that make up the far-flung Philippine archipelago of Batanes are in the line of crossfire.\n\nThey appear as mere dots in the ocean that surrounds them. But their proximity to Taiwan - it's just 156km (96 miles) from Itbayat - has made them both strategic allies and vulnerable foes.\n\nAnalysts often talk of rising tensions between the two superpowers, but what is it like to live in the biggest flashpoint between Beijing and Washington?\n\nItbayat can often be cut off for weeks. It certainly looks impenetrable. Small ports are carved out of the cliffs and getting to a boat involves clambering down steep steps cut into the rock face.\n\nThe colour of the water hugging the land is a deep turquoise - and so clear you can watch small fish play amongst the coral. Itbayat feels untouched by man, other than the indigenous community who've made it their home.\n\nFew here have televisions. A network of relayed messages from house to house, or through the church congregation is often more reliable than the patchy phone signal.\n\nBut they don't need TV news or social media to tell them about the turbulent relationship between the US and China which threatens their shores.\n\nIt's closer than it has ever been.\n\nCrouched down, eyes fixed through the viewfinders of their weapons and head to toe in camouflage are the members of the US Army's 25th Infantry Division training on the island of Basco.\n\nThey were practising to defend the island from potential aggressors. The exercise was part of the largest combat drills ever held between the US and the Philippines.\n\nOut at sea, the mission was controlled from the USS Miguel Keith, a naval ship, while V-22 Osprey aircraft hovered over the island, much to the amazement of locals who grabbed their mobile phones to film. The simulation even involved rocket launchers being shipped to the beaches using amphibious landing craft.\n\n\"The goal of our campaign in this region is to deter conflict from ever occurring,\" says Major General Joseph Ryan, the commanding general of the 25th Infantry Division.\n\n\"We don't want a war with the PRC [People's Republic of China]. We do not want that, we do not desire that and we are not provoking that. A war with the PRC is good for nobody.\"\n\nBut, he admits, the two forces are sending a message.\n\nThe US and Philippines are holding the largest ever joint military drills\n\n\"The message sent is we're ready, we're capable, we're prepared. We've got a great partnership here. And we mean business.\"\n\nThe two sides are certainly arming themselves; as is the whole of Asia.\n\nChina is still the region's biggest spender on new military hardware, with this year's defence budget the highest it's ever been, around $224bn.\n\nThe US, in turn, has been keen to show off its capabilities, holding ever more military drills with allies throughout the region, including Japan, South Korea and Australia.\n\nFor Washington this is not just about a display of shiny new arms. It is also about shoring up alliances - the White House has been dispatching envoys more often than usual to Asia, hoping to stitch together a sturdy coalition to counter China. And that includes the Philippines, whose location is an asset.\n\n\"The situation is heating up,\" admitted Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos in a recent interview with a local radio station ahead of his visit to Washington this week.\n\nHe has decided to take a more assertive approach to China than his predecessor and that includes ordering more patrols by the Navy and the Coastguard.\n\nBut what would be largely uneventful patrols elsewhere have the potential to turn into a conflict in the South China Sea, where even fishing could ignite a geopolitical crisis.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea - a strategic waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually - despite an international court ruling that the assertion has no legal basis.\n\n\"The Chinese fishermen used to harass us,\" says 59-year-old Cyrus Malupa, as he casts a single wire line with a metal hook into the sea.\n\n\"But when we reported that to the government, it placed a military base on Mavulis Island to the north. Now we have Philippine Marines there on duty,\" he adds.\n\nIn March, the Navy started a month-long mission on the uninhabited island, described it as the country's \"first line of defence\" and raised the Filipino flag on its highest peak. A small but bold act of sovereignty.\n\nFor Cyrus and others who live in tiny boats for days in the hope of catching enough tuna to sell at the local market, the geopolitical dispute is personal. It's about feeding their families.\n\nHundreds of Filipino fishermen have reported incidents of being driven away from their traditional fishing grounds in the South China Sea for more than a decade - particularly in the contested seas near the Spratly Islands.\n\n\"We don't have that much catch because the poachers have more advanced technology,\" Cyrus says as the tiny boat bounces over the white horses now forming on the water.\n\n\"Us locals use the old way of fishing like lines and smaller nets. But the poachers have more advanced technology so they can catch as much as they can.\"\n\nManila has filed nearly 200 diplomatic protests against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea - where Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping territorial claims.\n\nIt's natural to be worried because any conflict will affect our lives,\" said 51-year-old Victor Gonzales.\n\n\"First, we are afraid for our lives and then there is the possible exodus of people coming here from Taiwan as we have limited resources.\"\n\nLike most on Itbayat, Victor farms when the sea is rough and goes out to fish when it is fair. Crops are raised by hand, with no help from machinery or fertilisers. Instead, farmers rotate sweet potato, rice, corn, garlic and onions. A single farm can feed around 25 families.\n\n\"We need to protect our resources because it's how we live, and we don't have any alternative. We want to have something to pass onto the next generation,\" Victor says.\n\nThe concern runs deep enough that leaders of local governments in the Batanes islands announced to reporters last December that they would secure food supplies to prepare for a possible conflict.\n\nThe restricted signs around the Camilo Osias naval base on the beaches of Santa Ana are hand-painted and difficult to make out - almost obscured by the dozens of green fishing boats moored along the sand. It's Sunday and a few of the men who would usually be at sea are getting tipsy in the shade on a Filipino brand of gin.\n\nA handful of water buffalo wallow in the shallows flicking off the birds that come to rest on their backs with their tails. Nearby, women are doing the weekly washing in huge tubs - the suds spilling over the sides.\n\nSanta Ana is a sleepy town on the northern tip of the main island of Luzon. There is little activity around the tiny Filipino naval base which is so tucked away on a corner of the beach that you would barely know it was there - unless you spotted the \"restricted\" signs. Crucially it has an airstrip that will give the US access to the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\"It's not really a base. I would say it is more like a Boy Scout camp,\" exclaims Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba.\n\nRemote and idyllic islands like Basco have become strategically important because of their proximity to Taiwan\n\nThis is one of the four new bases in the Philippines that US troops can access as the two countries boost their military alliance. Two of the new locations are in the northern province of Cagayan and face Taiwan.\n\n\"This is not my call or the call of our people. It's the call of our national leaders. We will abide by it. We may disagree with it, but really it's all because we don't want war,\" says Mr Mamba.\n\n\"We are poor, and we have our local problems too. That is why any cause of uncertainty will be a bigger problem for all of us.\"\n\nMr Mamba is worried that having two US bases in his province will make it a target. He had hoped to bring Chinese tourists to the region, or build a new international airport. Now he fears that Beijing may snub the Philippines when it needs their business more than ever.\n\n\"It is hard for us to choose between the two of them. Between a neighbour who has never been our enemy and an ally who has stood by us through so many difficulties. If they could be together, if only they could talk, if only there was middle ground for them to meet.\"\n\nGovernor Mamba's comments reflect a growing anxiety across parts of Asia. Will they be forced to choose between a long standing ally, the US, and their largest trade partner, China?\n\nBack in Basco, in the capital of the tiny Philippine province of the Batanes islands, 21-year-old Ave Marie Garcia is helping travellers get flights to and from her home island of Itbayat.\n\nShe doesn't keep an eye on the news - but she couldn't fail to notice or hear about the latest military exercises.\n\nAve Marie Garcia says she hopes the growing alliance with the US doesn't change her home\n\n\"I don't think the US is going to cause war with these military exercises. It's just the US is trying to help the Philippine military to protect this island and to let the Chinese know that this region is protected,\" she says as she jumps on her scooter to show us her favourite views and beaches.\n\nAve is one of 11 children and like many in the Philippines, her mother works abroad to send money back to the family.\n\nTheir ancestral home, a traditional stone cottage which has stood through the centuries, lies in ruins after an earthquake in 2019 - a reminder that life is fragile here.\n\nAve and her siblings were brought up by what she describes as her strict grandmother. But in Ave there are small signs of rebellion. Her long dark hair is dip-dyed blonde at the ends.\n\nAnd yet, she is an Ivatan at heart. Her hope is to preserve her ancestors' way of life, even if that means saying no to the United States. She believes there should be limits.\n\n\"I am worried about the future - for our future. I hope they won't build structures here for the U.S military, I just want to leave it as it is. They are allowed to visit this place but they are not allowed to build something here that will cause anyone to invade us. For me it's scary.\"\n\nThe people here feel miles away from the politics and the bellicose rhetoric, and they try not to dwell on what could be, and enjoy what they have.\n\n\"An island life is a simple life,\" Ave says. Each day, she and her family pray it will stay that way.", "The World Health Organisation is calling for better access to fertility care around the globe.\n\nA report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found one in six people around the world experience infertility.\n\nThere also appears to be little difference in rates across high, middle and low-income countries.\n\nThe proportion of adults affected by infertility during their lives is 17.8% in high-income countries and 16.5% in low and middle-income ones.\n\nWHO is calling for better access to fertility care across all nations.\n\nInfertility, according to the NHS, is when a couple cannot conceive despite having unprotected sex regularly.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWHO defines infertility as a failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sex.\n\nMedical treatment for lack of ovulation or surgical procedures can be used to help women specifically, while intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are also available to assist couples with conception.\n\nThese treatments are available on the NHS, but IUI and IVF are often limited or require a strict set of requirements to qualify for access.\n\nWHO says in most countries, fertility treatment is funded by individuals rather than national health services, which can result in financial hardship for many.\n\nPeople in poorer countries spend a greater proportion of their income on fertility care compared to richer people, according to the report.\n\nHigh costs are seen as a factor preventing people from accessing treatment and ultimately being unable to conceive when natural methods fail.\n\n\"The report reveals an important truth - infertility does not discriminate,\" said the Director-General of WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom.\n\nHe added: \"The sheer proportion of people affected shows the need to widen access to fertility care and ensure this issue is no longer sidelined in health research and policy, so that safe, effective and affordable ways to attain parenthood are available for those who seek it.\"", "Tangaraju Suppiah was hanged for conspiring to traffic cannabis despite pleas for clemency\n\nSingapore has executed a man for conspiring to traffic cannabis despite pleas for clemency from his family, activists and the United Nations.\n\nTangaraju Suppiah, 46, was hanged at dawn on Wednesday over a plot to smuggle 1kg (35oz) of cannabis.\n\nActivists said he had been convicted on weak evidence and received limited legal access during his prosecution.\n\nBut Singapore authorities said he had been given a fair trial and criticised those who questioned the courts.\n\nSingapore has some of the world's toughest anti-drug laws. It argues these are a necessary deterrent to drug crime which is a major issue elsewhere across South-East Asia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tangaraju Suppiah's family gathered at Changi Prison near the city's airport in the east to receive his body.\n\n\"The family said they weren't going to give up on him until right until to the end,\" anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han told the BBC.\n\n\"They still have a lot of unresolved questions about his case, and the evidence against him. It has been such a harrowing experience for them.\"\n\nLast year Singapore hanged 11 people, all on drugs charges - including an intellectually impaired man convicted of trafficking three tablespoons of heroin.\n\nThe nation's stringent drug laws and use of capital punishment put it increasingly at odds with advanced nations and others in the region, activists say.\n\nSingapore's neighbour Malaysia abolished mandatory death penalties earlier this month, saying it was not an effective deterrent to crime.\n\nMeanwhile cannabis has been decriminalised in many parts of the world - including in neighbouring Thailand, where its trade is encouraged.\n\n\"It is just illogical to know that countries nearby are enjoying cannabis in food and beverages, and using it for its medical benefits, while our country is executing people for the very same substance,\" local activist group the Transformative Justice Collective said.\n\nSingapore's courts on Tuesday had rejected a last-minute appeal from Tangaraju Suppiah's family against his conviction.\n\nSupporters had also petitioned Singapore's President Halimah Yacob for a reprieve, while British activist billionaire Sir Richard Branson added his voice to those calling for a case review.\n\nThe UN's Human Rights Office had on Tuesday also called on Singapore to \"urgently reconsider\" the execution, saying the death penalty violated international norms.\n\nTangaraju Suppiah had been convicted of \"abetting by engaging in a conspiracy to traffic\" about 1kg (35oz) of cannabis from Malaysia to Singapore in 2013.\n\nHe was not found with the drugs or during the delivery. But prosecutors said he had been responsible for co-ordinating it, and they traced two phone numbers used by a deliveryman back to him.\n\nTangaraju denied his involvement - and said he had not been the person communicating with the deliveryman. He said he had lost one of the phones and denied owning the second one.\n\nSingapore's law mandates the death penalty for those guilty of trafficking narcotics - including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and ketamine - beyond a certain quantity.\n\nLeela Suppiah (centre) spoke to reporters on Sunday pleading for her brother's life\n\nConvicted traffickers who can prove that they were only couriers may be able to avoid the death penalty.

Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nStockton Rush was the chief executive of OceanGate, the firm which runs the Titanic voyages, and the company confirmed he was on board.\n\nHe was an experienced engineer who had previously designed an experimental aircraft and worked on other small submersible vessels.\n\nMr Rush founded the company in 2009, offering customers a chance to experience deep sea travel, and made global headlines in 2021 when it began offering trips to the site of the Titanic wreck.\n\nFor $250,000 (\u00a3195,600), his company offers passengers the opportunity to get an up-close glimpse of what remains of the famous ship.\n\nParticipants travel some 370 miles (595km) on a larger ship to the area above the wreck site, then do an eight-hour dive to the Titanic on a truck-sized submersible known as Titan.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in 2022, he defended the business model, and said the ticket price was a \"fraction of the cost of going to space and it's very expensive for us to get these ships and go out there\".\n\nA 2017 feature written for the website of Princeton University, where he studied, reported that Mr Rush goes on every OceanGate dive.\n\nMr Rush was married to Wendy Rush, who is the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, who died in the Titanic wreck after letting women and children escape before them.\n\nMike Reiss, a writer and producer of The Simpsons, went on a Titanic dive in a different OceanGate submersible with Mr Rush. He said the CEO was a \"magnetic man\", the New York Times reported, adding that he was \"the last of the American dreamers\".\n\nHamish Harding has flown to space and visited the South Pole\n\nThe British adventurer ran Action Aviation, a Dubai-based private jet dealership, and completed several exploration feats.\n\nHe visited the South Pole multiple times - once with former astronaut Buzz Aldrin - and flew into space in 2022 on board Blue Origin's fifth human-crewed flight.\n\nHe held three Guinness World Records, including longest time spent at full ocean depth during a dive to the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.\n\nIn summer 2022, he told Business Aviation Magazine that he grew up in Hong Kong, qualified as a pilot in the mid-1980s while studying at Cambridge, and set up his aircraft firm after making money in banking software.\n\nHe said the Titanic dive had been meant to take place in June 2022 but was delayed because \"the submersible was unfortunately damaged on its previous dive\". He said no-one was injured in the incident.\n\nAsked about his appetite for exploration, he said: \"My view is that these are all calculated risks and are well understood before we start.\"\n\nLast weekend, he said on Facebook that the mission was \"likely to be the first and only in 2023\" because of poor weather conditions in Newfoundland, Canada, where the missions set off from.\n\nLater, his stepson Brian Szasz said in a now-deleted post on Facebook that his stepfather \"has gone missing on (the) submarine\".\n\nFriend David Mearns, a marine scientist and expedition leader, described Mr Harding as a \"very charming guy\" who was attracted to extreme adventures.\n\nPatrick Woodhead, founder of British tour operator White Desert Antarctica, said Mr Harding was an \"incredible\" aviation explorer, and that his thoughts and prayers were with Mr Harding's wife, Linda, and his sons.\n\nTerry Virts, a retired Nasa astronaut, said his friend was the \"quintessential British explorer\" who loved adventure and exploring, but was not an adrenaline junkie.\n\n\"Some people watch Netflix, some people play golf, and Hamish goes to the bottom of the ocean, or into space, and he's set world records flying around the planet,\" he told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.\n\nLucy Cosnett, Mr Harding's cousin and goddaughter, called for a full investigation into his death as she described him as a \"lovely caring person\".\n\n\"When I read they had heard banging noises I was feeling hopeful that maybe it was coming from the submersible. But then yesterday was the worst when I heard that he didn't make it, that they all died,\" she said.\n\n\"There should have been more safety checks done. The company OceanGate should have done more\u2026 it should be fully investigated, to see what went wrong, why it happened, why they didn't survive.\"\n\nMs Cosnett added she was also feeling sad that she would not be able to wish her godfather a happy birthday as he would have turned 59 years old this weekend.\n\nMr Harding - along with Paul-Henry Nargeolet who was also on board - was a member of the Explorers Club, a little known century-old exploration group whose members have included Sir Edmund Hillary and Amelia Earhart.\n\nIts president, Richard Garriott de Cayeux, said Mr Harding's excitement over the expedition had been palpable during a meeting at last week's Global Exploration Summit.\n\nBritish businessman Shahzada Dawood was from one of Pakistan's richest families. He was travelling on the sub with his son Suleman, a student.\n\nMr Dawood lived with his wife, Christine, and other child, Alina, in Surbiton, south-west London. The family were spending a month in Canada prior to the dive.\n\nShahzada was vice-chairman of Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corporation, which is a large fertiliser firm.\n\nHe worked with his family's Dawood Foundation, as well as the SETI Institute, a California-based research organisation which searches for extra-terrestrial life.\n\nShahzada was also a supporter of two charities founded by King Charles III - the British Asian Trust and the Prince's Trust International.\n\nA Palace spokesperson previously said the King's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with all those onboard.\n\nWill Straw, the chief executive officer of Prince's Trust International, said he was \"deeply saddened by this terrible news\".\n\nThe British Asian Trust said it was an \"unfathomable tragedy\".\n\n\"We try to find solace in the enduring legacy of humility and humanity that they have left behind and find comfort in the belief that they passed on to the next leg of their spiritual journey hand-in-hand, father and son,\" a spokesperson for the trust added.\n\nShahzada's family said he was interested in \"exploring different natural habitats\", and had previously spoken at both the United Nations and Oxford Union.\n\nHe studied in Philadelphia, in the US, and the University of Buckingham in England, where he graduated in 1998.\n\nSuleman was a student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where he had just completed his first year at the university's Business School.\n\nFollowing news of his and his father's death, Suleman's aunt told NBC News the 19-year-old had said he felt \"terrified\" about the trip, but wanted to please his dad.\n\nA family statement described the teenager as a \"big fan of science fiction literature and learning new things\", and having an interest in Rubik's cubes and playing volleyball.\n\nHe recently graduated from ACS International School Cobham in Surrey, according to local media reports.\n\nThe university's principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, wrote to students to inform them that Suleman was in the missing sub.\n\nHe said the student wellbeing team was available to support those affected by the news.\n\nThe plight of Suleman and his fellow passengers had been raised at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf said: \"My thoughts are very much with the families and the communities that are affected.\"\n\nPaul-Henry Nargeolet was a diver in the French Navy\n\nAlso on board was Mr Nargeolet, a former French Navy diver.\n\nNicknamed Mr Titanic, he reportedly spent more time at the wreck than any other explorer and was part of the first expedition to visit it in 1987, just two years after it was found.\n\nHe was director of underwater research at a company that owns the rights to the Titanic wreck.\n\nAccording to a company profile, Mr Nargeolet supervised the recovery of thousands of Titanic artefacts, including the \"big piece\", a 20-tonne section of the boat's hull.\n\nFamily spokesman Mathieu Johann described Mr Nargeolet as a \"super-hero for us in France\".\n\n\"He is the world specialist on the Titanic, its conception, the shipwreck, he has dived in four corners of the world,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\u00c9ric Derrien, director at Genavir, a subsidiary of the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, where Mr Nargeolet had worked for more than 10 years, said staff \"shared the grief of his family and friends\".\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the death of this insatiable explorer of the ocean, who left his mark on Genavir.

The Dalai Lama has since expressed regret.\n\nThe incident has sparked significant online vitriol against the spiritual leader.\n\nWhile much of it centres on the video, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour and child abuse, a significant portion of the criticism accuses him of complicity in \"slavery\", using highly disputed definitions seen in Chinese propaganda.\n\nThere are also concerns that overall, the online backlash is fuelling anti-Tibet sentiment.\n\nActivists say that while many of the talking points have long existed online - propagated by pro-China accounts - they are now attracting a wider audience as the video controversy renews global attention on Tibet.\n\nIn Twitter threads and TikTok videos that have attracted millions of views and retweets, social media users are discussing the living conditions and lack of rights held by ordinary Tibetans before the country was annexed by China in the 1950s.\n\nMany describe this as \"slavery\". They also frame the Chinese annexation as an act of liberation for Tibetans.\n\nThey argue that as the Tibetans' spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was complicit, and some posts label him a \"demon\" and \"slaveowner\".\n\nBut these characterisations of Tibetan society and China's annexation have long been controversial - and mirror the Chinese government's rhetoric.\n\nBeijing promotes a narrative where it freed \"serfs and slaves\" from a brutal theocracy, set Tibet on a path of modernisation, and vastly improved Tibetans' lives.\n\nIt has also accused the Dalai Lama of spearheading a failed uprising in 1959 in order to \"preserve the theocratic serf system\". The Dalai Lama has said the incident began with Tibetans gathering to protect him from a possible Chinese attack.\n\nThe incident ended with the Chinese taking over Tibet's government and dissolving what they say was a feudal system. In 2009, China created the annual \"Tibetan Serf Emancipation Day\" to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the quelling of the uprising.\n\nIn recent weeks Chinese state media outlet Global Times re-amplified this narrative by putting out an infographic comparing life before and after Tibet's \"peaceful liberation\", in a tweet criticising the Dalai Lama. It was subsequently retweeted by at least one Chinese embassy.\n\nThough Tibet's government-in-exile has disputed the term \"feudal\", most scholars agree that Tibet's society saw people working on estates owned by nobles, monasteries or the state, and paid taxes to them.\n\nThere has been debate on how to describe these people. The Tibetan word for them, \"miser\", has been translated as both \"serfs\" and \"subjects\".\n\nBut most experts do not see them as \"slaves\" which could be bought and sold.\n\n\"Tibet has never had a term for 'slave'. These people were not commodities\u2026 it was like a 'peasant and lord' relationship,\" said Tsering Shakya, a Tibet historian with the University of British Columbia.\n\nHistorically the Dalai Lama did not directly own \"serfs\", but as he was seen as the sovereign of Tibetan society, \"everyone in Tibet was considered his subject, much like people in the UK are subjects to the King\", said Dr Shakya.\n\nCritics of China's narrative, such as Tibet's government-in-exile, say Beijing uses it to justify the annexation and its oppression of Tibetans over the years.\n\nTibetan activists accuse China of human rights violations and have campaigned for the release of prisoners\n\nWhile Tibetans' standard of living has greatly improved, Tibet remains tightly controlled by Chinese authorities who are accused of committing violence and human rights violations.\n\nThousands of Tibetans are believed to have been killed during various periods of martial law over the years.\n\n\"You don't emancipate anyone with [an] army and guns. You don't liberate anyone with forced agreement,\" a representative of the Tibetan government-in-exile said in 2020.\n\nSome have also argued that Tibet was already on the path of reform and did not need China's intervention.\n\n\"There were people advocating modernisation before annexation, there were seeds of change,\" said Dr Shakya.\n\nEarlier this week Tibet's government-in-exile accused China of waging a campaign to \"vilify\" them and the Dalai Lama.\n\nIts head, Penpa Tsering, also claimed without evidence that \"pro-Chinese sources\" were making the Dalai Lama's video go viral on social media and said \"the political angle of this incident cannot be ignored\".\n\nA BBC Monitoring check did not find signs of inauthentic online activity, indicating that the criticism comes from genuine sources.\n\nIt also found the criticism came from diverse sources. While pro-China influencers as well as Chinese diplomats and state media were responsible for some of it, right-wing commentators and social media users concerned about child abuse and slavery have also joined in.\n\nActivists say the backlash has fuelled online abuse of Tibetans, pro-Tibet groups, and the Tibetan leadership in exile. It has also obscured numerous human rights issues that activists are trying to raise, including the forced assimilation of Tibetan children.\n\n\"There is a frustration that Tibet largely goes unreported but now is in the spotlight for this reason, and fear that this story will become the centrepiece of the conversation about Tibet at a critical time for the future of their country and its culture,\" John Jones, spokesperson for the Free Tibet organisation, told the BBC.\n\n\"In that sense, this story has been a gift to anyone wishing to downplay the concerns Tibetans have been trying to raise.\"", "President Joe Biden was speaking at the National Safer Communities Summit in Connecticut, calling for tougher gun control laws when he seemingly confused the audience by closing his speech with the phrase \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nVideos of the president's unusual sign off quickly started circulating online, with social media users questioning what he meant.\n\nThe White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary, Olivia Dalton, later responded to reporters by saying the president was \"commenting to someone in the crowd\".", "John Lewis has axed its staff bonus for a second time and signalled job cuts are in the pipeline, after what it described as a \"very tough year\".\n\nThe department store firm, which also owns Waitrose supermarkets, reported a \u00a3234m pre-tax loss.\n\nPartnership chair Dame Sharon White said the stores had attracted more customers, but they had spent less.\n\nShe said the losses meant bonuses could not be issued this year for the second time since it began the scheme in 1953.\n\nDame Sharon suggested the firm may have to reduce staff numbers, or \"partners\" as they are known at the company.\n\n\"As we need to become more efficient and productive, that will have an impact on our number of partners,\" she said.\n\nWhen questioned about specific plans around job losses Dame Sharon said: \"There are no numbers.\"\n\nBut the firm said it faced a \"more challenging environment\" and was tripling its target to make savings from \u00a3300m to \u00a3900m by January 2026.\n\nIt said savings would be made through the sale of assets, such as its Berkshire golf club, and by improving productivity.\n\nMeanwhile, the plan to move into the residential property market was \"working really well\" Dame Sharon said.\n\nJohn Lewis said its long-term aim was for almost half (40%) of profits to come from outside of shops by 2030.\n\nBut Dame Sharon said soaring prices last year had \"hit us like a hurricane\" and that customers had \"felt the pain\".\n\nDespite Waitrose reporting more shoppers in the year to the end of January, customers spent less. It said the size of the average basket fell by 15% and people were buying cheaper items.\n\nConsequently, full-year sales at Waitrose fell by 3% to \u00a37.31bn.\n\n\"The big online growth of the pandemic years was partly reversed,\" said Dame Sharon, adding: \"Shoppers shifted some of their grocery spending to the discounters.\"\n\nThe cost of living crisis has hit John Lewis hard, with worse-than-expected results. Customer numbers may be up but they are buying less, especially at Waitrose, which revealed a drop in volumes of 10% for the year.\n\nThe group is also grappling with its own spiralling costs, up by nearly \u00a3180m in a year, including higher energy bills and pay. It has already made \u00a3300m of savings as part of its existing plans to turnaround the business. Now the firm's chair Dame Sharon White says she wants to save another \u00a3600m by 2026. That will likely mean job losses as the business tries to become more efficient.\n\nShe has appointed the Partnership's first ever chief executive to supercharge the transformation and get profits back on track. That's not an easy job right now in the current economic environment.\n\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth said shoppers were \"cherry picking what they buy at Waitrose\".\n\nThe decline in Waitrose sales was significant Ms Shuttleworth said: \"Volumes are the life-blood of supermarket businesses - the more you sell, the better the prices you can offer to shoppers.\n\n\"One glimmer of hope is that shoppers are back in department stores with sales up 20% - the strategy to invest more in a reduced store network is clearly working especially at seasonal peaks particularly Christmas.\"\n\nThe figures come following recent upheavals within senior management after Pippa Wicks departed as executive director of the department store business.\n\nNish Kankiwala was appointed on Wednesday as John Lewis' first ever chief executive and will oversee the daily running of the entire business.\n\nIt is the third year of pre-tax losses for John Lewis. Last year, it reported a \u00a327m loss, far below this most recent result.", "The research rocket was part of experiments being conducted by Sweden in zero gravity\n\nSweden has got into hot water with Norway after one of its research rockets malfunctioned and landed in its neighbour's territory.\n\nThe rocket was launched at 07:20 local time (05:20 GMT) on Monday from the Esrange Space Center, before plunging into a Norwegian mountain range.\n\nThe Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which owns and runs the centre, has apologised and is investigating.\n\nBut Norwegian officials say Sweden failed to let them know formally.\n\n\"The ministry did not get formal notification, and when an incident like this happens across the border it's important that those responsible immediately inform the Norwegian authorities through proper channels,\" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Ragnhild Simenstad.\n\nAccording to the SSC, the rocket reached an altitude of 250km (155 miles) and made it into zero gravity, where it carried out experiments in microgravity into potential carbon-free fuels and creating more efficient solar cells.\n\nBut the rocket then landed some 40km north-west of the planned landing site, 15km into Norwegian territory in the far northern area of Malselv. It is described as a mountain range roughly 10km from the closest inhabited area, at an altitude of around 1,000m (3,280ft).\n\nNobody was injured and no material damage has been reported.\n\nThe scientific instrument onboard the rocket, known as the payload, weighs 387kg (853lbs) and has since been recovered in \"good condition\" and returned to Esrange by helicopter, according to the SSC.\n\nSSC spokesman Philip Ohlsson explained that while the first stage motor of the rocket had landed close to the Esrange base site in Sweden, the second stage motor and the payload had parachuted on to Norwegian territory.\n\n\"This is a deviation that we take seriously,\" said Marko Kohberg from the Esrange Space Center. \"It is still too early to speculate about the cause, and we await more information from the current investigation.\"\n\nAccording to Esrange, Norway's armed forces and Swedish authorities were contacted shortly after the incident, and it followed the routines laid out for rocket launches after Monday's flight.\n\nLocal authorities in Malselv have told public broadcaster NRK they were told about the incident and asked if a helicopter could be sent to retrieve the rocket.\n\nBut Norway's foreign ministry has said it received no formal notification either of the rocket's landing or the recovery of its payload.\n\n\"For our part it's important to remember that a rocket and incident like this can contribute to large damage. The fuel might be contaminated and there might be poisonous material. We just want to expect the proper rules are followed,\" said Ms Simenstad.\n\nThe rocket, known as Texus-58, is part of a European programme commissioned by the European Space Agency.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO); the Ulster Teachers Union (UTU) and the National Education Union (NEU).\n\nThe NASUWT has been calling for a 12% increase in salaries, following deadlock over a pay deal for the past year.\n\nIn Northern Ireland teachers were offered a 3.2% rise spread over two years from 2021 to 2023.\n\nBut unions said that due to changes in pay scales many teachers would get less than 3.2%.\n\nDr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said teachers had been left with no choice.\n\n\"Our members are not prepared to stand by while their pay packets shrink and their living costs rise,\" he said.\n\n\"The Department of Education and employers must bring forward a substantially improved pay offer if they want to see an end to this dispute.\"\n\nMembers of multiple trade unions were present at Belfast City Hall on Tuesday morning\n\nAt Belfast City Hall, teacher Emer Bloomer described the strike as a \"show of solidarity\".\n\n\"All unions are uniting to say none of us are happy at the minute, it can't continue like this and something has to be done,\" she added.\n\nHealthcare workers Orlaigh Sewell and Lisa Heaney said they were striking \"to save the NHS\".\n\n\"They're stripping it down piece by piece,\" Orlaigh explained. \"At the end of the day, it has to be safe for patients\".\n\nHealth visitor Lisa Heaney added: \"There's more demands, there's more support needed for the families we're going out to visit and we don't have the staff to facilitate that.\"\n\nFionnuala McTaggart, who has been teaching in north Belfast for three years, said there has been a noticeable increase in her workload that can be \"really overwhelming at times\".\n\nHer school, along with many others, opened from 12.00 GMT, to allow children to access free school meals.\n\n\"It's not this easy job that people make it out to be, you're not just out colouring with kids all day, you're doing real work that's hard and meaningful and important,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\nWithout a Stormont executive and extra money in the education budget it's hard to see how the teachers' pay dispute can be resolved.\n\nThe problem is we don't know where the money would come from for any revised pay deal.\n\nThe Department of Education has pointed out that the education budget is under real pressure.\n\nThis may be the first action of many but with no ministers in place it's hard to see who is listening.\n\nEdel McInerney, vice president of the NEU Northern Ireland, said: \"It's been such a paltry sum that's been offered that actually in fact it's a pay cut that they're offering us, not a pay deal - we're looking for fair pay.\n\n\"They [the Department of Education] need to think outside the box, they need to see where money can be saved so that the heart of education - the teachers - are remunerated properly,\" she said.\n\nGerry Murphy, from INTO, said teachers had been backed into a corner while the UTU's Jacqui White said the unprecedented move was a reflection of the strength of feeling.\n\nThe Department of Education said there had been active engagement between managers and teachers about pay.\n\nBut the statement said negotiations were taking place at a time of growing and unprecedented financial pressures within the education sector.\n\nIt said management remained committed to reaching a resolution that ensured teachers were fairly remunerated.\n\nIn Omagh, workers gathered outside the courthouse as strikes continue\n\nTeachers were joined at a number of rallies across Northern Ireland by striking workers from the health unions.\n\nWorkers were told they would get a 2022-23 pay award of \u00a31,400, but unions said this would not settle the dispute as it was lower than inflation.\n\nIn January, more than 20,000 healthcare staff in Northern Ireland took part in a one-day strike.\n\nTeaching staff across Northern Ireland walked out until midday\n\nThe Department of Health said the strikes would undoubtedly impacts patient care.\n\nBut it added that it fully understood the frustration of staff who continued to work in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\n\"This a national dispute which is only resolvable at national level. Northern Ireland has a policy of pay parity with England HSC workers covered by the Agenda for Change framework,\" the department said.\n\n\"Given that policy position, the absence of ministers and current budgetary realities, there is no scope for a resolution at local level.\"", "Some of the UK's biggest pension funds have voted against reappointing BP's chairman over a decision to weaken its climate plans, but the majority of shareholders backed Helge Lund.\n\nIt comes after the energy giant cut back its target to reduce emissions by the end of the decade.\n\nAs well as the dissenting votes there were also disruptions during the annual meeting from climate protestors.\n\nBP said it valued \"constructive challenge and engagement\".\n\nThe original target to reduce emissions was agreed by shareholders in 2022 and included a promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35% to 40% by the end of this decade.\n\nBut in February, BP announced it was now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut so it could produce more oil and gas and extend the life of existing fossil fuel projects.\n\nBP chief executive Bernard Looney said this was in response to increased concerns about energy security following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe five pension funds told the BBC that their vote against the company's chairman, Helge Lund, was a protest against the company's actions.\n\nThe pension funds have \u00a3440m invested in BP, which represents less than 1% of the company's total shares. But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.\n\nMr Lund received a majority of more than 90% for re-election during the annual meeting on Thursday.\n\nKatharina Lindmeier, senior responsible investment manager at Nest, the government-backed pension fund, told the BBC: \"Not only were we disappointed to see the company going back on the targets, but we were also really surprised not to have had any consultation.\"\n\nThe five pension funds - Nest, the Universities Pension Scheme, LGPS Central, Brunel Pension Partnership and Border to Coast - are concerned that the new targets put BP financially at risk because the company's fossil fuel projects are likely to lose value as the world moves towards net zero emissions.\n\nNest also told the BBC that there were concerns over BP's actions on reducing gas flaring, after seeing the BBC documentary Under Poisoned Skies.\n\nThe BBC News investigation showed that BP was one of several major oil companies not declaring emissions from gas flaring at oil fields in Iraq, which produces cancer-linked pollutants.\n\nAli Hussein Julood, who documented his life in Rumaila, Iraq for the documentary, suspected his childhood leukaemia was due to the flaring.

The former Australia bowler talks about restoring his reputation following his public ridicule in 2010", "On Monday, thousands of junior doctors in England will start a 72-hour strike. They want a 35% pay rise. Yet doctors are among the highest paid in the public sector. So why do they have the biggest pay claim?\n\nThe origins of the walkout by British Medical Association members - the biggest by doctors in the history of the NHS - can be found in a series of discussions on social media platform Reddit in late 2021.\n\nA collection of junior doctors were expressing their dissatisfaction about pay.\n\nThe numbers chatting online grew quickly and by January 2022 it had led to the formation of the campaign group Doctors Vote, with the aim of restoring pay to the pre-austerity days of 2008.\n\nThe group began spreading its message via social media - and, within months, its supporters had won 26 of the 69 voting seats on the BMA ruling council, and 38 of the 68 on its junior doctor committee.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Rob Laurenson stood for BMA election on a Doctors Vote platform\n\nTwo of those who stood on the Doctors Vote platform - Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi - became co-chairs of the committee.\n\n\"It was simply a group of doctors connecting up the dots,\" Dr Laurenson says. \"We reflect the vast majority of doctors,\" he adds, pointing to the mandate from the wider BMA junior doctor membership - 77% voted and of those, 98% backed strike action.\n\nAmong some of the older BMA heads, though, there is a sense of disquiet at the new guard. One senior doctor who has now stood down from a leadership role says: \"They're undoubtedly much more radical than we have seen before. But they haven't read the room - the pay claim makes them look silly.\"\n\nPublicly, the BMA prefers not to talk about wanting a pay rise. Instead, it uses the term \"pay restoration\" - to reverse cuts of 26% since 2008. This is the amount pay has fallen once inflation is taken into account.\n\nTo rectify a cut of 26% requires a bigger percentage increase because the amount is lower. This is why the BMA is actually after a 35% increase - and it is a rise it is calling for to be paid immediately.\n\nThe argument is more complicated than the ones put forward by most other unions - and because of that it has raised eyebrows.\n\nFirstly, no junior doctor has seen pay cut by 26% in that period. There are five core pay points in the junior doctor contract with each a springboard to the next. It means they move up the pay scale over time until they finish their training.\n\nA junior doctor in 2008 may well be a consultant now, perhaps earning four times in cash terms what they were then.\n\nSecondly, the 26% figure uses the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation, which the Office for National Statistics says is a poor way to look at rising prices. Using the more favoured consumer price index measure, the cut is 16% - although the BMA defends its use of RPI as it takes into account housing costs.\n\n\"The drop in pay is also affected by the start-year chosen,\" Lucina Rolewicz, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, says. A more recent start date will show a smaller decline, as would going further back in the 2000s.\n\nAnother way of looking at pay is comparing it with wages across the economy by looking at where a job sits in terms of the lowest to highest earners.\n\nThe past decade has not been a boom time for wage growth in many fields, as austerity and the lack of economic growth has held back incomes.\n\nLast year, the independent Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration Body looked at this. It found junior doctors had seen their pay, relative to others, fall slightly during the 2010s, but were still among the highest earners, with doctors fresh out of university immediately finding themselves in the top half of earners, while those at the end of training were just outside the top 10%.\n\nThen, of course, career prospects have to be considered. Consultants earn well more than \u00a3100,000 on average, putting them in the top 2%. GP partners earn even more.\n\nA pension of more than \u00a360,000 a year in today's prices also awaits those reaching such positions.\n\nBut while the scale of the pay claim is new, dissatisfaction with working conditions and pay pre-date the rise of the Doctors Vote movement.\n\nStudying medicine at university takes five years, meaning big debts for most. Dr Trivedi says \u00a380,000 of student loans are often topped up by private debt.\n\nOn top of that, doctors have to pay for ongoing exams and professional membership fees. Their junior doctor training can see them having to make several moves across the country and with little control over the hours they work.\n\nThis lasts many years - junior doctors can commonly spend close to a decade in training.\n\nIt is clearly hard work. And with services getting increasingly stretched, it is a job that doctors say is leaving them \"demoralised, angry and exhausted\", Dr Trivedi says, adding: \"Patient care is being compromised.\"\n\nBut while medicine is undoubtedly tough, it remains hugely attractive.\n\nJunior doctor posts in the early years are nearly always filled - it is not until doctors begin to specialise later in their training that significant gaps emerge in some specialities such as end-of-life care and sexual health.\n\nLooking at all doctor vacancy rates across the NHS around 6% of posts are unfilled - for nurses it is nearly twice that level.\n\nMany argue there is still a shortage - with not enough training places or funded doctor posts in the NHS in the first place.\n\nBut the fact the problems appear more severe in other NHS roles is a key reason why the government does not seem to be in a hurry to prioritise doctors - formal pay talks to avert strikes have begun with unions representing the rest of the workforce\n\n\"If we have some money to give a pay rise to NHS staff,\" a source close to the negotiations says, \"doctors are not at the front of the queue.\"\n\nAre you taking part in the strike action?

Rupert Murdoch: \"This is the most humble day of my life\"\n\nThe man who has had such a hold over Britain's media since he arrived in London in the late 1960s to buy the News of the World was forced into that humiliating one-liner.\n\n\"This is the most humble day of my life,\" he told MPs (with the theatre of the event heightened by his then wife Wendi Deng later launching herself at a protester who attacked her husband with a custard pie).\n\nNow Murdoch has been forced into another humiliating climbdown, this time in relation to his US operations.\n\nYet again, it's the Murdoch empire's approach to truth that is in the spotlight.\n\nFox News argued it was fighting a court case against voting machine company Dominion in the interests of free speech, a US First Amendment right.\n\nInstead, it appeared that the network relegated fact-based journalism for fiction in the wake of America's 2020 presidential election.\n\nSome of Fox News' most prominent personalities had been expected to testify in the Dominion lawsuit trial\n\nWe already know, from Fox News emails and messages published in February as part of the legal case, that many Fox executives and presenters didn't believe claims of voter fraud - but broadcast them anyway.\n\nThe network carried on giving a platform to people endorsing the views of Donald Trump and his supporters that the election had been stolen - in part, it seems, because it didn't want to upset its viewers.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, pictured at the NRA annual meeting last week, repeatedly claimed the 2020 election was stolen\n\nSuzanne Scott, the Fox News Media chief executive, told Murdoch just before rioters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021 that the channel needed to be careful about \"pissing off the viewers\".\n\nWith 7,000 documents now in the public domain, there has already been a lot of damaging material to chew over. Huge questions remain over the impact Fox News and its broadcasts had over the divisions apparently tearing the US apart. Truth took a back seat and the impact is still being felt.\n\nPerhaps, for Murdoch, the final straw was the prospect of facing another public humiliation, this time in court. Fox's lawyers had failed to persuade the judge that he shouldn't be called to the stand.\n\nAlong with his son Lachlan, Fox Corporation's executive chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch would have had to give evidence.\n\nRupert Murdoch and and his son Lachlan were both expected to give evidence in the trial\n\nAnd it's clear Dominion's lawyers would not have settled for a one-liner from the media mogul.\n\n\"The most humble day of my life\" simply wouldn't have cut it. It would have been hugely embarrassing.\n\nAlthough the case never reached trial and the Murdochs never took the stand, reputationally the damage surely equals that of the hacking scandal.\n\nSo where does this leave the man who has been integral to the fabric of the media landscape in the UK, the US and Australia for so long?\n\nRuthlessness and risk-taking built the Murdoch empire, whether that was his victory over the print unions in the early days of his ownership of the Times and Sunday Times, or his determination to create the right-wing Fox News, credited with helping get Trump elected in 2016.\n\nRupert Murdoch pictured with Donald Trump in 2016, before the US election that saw Trump become president\n\nHis critics will be crowing over the Dominion settlement.\n\nOn CNN, presenter Jake Tapper (who said it was difficult to report the outcome \"with a straight face\") called it \"one of the ugliest and most embarrassing moments in the history of journalism\".\n\nAnd this isn't the end of the matter. Another voting software company, Smartmatic, is also suing Fox over its broadcasts about voter fraud. It could be even more costly. Smartmatic wants more than Dominion - $2.7bn (\u00a32.2bn) in defamation damages.\n\nIn the UK, the Murdoch empire has already paid out many millions in damages to people who accused it of phone hacking.\n\nPrince Harry is trying to take Murdoch's News Group Newspapers to court over alleged phone hacking\n\nPrince Harry is part of a group of claimants trying to take Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, which includes the Sun, to court over alleged phone hacking.\n\nHow damaging will all this be?\n\nThe $787.5m payout to Dominion is a huge amount. But Fox's revenue in the last quarter of 2022, for example, was $4.6bn (\u00a33.7bn) - and the share price has barely moved in light of the settlement.\n\nPerhaps there's a lesson to learn from 2011. At the time, the horrific story of the News of the World's exploitation of Millie Dowler's murder felt to many like a watershed.\n\nThe News of the World newspaper printed its final edition in 2011\n\nIt cost the empire dearly in the short term - but, while the phone hacking fallout and financial outlay are ongoing, Murdoch's influence has only spread since then.\n\nHe's older now, at 92. He has also suffered a more personal embarrassment recently.

Another woman said that Mr Trump had forcibly kissed her while she was interviewing him for an article she was writing in 2005.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTwo long-time friends of Ms Carroll testified that she told them about the encounter shortly after it occurred.\n\nOn the stand, Ms Carroll described in graphic detail what she alleges happened in the store and the trauma she says she has endured as a result.\n\n\"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he lied and said it didn't happen,\" she told the court.\n\nMr Trump called no witnesses and appeared only in a video of a deposition that was played for jurors in which he denied rape.\n\n\"It's the most ridiculous, disgusting story,\" Mr Trump said in the footage. \"It's just made up.\"\n\nMs Carroll's lawsuit also argued that Mr Trump had defamed her in an October 2022 post on his social media site in which he called her claims a \"complete con job\" and \"a Hoax and a lie\".\n\nHer legal team argued Mr Trump had acted as a \"witness against himself\" during the deposition when he doubled down on comments he made in a 2005 recording.\n\nIn the audio, known as the Access Hollywood tape and leaked in 2016, Mr Trump suggested women let stars \"do anything\" to them, including grabbing their genitals.\n\nThat's what he did to Ms Carroll, her lawyer argued.\n\nIn the recorded video deposition, Mr Trump at one point confused Ms Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples, which Ms Carroll's lawyers argued undermined his claim that she was \"not his type\".\n\nMr Tacopina sought to cast doubt on Ms Carroll's story, which he called \"a work of fiction\".\n\nHe questioned why Ms Carroll could not specify the date of the attack, arguing that it stripped Mr Trump of the chance to provide an alibi.\n\n\"With no date, no month, no year, you can't present an alibi, you can't call witnesses,\" Mr Tacopina said. \"What they want is for you to hate him enough to ignore the facts.\"\n\nMr Tacopina also pressed her on why she did not report a crime to police or scream while it occurred.\n\nThe former Elle magazine columnist was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\n\nThe law allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state involving claims that would have normally exceeded statute limitations.", "The boss of John Lewis has said the company will always be owned by its staff, \"no ifs, no buts\" as employees backed her in a vote of confidence.\n\nDame Sharon White ruled out selling a stake in the business, but said the board could consider external investment in future if it was needed.\n\nShe previously was understood to be considering a change to its employee-owned structure after over 70-years.\n\nBut the move sparked anger from staff, who currently fully own the retailer.\n\nAs well as each owning a stake in the business, John Lewis and Waitrose staff - referred to by the company as partners - have a say in the way it is run and receive a share in its profits.\n\nOn Wednesday, the partners cast their votes in their usual biannual vote on the company's performance and leadership.\n\nThe votes are symbolic rather than binding.\n\nDame Sharon has been seeking radical ways to boost growth after making a huge loss last year and as it struggles to compete with High Street rivals.\n\nHowever, she told staff she wanted to be \"absolutely categorical, John Lewis would always be employee-owned\".\n\n\"Our model is the very reason I joined the partnership because I believe profoundly in an approach of kinder capitalism in the 21st century,\" she added.\n\n\"It's what makes us special.\"\n\nDame Sharon did admit that \"if at any point the partnership couldn't fund their plans through their own means, the board could consider external investment\", but stressed that it would have to be in line with the partnership's original trust settlement.\n\nShe said it would also need the backing of the council who represent staff.\n\nWednesday's confidence vote was held during the all-day meeting, at the Odney Club, a John Lewis-owned retreat near Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nChris Earnshaw, president of the Partnership Council, said the group made up of staff members voted in support of Dame Sharon's leadership.\n\nHowever, he said the council did not support last year's performance, following the full-year losses and no staff bonus.\n\nThe ballot has come at an awkward time for Dame Sharon, who has chaired John Lewis since 2020 and is trying to turn around its fortunes.\n\nThe chain has been struggling to compete with High Street rivals such as Amazon and Primark, while its supermarket chain, Waitrose, has underperformed Tesco and Aldi during the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe partnership posted its first annual loss, of \u00a3517m, in 2020 and has since announced a series of store closures. It also plans to cut \u00a3900m of costs by January 2026 and job losses are likely.\n\nThe retailer sparked anger in March, when it told its about 74,000 partners they would have to go without a bonus for the second time in three years.\n\nSome 85% of fewer than 1,000 staff surveyed at the time said they were not confident in the company's ability to deliver its strategy.\n\nIn March, brand expert Mary Portas wrote an open letter to the partnership, saying one of the most \"valued, loved, and trusted retail brands\" in the UK had \"let go\" of its soul.\n\nAhead of the vote, GlobalData retail managing director Neil Saunders, a former partner at John Lewis, said there was a sense John Lewis had been a \"bit on the back foot\" and slow to react to changes in the retail markets compared with its rivals, such as Marks and Spencer.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: President Zelensky shared a video of the dam on Telegram\n\nThousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia.\n\nWater is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson.\n\nRussia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC.\n\nThe Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region.\n\nIt provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt said this would be followed by a period of \"stabilisation\", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days.\n\nThere are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling.\n\nThe situation there is said to be under control and there is \"no immediate nuclear safety risk\" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nVideo footage shows a torrent of floodwater gushing through a breach in the dam. Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train.\n\nAbound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east.\n\nAlso speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded.\n\nHe accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. A building is seen floating along the Dnipro river in the Kherson region\n\nOne local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to \"drown\" his city.\n\nIn the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: \"We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up.\"\n\nShe called for Russian forces to be \"kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else\".\n\nAnother resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared \"everything is going to die here\".\n\n\"All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,\" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens.\n\nThe city of Kherson is 50 miles downstream of the dam\n\nOn the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated.\n\nHe said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety.\n\nWater levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added.\n\nThe small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said.\n\nThe Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.\n\nThis seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive.\n\nFor Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem.\n\nJust as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions.\n\nHowever, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water.\n\nA major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. \"We will still liberate all our land,\" he said in a video address.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue.\n\nAn aerial image shows water pouring through what appears to be a breach in the dam\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the \"epicentre of hostilities\" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun.\n\nBakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nYuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams.\n\n\"They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has branded the attack on the dam \"ecocide\" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river.\n\nUkrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been \"completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away\".\n\nWorld leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would \"demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression\".\n\nThe head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was \"shocked by the unprecedented attack\".\n\nThe Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nInternational food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) is suspending its operations in Gaza following the death of seven of its workers in an Israeli air strike.\n\nThree of the killed aid workers were British citizens, WCK said.\n\nThe charity said those killed were part of an aid convoy that was leaving a warehouse in central Gaza on Monday.\n\nWCK is one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza.

I felt completely powerless,\" he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, jurors heard the alleged victim's police interview, in which he said Mr Spacey \"smelt of booze\" before grabbing him \"like a cobra\".\n\nHe said Mr Spacey had directed a \"machine gun\" of \"vile comments\" at him.\n\n\"It was horrific. I've never had anyone speak to me in that way,\" he said during Thursday's cross examination.\n\n\"He wasn't screaming at me, but it was like a torrent.\n\nHe added he was then physically attacked by the actor, who he said grabbed his penis.\n\n\"I didn't scream.

He said he would have been seen as a \"troublemaker\".\n\nMr Spacey, 63, has been described by the prosecution as a \"sexual bully\".\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty all the charges he faces.

He is the first Italian known to have been killed by a bear in recent years.\n\nThe animals are a protected species in Italy, and their population has been increasing in recent years after they were reintroduced to the region two decades ago.\n\nJJ4's own parents had been brought into northern Italy from Slovenia under the \"Life Ursus\" European conservation project.

If so then prove it.\"\n\nThe first minister said an election win would mean securing the most seats in Scotland - even if the party ends up with fewer than the 45 it currently holds.\n\nMr Yousaf also told the convention a summer campaign would focus on the \"opportunities of independence\" and announced a major march and rally would be held in Edinburgh on 2 September.\n\nThe convention was held at the same time as an independence rally in Stirling\n\nMr Yousaf's speech was interrupted by a protestor demanding a public inquiry into NHS Tayside about its disgraced former head of neurosurgery Sam Eljamel.\n\nThe SNP leader stopped his address and went to speak to the woman before returning to the stage after arranging to meet her later.\n\nSeveral other senior SNP politicians also addressed the convention on both the route to independence and its general election strategy.\n\nAs well as contributions from the floor it also featured \"interactive activist workshops\".\n\nEarlier, there was tributes to former SNP MP Winnie Ewing, an icon of the independence movement who died earlier this week at the age of 93.\n\nThe event will also be used to kickstart a summer programme of independence campaigning, which the party said would include leafleting, canvassing and regional assemblies.\n\nThere has been criticism from some within the SNP and wider Yes movement of the decision to only allow party members to attend the convention, which is being held at the same time as an All Under One Banner independence march in Stirling.\n\nFormer SNP leader Alex Salmond, who now heads the Alba Party, has been among those calling for a cross-party convention to be created that would include the SNP, Alba and other independence supporting parties and organisations.\n\nHe also wants an agreement that would see only one pro-independence candidate stand in each constituency at the general election - a proposal which seems unlikely to be accepted by the SNP.\n\nIn the heat and humidity of the hall, it sounded like Humza Yousaf was going for what's been called a \"de facto referendum\".\n\nThat was using a general election to begin negotiations on independence if won.\n\nIn the coolness of a briefing room, SNP insiders made clear it's not that - it's a nuanced approach.\n\nIn the the most basic way, it's about contesting the general election according to the rules of the game.\n\nSuccess is measured by seats won - whereas in a de facto referendum, success is measured by the popular vote\n\nIt's about saying to the UK government - prove that it's a voluntary union and if the SNP succeed then a referendum should be granted.\n\nThe ball is in their court, the SNP say.\n\nThis approach squares off difficulties - Mr Yousaf has commanded that marches are used to drum up support - that takes them away from the fringes.\n\nIt also neatly gets away from the need to get 50% of the vote - \"polls are tight\", Mr Yousaf noted.\n\nMembers I spoke to were enthused. That's the point - this is about injecting momentum back into the movement.\n\nDespite the widespread assumption that Brexit and Boris Johnson would be gifts for the independence movement, Nicola Sturgeon - who was recently described by Mr Yousaf as being Europe's most impressive politician - did not manage to consistently push support for leaving the UK above 50%.\n\nThe UK government repeatedly refused to give her permission to hold a referendum despite the SNP's electoral successes during Ms Sturgeon's eight years as first minister and party leader.\n\nThe Yes movement was dealt a further blow last November when the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish government did not have the powers to hold a vote without that permission being in place.\n\nMs Sturgeon's response to the court ruling was to propose treating next year's general election as a \"de facto referendum\".\n\nIf the SNP won more than 50% of the votes in the election it would regard it as an endorsement of independence, and the party would then attempt to open negotiations with the UK government.\n\nThe UK government would have been under no legal obligation to do so, however, and the plan was deeply unpopular among many SNP MPs, with Stewart MacDonald - previously seen as being one of Ms Sturgeon's staunchest allies - openly criticising it.\n\nMr Yousaf had previously distanced himself from a \"de facto referendum\" plan during the contest to succeed Ms Sturgeon as SNP leader and first minister earlier this year.\n\nWith polls suggesting support for the party has fallen in recent months his attempt to resurrect it will be seen as a big gamble.\n\nThe SNP leadership has also consistently ruled out holding a referendum that was not seen as being legally binding.\n\nMr Yousaf has previously said he wants to be the \"first activist\" as well as first minister\n\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said independence support is running at an average of 48% in recent polls - higher than support for the SNP itself.\n\nA Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times last weekend put the SNP at 34% for the next general election and suggested that the party could be on course to win fewer seats than Scottish Labour, a prospect that would have seemed almost unthinkable a year ago.\n\nThe past few months have seen both Ms Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell being arrested and their home searched as part of an ongoing police probe into the SNP's funding and finances.\n\nBoth were later released without charge while further inquiries were carried out.\n\nThere has also been controversy over the Scottish government's handling of issues ranging from ferries and NHS waiting lists to gender reform and the deposit return scheme.\n\nFollowing Mr Yousaf's address Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Donald Cameron said the first minister had \"decided to abandon the pretence he is governing for the whole country\".\n\nHe added: \"The latest push of his independence obsession appears to be an even more extreme version of Nicola Sturgeon's unpopular de facto referendum strategy.\n\n\"The SNP delegation that bothered to turn up to Dundee are speaking to themselves about their number one priority while people are struggling with the global cost-of-living crisis and our public services are under incredible pressure.\"\n\nShadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray accused the first minister of \"clearly preparing for failure\" with his plans.\n\nHe said: \"We need a government focused on tackling the urgent challenges we face - from the cost of living crisis to the chaos in our NHS to a declining economy - but in the SNP we have a tired party rehashing the same old tired arguments.\n\n\"Today has laid bare just how bereft of fresh ideas the SNP truly is - even when it comes to their driving constitutional obsession.\"\n\nAnd Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"The SNP have put on an entire conference dedicated to demonstrating how tired, out of touch and bereft of ideas they are.\n\n\"Nobody believes Humza Yousaf's plan is going to lead to the break-up of the UK. It's a desperate ploy to appease a dwindling band of single-minded nationalist activists.\"", "There has been a surge in executions in the Islamic Republic, prompting protests inside Iran and abroad\n\nIran has executed two men who were convicted of \"burning the Quran\" and \"insulting the Prophet of Islam\", the country's judiciary says.\n\nYousef Mehrad and Sadrollah Fazeli-Zare ran dozens of social media accounts \"dedicated to atheism and desecration of the sanctities\", the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.\n\nMr Mehdad's lawyer had insisted that he was innocent and his sentence unjust.\n\nThere has been a surge in executions in the Islamic Republic amid continuing anti-government unrest, but those for blasphemy convictions are rare.\n\nMizan said Yousef Mehrad and Sadrollah Fazeli-Zare were hanged at Arak Prison in central Iran on Monday morning.\n\nThe two men were arrested in 2020 and accused of running a Telegram channel called \"Criticism of Superstition and Religion\", according to Iran's Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA). They were held in solitary confinement for the first two months and denied access to a lawyer, it said.\n\nIn 2021, the Arak Criminal Court convicted Mr Mehrad and Mr Fazeli-Zare on blasphemy charges and sentenced them to death, HRANA added. They were also given six-year prison sentences for \"running groups to act against national security\".\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected their appeals against the verdicts and upheld their death sentences later that year, Mizan said, adding that both men had \"clearly confessed to their crimes\".\n\nHuman rights group say Iranian courts regularly fall far short of providing fair trials and use false \"confessions\" obtained under torture as evidence.\n\n\"The execution of Yousef and Sadrollah for 'insulting the Prophet' is not only a cruel act by a medieval regime, it is also a serious insult to the freedom of expression,\" said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Norway-based group Iran Human Rights.\n\n\"These executions must be a turning point in the relations between the Islamic Republic and countries respecting the freedom of expression,\" he added. \"Lack of a strong reaction by the international community sends a green light to the Islamic Republic and their ideological allies worldwide.\"\n\nOn Saturday, a Swedish-Iranian dual national accused of being behind a deadly attack on a military parade in 2018 was hanged. The European Union condemned \"in the strongest terms\" the execution of Habib Chaab.\n\nIran is second only to China in the number of executions carried out annually.\n\nIt has put to death more than 200 people since the start of this year, according to a tally by Iran Human Rights.\n\nThe group has said the number of executions rose by 75% to 582 last year, as authorities sought to \"spread fear\" among those taking part in the nationwide protests sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September.", "It's feared a wave of unhygienic pranks will scare off sushi train customers\n\nJapanese police have arrested three people over \"sushi terror\": viral, unhygienic pranks that are threatening the world-famous feature of sushi conveyor belt restaurants.\n\nLast month, a video of a man licking a soy sauce bottle on a sushi conveyor went viral, sparking outrage.\n\nIn the video, he can be seen squashing sushi dishes at a Kura Sushi restaurant branch.\n\nSince then, dozens of such videos have proliferated sparking public concern.\n\nIncidents filmed include diners - many of whom are children and young people - spoiling others' orders by touching sushi dishes passing by.\n\nOne video which emerged last month showed a customer putting wasabi on another's dish, while another person licked the presented chopsticks.\n\nIn another video, filmed at a Sushiro chain outlet, a diner is seen rubbing saliva on passing sushi pieces.\n\nThe viral trend has horrified many Japanese and spurred action from several conveyor-belt sushi chains - known as kaitenzushi locally.\n\n\"I know people from overseas look forward to eating sushi here so as a Japanese person, I am ashamed of such actions,\" one woman Yukari Tanaka told the BBC.\n\nAnother person, Nana Kozaki, said: \"Kaitenzushi is Japanese culture we can be proud of but actions of few people like that really ruins that.\"\n\nOthers said they were \"a bit scared\" by the trend - admitting they were less willing to go to restaurants.\n\nJapan is renowned for its exacting cleanliness standards and culinary etiquette.\n\nSo the \"sushi terrorism\" pranks have not only shocked millions around the country but also led to falls in share prices of companies like the Sushiro chain.\n\nThis has spurred several kaitenzushi chains to make public appeals for offenders to stop their food sabotage.\n\nSome eateries have even made the choice to stop operating their main attraction altogether - with sushi conveyor belts coming to a halt across the country.\n\nIn eastern Japan, the Choushimaru chain said it would stop using its conveyor belts altogether after a customer placed a cigarette butt in a jar of pickled ginger.\n\nStaff will now bring dishes to customers directly - and only hand out condiments and sauces when they've taken their seats.\n\nA spokesman for the Kura Sushi - the restaurant chain targeted by those arrested on Wednesday - said the viral video trend was \"extremely dangerous\" and posing a threat to the foundation of the conveyor-belt restaurant model.\n\n\"Conveyor belt sushi is something we are proud of as part of Japanese culture. We want to make sure our customers can eat sushi delivered on the belt safely and comfortably,\" he said.\n\nSeveral sushi chains have already threatened legal action - but Wednesday's detentions are believed to be the first arrests of offenders.\n\nPolice in the central Japanese city of Nagoya allege Ryoga Yoshino, 21, licked a communal soy sauce bottle at a Kura Sushi conveyor-belt sushi restaurant on 3 February.\n\nTwo minors aged 19 and 15 were also involved. Police said their actions constituted obstruction of business under Japan's Penal Code.\n\nAll of the suspects admitted to the wrongdoing, police said. One also reportedly apologised for his actions.\n\nRestaurant-owning companies had already been struggling - with global supply chains under strain to a weaker yen, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany had to raise prices on their cheapest offerings last year.\n\nNow they face another struggle with the wave of unhygienic pranks.\n\nIt's led to restaurants around the country scrambling to reassure customers of their hygiene standards.\n\nThe Sushiro chain changed its service rules last month, requiring diners to collect their own utensils and condiments from staff to cut down on potential sabotage attempts.\n\nKura Sushi has now also developed an alert system, where some of its conveyor belts will now be equipped with sensors and cameras.\n\nIf a person is caught returning a plate that has been tampered with, an alert will be sent to the chain's offices in Saitama prefecture, near Tokyo and Osaka. The affected restaurant would also be informed, Kura Sushi said.\n\nThe company said the new sensors would also be able to identify the specific plate and seat number affected.", "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there would be \"no pardons\" if anyone was identified as a perpetrator and convicted\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called the wave of suspected poisonings of schoolgirls in recent months an \"unforgivable crime\".\n\n\"If there are any people involved in the matter, and there certainly are... the perpetrators must be given the most severe of punishments,\" he warned.\n\nMore than 1,000 girls at dozens of schools have been affected by unexplained illnesses since November.\n\nIncidents were reported in at least 15 cities and towns on Sunday alone.\n\nAuthorities have released very little information about their investigations and announced no arrests, but they have accused Iran's \"enemies\" of using the suspected poisonings to undermine the clerical establishment.\n\nSome Iranians believe the girls' schools are being targeted by hard-line elements to stop them receiving an education.\n\nOthers suggest the authorities may be punishing girls for their leading role in the nationwide anti-government protests that erupted in September.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Those who have UK visas but are not the dependent of a British passport holder can still come to the UK via other routes.\n\n\"We are keeping this under close review and recognise that there will be many people facing very challenging circumstances and decisions.\n\n\"We continue to work intensively, alongside international partners, to maintain the ceasefire and bring an end to fighting - the single most important thing we can do to ensure the safety of British nationals and others in Sudan.\"", "Ukraine's then-president described Tony Blair as a \"sincere friend\" of his country in the archived documents\n\nTony Blair was urged to back Ukraine's dream to join the EU to form a barrier against Russian threats, newly released records from his time as PM show.\n\nHis special Europe adviser told him Kyiv wanted a \"special relationship... if only we would show more interest,\" the National Archives reveal.\n\nUkraine's then-president, Leonid Kuchma, also wrote to Mr Blair appealing for his support.\n\nBut Nato has refused to give Kyiv a timeline for membership.\n\nAccording to the documents dating back more than 20 years, Mr Kuchma appealed directly to then-prime minister Mr Blair to back Ukraine's long-term goal of \"full-scale European and Euro-Atlantic integration, including the full-fledged EU membership\".\n\nIt had been barely a decade since Ukraine gained independence in 1991 and President Kuchma, in power since 1994, added in a handwritten note that he pinned great hopes on Mr Blair, as a \"sincere friend\" of Ukraine... on your personal support in this exceptionally important issue\".\n\nMr Kuchma had first declared Ukraine's intention to join the EU in 1998, but there was little enthusiasm for it in Germany or France. One of the biggest stumbling blocks was that Ukraine was beset with corruption and its businesses run by powerful oligarchs.\n\nFor all his Western leanings, Mr Kuchma's own government was tainted by the gruesome 2000 murder of a journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, who was one of the Ukrainian leader's biggest public critics. Mr Kuchma has always denied complicity in his death.\n\nAccording to the newly released documents, Roger Liddle, who served as an adviser to Mr Blair on European affairs, said immediate EU or Nato membership was unlikely but he urged the prime minister to become more engaged.\n\nAfter July 2001 talks in Crimea, 13 years before it was seized by Russia, he wrote to the prime minister: \"Strengthening Ukraine's shaky democracy and economy increases stability on the EU's future eastern borders and acts as a formidable barrier to any resurgence of Russian imperialism to the West.\"\n\nBy December 2001, after a Ukrainian delegation had taken part in talks in the UK, Mr Liddle said the Ukrainians were \"depressed... that most of Europe and the new US administration is running them down\".\n\nGeorge W Bush had become US president that year, and had decided that Russia's Vladimir Putin was a \"very straightforward and trustworthy\" leader. The 9/11 attacks were very recent and the US needed Russian support to enable the military campaign to go ahead in Afghanistan.\n\nOther stories from the National Archives:\n\nUkraine's Leonid Kuchma repeatedly pressed the EU for membership, here with EU Commissioner Chris Patten\n\nKataryna Wolczuk, professor of East European politics at the University of Birmingham, believes that by 2001 UK leaders had little concern about Russia's future plans for Ukraine, as President Putin was \"still in his Euro-Atlantic ally mood\".\n\nAfter the talks at Chevening with the Ukrainians, Roger Liddle's conclusion was: \"We have too rosy a view of Putin (who according to them is a clever, presentable power politician, but no democratic hero). And we rubbish Ukraine.\"\n\nProf Wolczuk argues that President Kuchma and his entourage were instinctively pro-European: \"They knew they couldn't trust Putin and Russia, and yet the system Kuchma presided over was a hostage of that system.\"\n\nThe archive documents also show support for Ukraine's position from the UK's ambassador to Kyiv, Roland Smith, who cautioned against a proposal by then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw for the EU to give Ukraine \"special neighbour status\" along with Belarus and Moldova.\n\nThe ambassador wondered why the plan appeared formulated to deny Ukraine the chance of full EU membership: \"Because Ukraine is simply too big? Because really we think that Ukraine ought to go back to Russia where she belongs?\"\n\nHe asked why it differed from the plan for countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, which eventually joined the EU in 2007.\n\nIn 2004 Ukrainians took to the streets protesting against electoral fraud, in an Orange Revolution that saw supporters back a pro-European president over a candidate backed by the Kremlin.\n\nIn the event the EU did choose a watered-down relationship for Ukraine and its neighbours, and the UK played a big role in supporting it.\n\nBut Mr Blair's European adviser said in his archived note at the end of 2001 that the main Ukrainian pitch had been for \"associate membership\" of the EU - far stronger than what was then being offered.\n\nThat agreement was eventually signed in 2014, months after Ukraine's pro-Russian president had refused to go through with it, triggering a revolution that ultimately brought him down.", "Questions have been raised over what to do with the large granite monument at the Swiss cemetery\n\nFor decades the huge monolithic block of granite in the middle of the cemetery in the Swiss town of Chur was ignored by passers-by; no one seemed to know quite what it was.\n\nBut the 13-tonne (13,000kg) stone monument that dwarfs the nearby gravestones is now causing controversy - and embarrassment.\n\nResearch by a local journalist has revealed links to Nazi Germany, and to neutral Switzerland's own awkward relations with its World War Two neighbours.\n\nChur's cemetery is in the centre of town. Many people, like radio journalist Stefanie Habl\u00fctzel, pass it every day on the way to work or out shopping.\n\nNowadays the monument at the cemetery, untended, is covered in moss. The engravings on it are difficult to discern.\n\nThe origins of the monument and its links to the Nazi presence in Switzerland were unknown\n\n\"At first sight it looks like a war memorial,\" says Stefanie, pointing out some faint lettering: \"1914 - 1918; hier ruhen deutsche Soldaten\u2026 here lie German soldiers.\"\n\nWhy, though, would German soldiers be buried here?\n\nIn fact, thousands of wounded prisoners of war, French and British as well as German, were treated and interned in Switzerland during World War One. Some died from their injuries, others during the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nBut Chur's monument was not built until 1938. \"That's 20 years after these men died,\" says Stefanie. \"It wasn't built to mourn these dead soldiers, it was built for propaganda reasons, for the Nazi regime.\"\n\nSwiss historian, Martin Bucher, explains that, as the Nazis grew in power in Germany, their propaganda involved cult-like worship of their war dead. In the 1930s the German War Graves Commission became part of Hitler's propaganda machine. Its task, to create visible signs of Nazi power in Germany's neighbours as well as at home.\n\nThere were many thousands of Germans living in Switzerland at the time, and, Martin says, they were organised. \"In Switzerland all these organisations you know from Germany existed. The National Socialist Party, the German Labour Front, the Hitler Youth. They were all here, but only for Germans, not for Swiss people.\"\n\nGermany's War Graves Commission submitted ambitious plans to build a vast mausoleum in the Swiss town of St Gallen. This was rejected by Swiss authorities. But the monument in Chur was approved.\n\nPolished and engraved in Munich, using the Fraktur font, a typeface favoured in 1930s Germany, it was delivered to Chur on the eve of World War Two.\n\nAt the time Chur's residents must have known what it was, Martin insists. \"On Nazi holidays they put Swastikas on this monument\u2026 people would have seen it was a Nazi monument.\"\n\nSome were clearly unhappy. Stefanie Habl\u00fctzel, who has reported on the story for Switzerland's public broadcaster SRG, uncovered an indignant letter to the local newspaper, written in 1938, asking: \"Why do we have a Nazi stone in our cemetery?\"\n\nI didn't realise how many Nazi organisations were present in the 1930s, here in Chur\n\nBut some will have been supportive.\n\nSwiss sympathisers of Nazi Germany were well-documented in canton Graub\u00fcnden, of which Chur is the capital. But homegrown Swiss fascist parties never really took off, getting only two seats in the Swiss parliament in 1935, and never standing again.\n\nWhile Switzerland still has no official memorial to the Holocaust, parliament did approve plans for one in March last year. There are, however, around 50 unofficial monuments.\n\nThroughout the war, Germans in Switzerland continued to be active in the Nazi party, and continued to display their Nazi sympathies. And the Swiss, hoping as usual to stay out of the fighting, made compromises with Berlin, banking Nazi gold, and turning away Jewish refugees.\n\nThen, just one day after the war ended, neutral Switzerland got off the fence. \"There was a huge purge,\" says Martin. \"The Swiss government tried to punish Swiss Nazis, there were trials.\"\n\nGerman Nazis, meanwhile, were expelled. \"I think after that a lot of people were thinking it's done now, the Nazis are away, no problem,\" he says. \"And I think they forgot this monument.\"\n\nHistorian Martin Bucher says Hitler's propaganda machine was tasked with creating visible signs of Nazi power in neighbouring countries\n\nSo complete was this collective amnesia that today, among people like Stefanie Habl\u00fctzel, born decades after the war, the origins of the monument, and the Nazi presence in Switzerland, were a revelation.\n\n\"I grew up here in Chur,\" she says. \"And I didn't realise how many Nazi organisations were present in the 1930s, here in Chur.\"\n\nEven local member of parliament Jon Pult was taken by surprise. \"Switzerland wasn't Nazi-free, and I knew that,\" he says. \"But I didn't know about this monument.\n\n\"I live maybe 500 metres from the cemetery where this stone is, and I walked past that stone probably a hundred times, and I never realised that it is of course a Nazi stone. Now that I know it's very clear. I get it, I see it.\"\n\nSo, what should happen now?\n\nDespite a certain embarrassment, very few people have suggested tearing down the monument. But even fewer say it should be left just as it is, Stefanie says.\n\nInstead, consensus seems to be forming around a proposal to re-examine and publicise that period in Swiss history, just as Switzerland had to re-examine, and apologise for, its treatment of Jewish refugees during the war.\n\n\"I think it should stay in Chur,\" says Martin.\n\n\"But I think it's important to tell people why it is there,\" he adds. \"Maybe it can be a monument to remember all the people who died in the Second World War.\"\n\nJon Pult agrees that Switzerland should \"create a memorial\" out of the monument \"to remember the horrific crimes of the Nazis\".\n\nBut also, he says, the monument, and the information he expects to be placed in the cemetery with it, should serve as a warning.\n\n\"We should create a culture of knowledge about this, because as we know there is always a danger of fascist ideologies, totalitarian ideologies, as we see now for example in Russia.\"", "Ukrainian forces are preparing for a counteroffensive near the besieged city of Bakhmut\n\nIn a bunker just outside the city limits of Bakhmut, Ukraine's 77th Brigade direct artillery fire to support their infantry - their last line of defence on the western edge of the city.\n\nUkraine is still clinging to the last few streets here.\n\nBut the live video feed the artillery gunners watch intently, from a drone flying above the city, suggests that even if Russia can finally wrestle control, it would be little more than a pyrrhic victory.\n\nThe prize is now a crumpled, skeletal city - with hardly a building left unscathed, and with its entire population vanished.\n\nThe battle for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has been the longest and bloodiest of this war so far. Western officials estimate between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded here, while Ukraine's military has also paid a heavy price - and it still isn't over.\n\nThe plumes of smoke still hang heavy over the besieged city, accompanied by the relentless rumble of artillery fire.\n\nRussia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, and it's been a testament - so far - to Ukraine's determination not to give ground. But it's also a reminder that its coming counteroffensive could prove far more challenging.\n\nDrone footage from above Bakhmut shows the devastation caused by the continuing battle for the city\n\nBack in the bunker, Ukraine's 77th Brigade orders another artillery strike on a house. Seconds later a plume of smoke rises from the rubble. Two men emerge from the smoke, stumbling down a street. One appears to be injured.\n\nI ask if they're Wagner soldiers - the Russian paramilitary force which has been leading the assault. \"Yes,\" replies Myroslav, one of the Ukrainian troops staring at the screen.\n\n\"They are fighting quite well, but they don't really care about their people,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that they don't seem to have much artillery support and they just advance in the hope that they'll be \"luckier than the last time\". His comrade, Mykola, interjects: \"They just walk towards us, they must be on drugs.\"\n\nLooking at this shell of a city it's hard to understand why either side has sacrificed so many lives for it.\n\nMykola admits that the defence has also been costly for Ukraine. He says many soldiers have given their lives, and it's hard to fight in the densely packed streets. He says they've been replaced by troops with less experience, but adds: \"They will become the same warriors as those who fought before them.\"\n\nThe whole point of Bakhmut is to keep the enemy there\n\nTo the south of the city, Ukraine's 28th Brigade has been helping prevent Bakhmut from being encircled.\n\nThe Wagner forces they once faced have already been replaced by paratroopers of Russia's VDV, or airborne forces. But they're still locked in daily skirmishes.\n\nDuring a lull in the fighting, Yevhen, a 29-year-old soldier, takes us on a tour of their defensive position in a small wood.\n\nThe arrival of spring has provided them with some leaves for cover, but many of the trees have been stripped by the constant shelling.\n\nUkrainian troops seek cover behind bushes on the outskirts of the city of Bakhmut\n\nAs we run from a trench, across exposed ground pock-marked by shell holes, the Russians open fire with their mortars. \"That was pretty damn close,\" says Yevhen in perfect English as we reach some cover.\n\nAs we move to another position he says: \"Now we're going to fire back.\"\n\nMinutes later his men follow up with a volley of small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). There are no casualties this time. But hours after we leave one of their soldiers is seriously injured.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has called Bakhmut \"a fortress\" of Ukrainian morale. Yevhen displays that determination not to give up. \"The whole point of Bakhmut is to keep the enemy there,\" he says.\n\nIf Ukraine gave up Bakhmut, he says, they'd only lose more lives later. \"We could retreat to save a few lives, but we would then have to counter-attack and we'd lose even more\".\n\nUkraine's hope is that the fight over Bakhmut has blunted Russia's ability to conduct its own offensive operations, and exhausted its army and supplies.\n\nIn a bunker just outside the city limits, Ukraine's 77th Brigade direct artillery fire to support their infantry\n\nBut Russia has also been preparing to stymie Ukraine's upcoming offensive.\n\nRecent satellite images of the occupied south show it has built hundreds of miles of deep trench lines and dragon's teeth tank traps to slow down any attempted advance. More difficult to punch through than the razor wire and mines we saw in front of these Ukrainian positions.\n\nSouthern Ukraine is where many expect the focus of the Ukrainian offensive to be. Russia has already ordered a partial evacuation near the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUkraine, too, has been rationing artillery rounds in preparation for an attack that will be spearheaded by newly trained brigades of troops and some of the 1,300 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks supplied by the West. Though we have also witnessed convoys of Western military equipment heading East.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has tried to dampen down expectations - warning against \"overestimating\" the outcome.\n\nI ask Yevhen if he feels that pressure too. He says he knows it won't be easy, but adds: \"We've already changed the whole world's opinion of the Ukrainian army and we still have lots of surprises.\"\n\nBut this time it may prove harder to conceal the element of surprise.", "Matthew phoned William Hill to close his account, but the firm allowed him to carry on betting\n\nA gambling addict has said bookmaker William Hill should have done more to help him stop betting when he was staking thousands on single bets.\n\nMatthew, not his real name, from south Wales, racked up more than \u00a370,000 of debt with William Hill between 2012 and 2019.\n\nCalls showed he was angry and upset, with gambling rules saying bookmakers should intervene at signs of distress.\n\nWilliam Hill said it found no shortcomings in its procedures.\n\nMatthew, a teacher and father of three, had a salary of about \u00a335,000 a year when he started staking small amounts on big events such as the Grand National.\n\nBefore long, he was opening online accounts and taking advantage of free bets.\n\nHe said this escalated as he \"chased\" small losses, with his stakes increasing from a couple of pounds to as much as \u00a310,000 at once.\n\nWilliam Hill made him a gold customer - its VIP scheme - and Matthew was soon staking his \u00a32,300 a month take-home salary on payday.\n\nIn a Radio 4 documentary named Desperate Calls, Matthew has listened back to 89 phone conversations he had with William Hill.\n\nMost of these were to use a service called \"Quick Cash\", allowing him to withdraw money directly to the bookmaker without having to wait for money to clear in his bank account.\n\nThis service at William Hill is now called CashDirect.\n\nSometimes he would leave the shop with \u00a35,000 in cash.\n\nMatthew made calls from a phone box as he could no longer afford a mobile phone\n\nDozens of these calls were made from a dilapidated phone box just outside the shop.\n\nHe was spending so much on gambling he could not afford his mobile phone bill.\n\nWilliam Hill said Matthew won many times and withdrew thousands from his account, but Matthew said he would re-stake those winnings almost immediately.\n\nHe said: \"The dynamics changed rapidly, life revolved around gambling.\n\n\"On reflection life was a blur, I struggle to recall much of the last decade, other than some extremely dark thoughts, severe lows and the odd high. Not being focused on family and the people closest to me.\"\n\nHe still owes \u00a370,000 to family and friends.\n\nMany of the calls he made to William Hill showed him to be angry and upset.\n\nThe Gambling Commission has rules, saying operators should spot problem gamblers and intervene if they are showing signs of distress.\n\nMatthew said William Hill did not check with him on these points and allowed him to carry on betting.\n\nA member of staff from William Hill's due diligence team phoned Matthew after he said in an email he wanted to \"self-exclude\" because he was angry over a lack of free bets.\n\nThis meant closing his account permanently and banning him from other online betting sites too.\n\nBut during the conversation, the staff member discussed self-exclusion and other processes to curb Matthew's gambling, but ultimately allowed him to continue because he thought the complaint was due to the service he was getting and a lack of free bets, rather than a social responsibility issue.\n\nMatthew said he did not say he had a problem because stopping \"is not a desirable outcome at that point\".\n\n\"Underlying all that is you just want to win [the money] back\".\n\nIt reached a point when Matthew knew he had to stop gambling. His family took him to the GP and he has since had counselling to treat his gambling disorder.\n\nBut Matthew wanted to know what had happened: \"Once the cycle of gambling was broken I analysed a mountain of data obtained under a subject access request. I wrote a letter of complaint to William Hill.\"\n\nWilliam Hill said it took customer complaints seriously\n\nWilliam Hill said: \"We conducted a thorough investigation into our management of Matthew's account and identified no shortcomings in our safer gambling procedures in relation to Matthew's account requirements during the period in question.\n\n\"Ensuring high standards of safer gambling and preventing gambling-related harm is central to the way William Hill operates and we take any customer complaint in this area incredibly seriously, and are committed to driving continuous improvement in this area.\"\n\nThe bookmaker was fined \u00a36.2m in 2018 for failing to protect consumers.\n\nMany of the cases highlighted by the regulator were similar to Matthew's and occurred at about the same time.\n\nA UK government white paper is due to be published soon, with recommendations for strict affordability checks and a new ombudsman for consumer complaints expected.\n\nCurrently, people with social responsibility complaints can only write to the Gambling Commission, which cannot comment on what action it is taking, leaving many people in limbo.\n\nMatthew said: \"Without significant change there will be many more who fall foul of the pitfalls as I did. More lives destroyed, more families and friendships ruined and more lives lost.\"\n\nSupport for addiction issues is available via the BBC Action Line", "Humza Yousaf said he was honoured to have the backing of Mr Swinney, whom he described as \"a true giant of the SNP and independence movement\"\n\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney has backed Humza Yousaf in the race to replace Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and first minister.\n\nMr Swinney is the most high-profile figure in the party to endorse the Scottish health secretary.\n\nBut Kate Forbes' campaign manager said the announcement suggested the SNP hierarchy were \"absolutely panicking\".\n\nMr Yousaf is standing against the finance secretary and ex-community safety minister Ash Regan.\n\nSNP members will start voting for the new leader on Monday, with the winner to be announced on 27 March.\n\nMr Swinney's endorsement comes after the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn confirmed he would be supporting Mr Yousaf.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has previously said she would not be publicly backing any of the three candidates.\n\nLast month John Swinney questioned whether it would be appropriate for someone with Ms Forbes' views to be SNP leader.\n\nHe spoke out after the finance secretary, who is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, made clear she would not have voted for gay marriage if she had been an MSP in 2014.\n\nKate Forbes, Humza Yousaf and Ash Regan will take part in a BBC Scotland debate on Tuesday\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday night he said: \"Humza is best placed to lead our party because he will strengthen the SNP as a force for progressive change in Scottish politics.\n\n\"Humza will govern effectively by using the partnership that we enjoy with the Scottish Green Party - guaranteeing us a pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament.\n\n\"And crucially, Humza will widen our support in attracting new supporters to Scottish Independence.\"\n\nMr Swinney, who will stand down as deputy first minister later this month, said Mr Yousaf was the candidate who would \"complete our journey to independence\" and praised his track record in power.\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP added: \"Humza is an experienced minister who's done all the tough stuff that you have to do day in day out within government.\n\n\"He's put his heart and soul into all the work he's done within the party to make the SNP an inclusive political party.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said he was honoured to have the backing of a \"true giant of the SNP and independence movement\".\n\nHe added: \"Like Nicola, our party owes so much of our success to John's stewardship.\n\n\"John's backing is a massive boost to my progressive grassroots campaign to stand up for Scottish democracy, protect and advance rights, unite our Yes movement and secure independence for Scotland.\"\n\nIt's the endorsement every candidate wanted, short of that of Nicola Sturgeon herself.\n\nMany waited to see what John Swinney was going to do before deciding on their own leadership campaigns, such is his popularity within the SNP.\n\nSo this is a coup for Humza Yousaf - and an addition to the host of high-profile backers he has already got in the bag.\n\nIt does underline his position as the \"continuity candidate\", given much of the present regime is now backing him.\n\nAnd while Mr Yousaf insists he is very much his own man, he has embraced the idea that continuing the electoral success the party has enjoyed would be no bad thing.\n\nThere is a slight danger for him in appearing too much of an establishment figure, in a movement with a distinctly anti-establishment ethos.\n\nBut he will be hoping that the backing of influential members like Mr Swinney will trickle down to the grassroots and help to deliver victory.\n\nFollowing Mr Swinney's announcement Ms Forbes' campaign manager questioned the timing of the move.\n\nFalkirk East MSP Michelle Thomson said: \"When the current deputy first minister decides to personally intervene in the leadership contest at such a late stage, you get the sense that senior figures in the party have seen the polls and are absolutely panicking.\n\n\"Given how close we are to the vote opening, many party members will look upon this 11th hour intervention rather cynically. They don't need to be told by party HQ what to think or how to vote.\"\n\nMs Thomson said it appeared the SNP hierarchy would prefer \"an establishment transfer of power\" rather than allowing its members the freedom to make \"a healthy democratic choice\".\n\nBBC Scotland has asked Ms Regan's campaign for a response to Mr Swinney's statement.\n\nKate Forbes speaking at an SNP hustings event at Strathclyde University on Saturday\n\nVeteran SNP MSPs Annabelle Ewing and Christine Grahame are among those to have announced they will be voting for Ms Forbes.\n\nOne of the party's best known MPs, Joanna Cherry KC, has given her support to Ms Regan.\n\nThe three leadership candidates will take part in an hour-long Debate Night programme from Edinburgh at 20:00 on Tuesday 14 March on BBC One Scotland.", "Three men arrested earlier in connection with the attempted murder of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell have been charged with terrorism offences.\n\nDet Ch Insp Caldwell was shot after coaching a youth football team in Omagh, County Tyrone, on 22 February.\n\nThe men, aged 45, 47 and 58, have all been charged with preparatory acts of terrorism.\n\nThe 45-year-old and the 58-year-old have also been charged with possessing articles for use in terrorism.\n\nThey have both been further charged with providing property for the purposes of terrorism.\n\nAll three men are expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe men were arrested under the Terrorism Act in Newtownabbey, Coalisland and Belfast on Tuesday.\n\nThere have been 31 arrests to date over the attack on Det Ch Insp Caldwell - a figure that includes individuals who have been arrested more than once.\n\nThe shooting happened at a sports complex in Omagh\n\nThe dissident republican group the New IRA said it carried out the shooting, at a sports complex car park.\n\nSeven men have appeared in court charged in relation to the attack.\n\nThe shooting, which happened in front of school children, was widely condemned by political figures across Northern Ireland and beyond.", "Nooriyah has been DJing and producing for eight years\n\nYou're in a club, the music's pounding and the lights are flashing.\n\nYou look up to the DJ booth but there's no-one there, because it's an AI-generated mix.\n\nWith mixing software getting more sophisticated and venues cutting back on budgets, that's the worry of some people in the dance music industry.\n\nBut can a computer programme ever replace the real-life connection between a DJ and a crowd?\n\nIn a word, no.

That led to his suspension from the Conservative Party in April last year.\n\nHe announced his resignation in an interview with the Mail On Sunday in which the paper reports him as admitting to taking cocaine after drinking \"incredibly potent\" Japanese whisky.\n\nHe added in the interview: \"I was set up, but I have been naive and incredibly stupid.\" He went on to deny the harassment claims he is accused of.\n\nHis immediate departure means the Conservatives will now face a fourth by-election.\n\nMr Warburton has represented his constituency as an independent since losing the Tory whip. A writ for a new election is usually issued with three months of the resignation, according to Parliament's website.\n\nMr Warburton, who had taken the constituency from the Liberal Democrats in 2015, was re-elected in 2017 and 2019. He won with a majority of 19,213 in that last poll.\n\n\"My constituents in Somerton and Frome who elected me three times with overwhelming majorities have for a year been deprived of the voice they need,\" said Mr Warburton.\n\n\"I am so grateful for their many messages of support, and it is with sorrow that I have no choice but to provoke the upheaval of a by-election.\"\n\nHe also said in his three-page resignation letter he had been denied a fair hearing by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) and prevented from \"speaking out\" while it investigated the accusations.\n\nThe House of Commons rejected the claim saying ICGS was \"there to ensure all complaints are dealt with in a manner that is fair, thorough, independent and efficient\".\n\nIn a statement, a Commons spokesman said: \"We remain committed to ensuring that lasting cultural change can be delivered for all of those in Parliament.\"\n\nMr Warburton joins Boris Johnson and Nigel Adams who resigned last week triggering by-elections in their constituencies.\n\nNadine Dorries also announced her resignation, but said her departure would not be immediate as she wanted to stay while she seeks to investigate how she was denied a seat in the Lords on Boris Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nLabour's national campaign co-ordinator Shabana Mahmood accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak to act himself\" after Mr Warburton resigned \"in disgrace\".\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Time after time the Conservatives have mired themselves in sleaze and scandal neglecting the issues that really matter to people. Then they decided it was OK to leave local people in this seat without any proper representation at all.\"", "Will the indictment help or hinder Trump?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s next court date is not until December - which means he will be appearing as a criminal defendant just weeks before the Republican primary elections which determine who becomes the presidential candidate. Will that be a problem for his campaign \u2013 or can he turn this prosecution to his electoral advantage? In the days since it was announced he was to face criminal charges, his poll ratings have risen and his campaign claims to have raised over $10m. So his strategy of claiming to be the victim of a politically- motivated legal witch hunt seems to be working \u2013 so far. But Donald Trump is facing more legal investigations. He could yet be charged in the state of Georgia with trying to interfere with the results of the 2020 presidential elections. And in Washington DC a special counsel is looking at his role in the Jan 6th riots at the US capitol and the hundreds of classified documents found at his Florida home. Even for a politician with as much bravado as Donald Trump, fighting a presidential election at the same time as one or more criminal court cases will be more than a little complicated.

She is making history all the time. If anyone is going to take that record I would be delighted to see Jess do it.\"\n\nWales' new boss Wilkinson had promised pre-match that she was looking to implement her own coaching ideas slowly, favouring a \"evolution rather than revolution\" approach with a side she says are \"on a mission\" to qualify for a first major finals.\n\nShe was as good as her word as she opted to make just one alteration to the Wales side that impressed in a friendly win in Dublin, with Ella Powell replacing Josie Green who missed out through illness.\n\nWilkinson, capped 183 times by Canada but who has a Welsh mother, has spoken about her desire to fully embrace her heritage and she did an impressive job of singing Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau before kick-off.\n\nIt remains a little early in her tenure to assess exactly what a Wilkinson team is going to look like, but certainly it appears Wales will continue to try and play a more expansive, possession-based game.\n\nWales had 79% possession in the first half as they controlled the contest, while she also made an attacking change at half-time, introducing Ffion Morgan to replace Powell at right wing-back.\n\nWales' increased attacking impetus was obvious after the interval especially and after Fishlock's close-range header doubled Wales' lead, it was a matter of how many goals Wales would score.\n\nFishlock turned provider for Wales' third goal, crossing to Rowe when she could have shot, with Rowe firing into the bottom corner to make the result safe.\n\nThere was still time for Wales to push for more and they showed a clinical touch in front of goal with James spectacularly volleying home from an acute angle after Gemma Evans' cross-field pass caught out goalkeeper Bacic, who also saved to deny Mary McAteer a first Wales goal.\n\nSubstitute Ceri Holland struck the crossbar with a long-range effort as Wales pushed on, with Wilkinson even afforded the luxury of giving Fishlock, Rowe and Ingle a rest ahead of Wales' visit to Kosovo on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

So far, it has been confirmed to the BBC that eight of the dead were members of the military wings of the main Palestinian factions.\n\nGuns were fired in support of the deceased fighters.\n\nMany residents say they blame the Palestinian Authority (PA), the main governing body of the Palestinians in the West Bank, for not protecting them during the operation.\n\nVideos circulating online showed two PA representatives forced to leave a funeral after being chastised by the crowd.\n\nResidents complained that at the beginning of the operation the PA's security forces simply allowed the Israeli military vehicles to enter the city.\n\nFatina says she also blames the PA for their lack of action. \"This is our home. We are living in fear, and we are the only ones left to protect it.\"\n\n\"There are agreements between the PA and Israel. The PA has not broken the agreement and security services have done their job during the military operation according to what it was asked to do by the Palestinian leadership,\" Mayor of Jenin City and PA member Akram Rajoub told the BBC.\n\nOne fighter from a Palestinian militant group said that Israeli forces had successful destroyed several of its facilities, including a storage unit containing explosives.\n\nHowever, the scale of the operation inside a densely populated city and refugee camp was criticised by the UN's human rights chief.\n\nFor many residents like Fatina, immediate access to drinking water, food and shelter is now critical.\n\n\"Tonight we will sleep on the streets.

Watch: The fight over TikTok explained in 60 seconds\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will be opening a lion's mouth and placing his own head into it.\n\nHe's giving testimony in the US Congress for the first time, a scary thing to do.\n\nAnd at stake is the future of the phenomenally popular video-sharing app in the US.\n\n\"I think that there is a real risk that if this hearing doesn't go well\u2026 that could have a massive impact on the future of TikTok,\" said Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom.\n\nMr Chew is likely to face a barrage of questions on TikTok's relationship with China, what data it collects, and what it does with it.\n\nHe'll also be quizzed on why several journalists were spied on by ByteDance employees - something TikTok has already admitted.\n\nMr Chew will say user data is safe - away from the reach of the Chinese government.\n\nHe knows politicians from all sides want to see the platform either sold - or outright banned in the US.\n\n\"He's going into the lion's den,\" said Mr Stokel-Walker.\n\nMr Chew is going to need to give the performance of a lifetime. And already, close observers have seen a change of tactic from the Singaporean.\n\nTikTok's boss, who has had a range of senior positions in the world of finance, generally sports a suit jacket and tie.\n\nBut on Tuesday, he posted a TikTok with a very different look.\n\nInstead of a suit, he was wearing a white T-shirt and hoodie - the uniform of the nonchalant tech founder.\n\nThe 40-year-old was suddenly speaking like a teenager too - talking of being \"super excited\".\n\n\"I think he's trying to give off a sort of the casual tech bro,\" said Caitlin Chin from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank.\n\n\"He's actually been starting to gain a bit more of a public profile, especially leading up to this hearing.\"\n\nThe Singaporean has generally kept a low profile since taking over at TikTok in 2021.\n\nHowever, that approach appears to have changed. TikTok is fighting for its life, and Mr Chew knows it.\n\nThe big problem TikTok has in the US and Europe is that it is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance.\n\nAnd in China, there are specific laws that require companies to hand over information to the Chinese Communist Party if requested.\n\nShou Zi Chew and his wife, Vivian Kao, attend the 2022 Met Gala in New York City\n\nTikTok holds reams of data about its users, including location information and biometric data.\n\nFor years TikTok has argued that it would never hand over user information.\n\nIt has spent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying efforts and strategies to appease governments.\n\nAt the heart of its attempt to convince US lawmakers is \"Project Texas\".\n\nThis is the company's commitment to store US data in the US - on servers run by a US company - Oracle.\n\nThe company says so far it has spent $1.5bn on this project - and describes it as a \"firewall\" that protects data from foreign governments.\n\nTikTok had hoped it would satisfy politicians on all sides.\n\nLast year Mr Chew wrote to politicians saying he believed the project would \"safeguard user data and US national security interests\".\n\nBut sadly for TikTok, Project Texas has been looked at sceptically by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nFor many US politicians, for as long as TikTok has a Chinese owner, it will be considered suspicious.\n\nLast month FBI director Christopher Wray didn't mince his words about the platform.\n\n\"This is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese Government. And to me, it screams out with national security concerns,\" he said.\n\nFor most US lawmakers, TikTok would be a far more palatable platform if it were not owned by a Chinese company.\n\nLast week it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that the Biden administration had requested the company be sold for this reason.\n\nThis is not what ByteDance wants. TikTok has enormous potential. And besides, the Chinese company doesn't wish to sell its greatest asset simply because US politicians want them to.\n\nThis is the backdrop to Thursday's congressional hearing.\n\nWe already have a fair idea of what Mr Chew is going to say from TikTok briefings.\n\nHe'll argue that 150 million American users will lose out if the platform is banned - and that thousands of small businesses rely on the platform.\n\nHe'll push back on the idea that ByteDance is Chinese-owned - saying the company has many international investors.\n\nAnd he'll also argue that Chinese laws cannot compel ByteDance to share American data - because TikTok is a US-based company, with its data stored in the US.\n\nBut often these hearings make headlines for one or perhaps two specific exchanges.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's famous Senate hearing in 2018 is often remembered for one brilliant question from Senator Richard Durbin.\n\n\"Mr Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us which hotel you stayed in last night?\" he said.\n\nThe Facebook boss looked visibly uncomfortable before saying \"no\".\n\n\"I think that might be what this is all about\u2026your right to privacy,\" the senator said.\n\nIt's these curveball questions that Shou Zi Chew should fear most.", "If you feel like you're not getting paid enough, you're probably not alone.\n\nWhile average wages have been increasing, they haven't been keeping up with the rising cost of living, which means many people are finding it harder to get by.\n\nRecent months have seen waves of strikes, with tens of thousands of workers walking out in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\n\nMany of these strikes are taking place in the public sector, where workers often do not have the power to negotiate individually.\n\nAnd whether you work in the public or private sector, even if you do have a conversation with your manager there's no guarantee that it will result in a pay rise.\n\nHowever, there are ways to give yourself the best chance of success.\n\nWe spoke to recruiters, a manager and a workplace psychologist to get five tips on how to best negotiate for more money.\n\nJill Cotton, a career trends experts at jobs site Glassdoor, says scheduling a talk in advance will allow you and your boss time to prepare, and means you're more likely to have a productive conversation.\n\n\"Don't spring this on your line manager,\" Ms Cotton says. \"Be upfront and say that you want to book in a conversation that is specifically about pay.\"\n\nRowsonara Begum, who helps her brother run Saffron Indian takeaway in Salisbury, says it also needs to be the right time for the business.\n\nThe takeaway has five members of staff and occasionally takes on additional workers during busy periods.\n\nRowsonara Begum says workers seeking a pay rise should ask at a good time\n\nShe says if workers pick a time when the business is doing well, they will have the best chance of successfully negotiating more money.\n\nIf you're asking for a pay rise, you should have lots of evidence of why you deserve one.\n\n\"Know what you've achieved either from a work setting or what you've done to develop yourself, maybe to support your team, support your line managers. List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.\n\nThis evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.\n\n\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.\n\nHowever, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.\n\n\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"\n\nWhen asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.\n\nThat's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.\n\n\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.\n\n\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"\n\nOften people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".\n\nWomen and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.\n\nHer advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.\n\nMost experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.\n\nDo your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.\n\n\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.\n\nMs Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.\n\n\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.\n\nIf the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.\n\n\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.\n\nPay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.\n\n\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.\n\nAnd if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.\n\n\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.", "Death Valley, California, hit a US record of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.6C) in 1913.

These are among the new finds being turned up at the Pompeii Archaeological Park.\n\nDig anywhere in the ancient city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in AD79 and you will unearth a treasure - a snapshot of a lost Roman world.\n\nIt's extraordinary to think that one-third of the city buried under pumice and ash has yet to be excavated.\n\n\"Much of that will be for future generations,\" says Alessandro Russo, the co-lead archaeologist on the new dig.\n\n\"We have a problem to conserve what we've already found. Future generations may have new ideas, new techniques.\"\n\nThe latest work returns to a sector in the park last explored in the late 19th Century.\n\nBack then, archaeologists had opened up the frontage of houses on Via Di Nola, one of Pompeii's main thoroughfares, but hadn't delved far behind.\n\nThey had identified a laundry but that was about it.\n\nExcavation work under way in the searing summer heat, in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius\n\nNow, the diggers are progressively pulling away the volcanic ash and pea-sized stones, known as lapilli, that smothered Pompeii during the two catastrophic days of the Vesuvian eruption.\n\nThe dig site is, in effect, a whole city block. It is known as an insula and is some 3,000 sq m (32,000 sq ft) in size.\n\nBBC News has been given exclusive access to the investigation with Lion TV, which is making a three-part series to be aired early next year on the BBC.\n\nThe giant oven could have baked 100 loaves of bread daily\n\n\"Every room in every house has its own micro-story in the grander story of Pompeii. I want to uncover those micro-stories,\" says Gennaro Iovino.\n\nThe other co-lead archaeologist wants you to imagine that you are entering a delightful atrium - an entrance hall - with a hole in the roof where lion figureheads direct rainwater down onto a fountain, next to a statue.\n\nThe builders were clearly doing some repairs at the time of the eruption because the roof tiles are neatly stacked in two piles. But this is not a magnificent villa, like some of the imposing homes found elsewhere in Pompeii.\n\nThis building would have been part-commercial because, on turning right, you are confronted by a giant oven, big enough to be producing 100 loaves a day.\n\nRoughly 50 bakeries have already been found in Pompeii. This, however, can't have been a shop because there is no shop front.\n\nIt's more likely to have been a wholesaler, distributing bread across town, perhaps to the many fast-food joints for which Pompeii was so famous.\n\nThe discovery of a fresco depicting a piece of round flatbread on a silver tray, accompanied by pomegranate, dates, nuts and arbutus fruits, caused a sensation when it was announced to the world in June.\n\nIt's not a pizza, though. Tomatoes and mozzarella, two ingredients in the classic Neapolitan recipe, were not available in Italy in the first century AD.\n\nPerhaps it's a piece of focaccia? The pizza thing started as a bit of a joke, says Gennaro. \"I emailed a picture to my boss, saying 'first the oven, now the pizza'.\"\n\nWith Naples - the home of pizza - a short distance away, the discovery naturally caused a sensation\n\nThe world just went crazy after that. A cover will soon be built over the fresco to try to protect it from the elements.\n\nThe 20,000 visitors who come to Pompeii every day will demand to see the \"ancestor to the pizza\", as some are now describing the fresco subject.\n\nFor the moment, the skeletons are being kept in a specially constructed store room\n\nIt's easy to forget that Pompeii was a human tragedy. We have little idea how many died. You have to believe most residents left when they saw the horror unfolding at the top of Vesuvius.\n\nSkeletons have been recovered, perhaps 1,300 to 1,500 in total, and the new dig has its own examples: two women and a child of unknown sex.\n\nA ball joint at the top of a human thigh bone (femur)\n\nLooking at where the victims were found, it's obvious that they were trying to take cover, hoping that by hiding under a staircase, they would be safe.\n\nWhat they hadn't counted on was the roof collapsing from the weight of all the lapilli and ash. The heavy stonework smashed their bodies.\n\nThe drama of those momentous days in October AD79 are also revealed on the other side of the atrium in what was once a bedroom.\n\nThe bed itself is a charred mass - caused by a fire. It is barely recognisable apart from its broad outline seared into the walls and floor.\n\nThe bedroom might have caught fire when a lamp was knocked over in the panic to escape the eruption\n\nIf you look closely at the debris, you can see blackened fragments of the textile bedclothes and even the filling from the mattress.\n\nA fragment of what is left of the mattress\n\nArchaeologists can tell from the position of these carbonised remains that the fire occurred relatively early in the eruption. They speculate that a lamp might have been knocked over in the panic to get out.\n\n\"It would be interesting to understand who were the people that didn't make it,\" wonders park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel.\n\nWall paintings that look like modern-day wallpaper - \"We're always looking for a surprise,\" says Gabriel Zuchtriegel\n\n\"Were they the poor? More women than men? Or maybe people who had property and tried to stay to protect what they had, while others who had nothing just took off and ran.\"\n\nTowards the back of the area so far excavated there is a wall that encloses three rooms. It's here that the removal of lapilli and ash has exposed more astonishing artwork.\n\nIn the middle room, covered by a tarpaulin, is yet another elegant fresco. It shows the episode in the myth of Achilles where the legendary hero soldier - with his unfortunate Achilles heel - tried to hide dressed as a woman to avoid fighting in the Trojan War.\n\nIn the third room, I pull back another tarp to reveal a magnificent shrine. Two yellow serpents in relief slither up a burgundy background. \"These are good demons,\" says Alessandro. He points to a fresco further down the wall just above an opening to a box of some kind.\n\n\"This room is actually a kitchen. They would have made offerings here to their gods. Foods like fish or fruits. The snake is a connection between the gods and the humans.\"\n\nAs the insula is further revealed, scaffolding is being put up around what remains of the buildings to make protective roofing. In the future, the park hopes to erect a high walkway so tourists can see the new treasures that are emerging.\n\n\"People sometimes ask [us], 'What would you like to find? What are you looking for?'\" explains Gabriel. He says such questions are misleading.\n\n\"What we're really looking for is what we don't know. We're always looking for a surprise. It's all emerging evidence, leading us somewhere, but we don't know where that journey goes.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Tony Jolliffe.

The BBC's Russia Editor gets to grips with the latest twist in the Wagner saga.\n\nSo, let me get this straight.\n\nOn the morning of 24 June, the day of the mutiny, Vladimir Putin accused the Wagner leadership of \"treachery\" and \"a stab in the back\". Later that day, Russian air force pilots were killed, shot down by Wagner fighters.\n\nThen, with the mercenaries just 200km (120 miles) from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and Wagner did a deal. The mutiny was over. No-one was arrested. No-one has been prosecuted.\n\nNot only was Yevgeny Prigozhin not clapped in irons and hauled off to the police station for his rebellion - it's now emerged that five days later he was in the Kremlin, together with his commanders, sitting round the table and chatting with President Putin.\n\nYet another twist and turn in a story that's already surpassed Dostoyevsky for levels of surprise and mystery.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Where is Yevgeny Prigozhin? And why does it matter?\n\nWhat we don't know, though, is what exactly was said at that meeting and how it concluded. Judging by what's happened since, this was no \"kiss and make up\".\n\nIn recent days, the Russian state media has been working overtime to discredit Mr Prigozhin.\n\nPotentially embarrassing photographs allegedly taken during the raid of his St Petersburg mansion were leaked to social media and Russian TV. They showed gold bars, weapons and - bizarrely - a large collection of wigs.\n\nLast night Russia-1's flagship show, News of the Week, continued the character assassination.\n\nA report about Mr Prigozhin claimed: \"He's not the Robin Hood he tried to pass himself off as. He was a businessman with a criminal past. Many of his projects were dodgy and not always within the law.\"\n\nAnd what of that deal between the Kremlin and Wagner to end the mutiny on 24 June? According to the agreement, Mr Prigozhin was supposed to leave Russia for Belarus, along with those Wagner fighters who expressed the desire to join him.\n\nLast week the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, told us that the Wagner chief and his mercenaries weren't there. To summarise his point: they might end up in Belarus - but they might not.\n\nSo that's all clear then. Not.\n\nWhere are Wagner? Where is Mr Prigozhin? What are their plans? What have they agreed with Mr Putin?\n\nFor now, all I can say is this: stay tuned for the next (inevitably bizarre) episode of Russia: the June Mutiny and the Kremlin.", "Umbrellas to ward off the heat in Seville this week\n\nSpain recorded its hottest ever temperature for April on Thursday, hitting 38.8C according to the country's meteorological service.\n\nThe record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain just after 15:00 local time (14:00 BST).\n\nFor days a blistering heatwave has hit the country with temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April.\n\nIt's been driven by a mass of very hot air from Africa, coupled with a slow moving weather system.\n\n\"This is not normal. Temperatures are completely out of control this year,\" Cayetano Torres, a spokesman for Spain's meteorological office, told BBC News.\n\nExperts were surprised by the scale of the heat experienced across southern Spain in recent days.\n\n\"This heat event in Spain is absolutely extreme, unprecedented with temperatures never seen before in April. In some locations records are being beaten by a 5C margin, which is something that has happened only a handful of times at weather stations around the world,\" said Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who runs an Extreme Temperatures twitter account.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Why is it so hot in Spain this week?\n\nSchools will be allowed to adapt their timetables to avoid the worst of the heat. The Madrid underground has trains passing more frequently than usual in order to prevent long waits on the platform, and public swimming pools are expected to open a month earlier than normal.\n\nCristina Linares, a scientist at the Carlos III Health Institute, warned in particular of the impact on the poor.\n\n\"Poverty is the key factor when it comes to explaining why there are more deaths associated with extreme temperatures. Income is the factor with the closest link to the impact of heat on day-to-day deaths.\"\n\nHeatwaves are also striking many locations globally as climate change exacerbates naturally high temperatures.\n\nWhile parts of Britain are cooler than average right now, the opposite is the case in many regions of Spain.\n\nMeteorologists say that a combination of factors is responsible for the exceptional temperatures being seen there this week.\n\nHot weather across North Africa is pushing heat into Europe. A high pressure weather system plus clear skies over the Iberian peninsula are allowing more sunshine to hit the ground, which is already so dry it can't evaporate the heat.\n\nThe high temperatures come on top of long running drought in many parts of Spain. Reservoirs in the Guadalquivir basin are only at 25% of capacity.\n\nThis combination is raising the prospect of early forest fires, with the national weather service warning that large swathes of the country would be at risk. Spain saw the most land burned of any country in Europe in 2022.\n\nClimate change is very likely playing a role in this heatwave, according to experts in the field.\n\n\"We know that 2022 was the second warmest year on record for Europe, and it was the warmest summer on record,\" Dr Samantha Burgess from the Copernicus climate change service told BBC News.\n\n\"Europe is warming at twice the global rate and we know because there is a higher rate of warming, there's a higher probability of extreme events. And those extreme events include heat waves.\"\n\nAs well as the impact on young and old, another concern is agriculture.\n\nMany farmers are experiencing difficulties due to the ongoing lack of rain, with the government in Madrid asking the European Union for financial help.\n\nSome landowners say they won't plant crops due to the dry conditions, which could have implications for food supplies across Europe.\n\nThis heatwave in Spain is not an isolated event - all across the world high temperatures in the first few months of this year have shattered records.\n\nReservoirs are low in many parts of Spain thanks to a long running drought\n\nEight countries in central and eastern Europe set new all time highs for the warmest January weather on the very first day of this year.\n\nCountries across Asia have seen extreme heat in recent weeks. In northwest Thailand, the temperature hit 45.4C on 15 April, while in Laos it reached 42.7C.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the capital Dhaka saw the mercury rise above 40C, believed to be the hottest day in 58 years.\n\nAnother factor likely to influence weather across the world over the coming months is the likely onset of an El Ni\u00f1o event.\n\nThis will see more heat emerge in the Pacific ocean off the coast of Peru. If it happens, then 2024 might emerge as the world's warmest year on record, with more storms, fires and floods.\n\n\"It seems we are living in a world of a new normal here,\" said Dr Fahad Saeed, from research organisation, Climate Analytics.\n\n\"These people in regions like Asia are the people who have been adapting to these kinds of extreme temperatures for thousands of years, but its is now getting beyond their ability to adapt.\"\n\n\"That's why we are witnessing rising death rates due to heat each year in this part of the world.\"", "Ivan Holtvenko holds his old Azovstal ID card as he talks\n\nOne year after the Ukrainian city of Mariupol fell to Russian control, its displaced steel workers find themselves both comforted and unsettled by ghosts of their former lives.\n\nIvan Holtvenko clutches his ID card from his old job in the southern port city as he chats to me in his new workplace, a steelworks in central Ukraine.\n\n\"I hid the pass [when I fled], and now I'm saving it, hoping that one day I'll need it again,\" he says.\n\nIvan is among dozens of workers from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks who have begun a new life in Kamianske, 270km [168 miles] away, after surviving the final battle for Mariupol, one of the most defining moments of the war.\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the tunnels and bunkers of the steelworks, making a last stand against the Russian forces. They were eventually forced to leave, but Azovstal became a symbol of resistance against the invasion.\n\nAzovstal - with its maze of underground tunnels - was attacked for weeks in early 2022\n\nIvan has no idea if, or when, Ukraine will retake Mariupol. But he yearns for his old life.\n\nWhen former Azovstal workers bump into each other in the shelters, hallways, offices and factory floor of their new workplace, they connect over their lost lives. Some have nicknamed themselves the \"Mariupol diaspora\".\n\n\"When you meet someone from Mariupol you get that feeling inside,\" repairs engineer Oleksandr Shabanov says, smiling.\n\nManagers at the new steel factory say there are about 120 former Azovstal staff there, as well as more from another Mariupol plant.\n\nWorkers reminisce about summers spent at the beach, fishing trips and the sea views in their industrial home city. Two say they were in the process of building holiday homes together when Russia invaded.\n\nThey talk of Facebook groups that have now gone quiet. Some of their former colleagues have moved to other parts of Ukraine or abroad. Others have been killed. Many more are missing.\n\n\"We don't know what's happened to him,\" a group of Mariupol workers say as they talk about one former colleague and friend.\n\nOf the 10,500 staff at Azovstal, managers say fewer than half are accounted for.\n\nThe Mariupol workers remember a time when they weren't scared of war, joking that people there have a reputation for being tough.\n\nFighting first broke out in the city in 2014, and the government briefly lost control after clashes with pro-Russian militants and protesters. But the workers say they never thought it would fall, as it did last year following a lengthy siege.\n\nMariupol was in a strategic location for the Russian invasion, linking as it does Crimea and Donbas, and the brutal battle for its control lasted more than 80 days.\n\nIts theatre, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, was bombed, its maternity hospital badly damaged in a Russian strike.\n\nIvan said nothing had prepared them for this.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be a crisis we could live through, just as we did in 2014,\" he tells me.\n\nAs is the case with other members of the Mariupol diaspora, Ivan's home was destroyed during the siege. The building and everything inside it is now just a memory - family photos, clothes, furniture.\n\n\"Everything got burnt,\" he says.\n\nBut while Ivan and other colleagues draw strength from their community, for others it only exacerbates their trauma.\n\n\"How can anything comfort me?\" says engineer Ihor Khadzhava.\n\n\"There is nothing good about ending up here\u2026 and nowhere to go back to. There's no plant, no work, nowhere to live, just hate.\"\n\nResidents who have remained in Mariupol say Moscow has brought in labourers from across Russia and Central Asia to rebuild the city, but not as it was - streets have had their Soviet names restored, new buildings have appeared and many of those damaged in the siege have gone. Russian flags have been erected as well as pro-Russia billboards and posters.\n\nThe Russian rouble is now the only currency accepted in shops there, and re-opened schools in the city are teaching a Russian-language curriculum. Residents are under pressure to get Russian passports.\n\nIhor is now resigned to accepting whatever fate might bring. When sirens ring out at the factory to warn of a possible Russian attack, he keeps working.\n\nHe hasn't used a shelter since the two months he spent underground in the bunker at Azovstal last year.\n\nIhor Khadzhava and his daughter in the Azovstal shelter\n\n\"What's the use?\" the 39-year-old says blankly.\n\nFor the former Azovstal workers who do use the shelters, there are memories even underground.\n\nOleksandr takes a photo on his phone and sends it to his wife Yuliia.\n\n\"No kidding. It really looks the same,\" she replies.\n\nBeing in the near-identical bunker can be traumatic, Oleksandr says.\n\n\"The point of the shelter is not to feel frightened. When you go down it's the safest place\u2026 but in the back of my mind there is this fear,\" he says.\n\nIn Mariupol, an estimated 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed during the siege by the Russian forces, and about 350,000 of the population of almost half a million were forced to leave.\n\nBack then, Oleksandr and Yuliia had sought shelter in Azovstal's Soviet-era bunkers after fleeing their ninth-floor apartment - a shell had hit a neighbouring building, spraying shrapnel through their window.\n\nThe couple grabbed food, clothing, identification documents, their cat Mason and a 2kg bag of pet food, before running to Azovstal as shells landed around them.\n\nIn the shelter, they slept on wooden pallets and divided up tasks to stay busy - guarding the exits, cooking meals, cleaning.\n\nWhen supplies were running low, Yuliia would draw the children pictures of their favourite foods so they could pretend to eat them. They dreamed of burgers and sausages.\n\nOleksandr and Yuliia remember Ihor's daughter making a \"squeaky noise like a siren\" when she came to stroke Mason, while another child, whose own pets had been left at home, sang to him each night: \"Mason, Mason, you're a king of cats\".\n\nThere were other pets in the shelter - a pug would sometimes run around frantically as missiles landed overhead.\n\nThe shelter's occupants had no idea how long they would be there. Sometimes they wondered if they would ever see daylight again.\n\nKamianske is in a much safer location than Mariupol - further inland and on the west side of the Dnipro River, which acts as a natural buffer.\n\nBut workers say that Russia's siege of Mariupol, and the important role the Azovstal bunker played in keeping some of them safe, has taught them the importance of being prepared.\n\nIn the shelter at the Kamianske steelworks, Oleksandr, Ivan and others wait behind thick metal doors to be given the all-clear to resurface. Smaller side rooms contain toilets, an examination bed and medical equipment, stacks of water bottles, jars and tins of food, phones and computers, and a generator.\n\n\"We understand that it's not only about sheltering, but also about having things that are most needed in those situations,\" Ivan explains.\n\n\"Is there a place to sit? What if there are wounded in the group? Is everything OK with the electricity? What about internet connection? Warm clothes? Food?\"\n\nBut no amount of preparation can completely allay their fears.\n\n\"Of course, we can joke and say 'we are from Mariupol, nothing scares us', but actually every time you hear the sirens you get very uncomfortable and really want it to end,\" Ivan says.\n\nBecause of course, the last time the Mariupol workers saw their home city, it was under attack.\n\nSome people remained in the city because they were unable to leave, due to illness or old age, while others welcomed Russia's presence.\n\nBut the workers we spoke to in Kamianske said they would not consider returning to the city while it remains under Russian occupation.\n\n\"No matter how much the Russians try to hide it under construction, those are still ruins,\" Ihor's wife Karyna says of her home city.\n\nWith no sea to look out to, Oleksandr and Yuliia now take regular trips to the Dnipro River, hoping it will instil feelings of calm. But, they say, it's not the same.\n\nFor now the Mariupol diaspora, like many displaced Ukrainians, are trying to adapt to a life in limbo.

It is a key demand from Kyiv that President Zelensky reiterated: \"There can be no peace at the expense of territorial compromises.\"\n\nCritics have also questioned the idea of Beijing acting as a mediator, citing not only Mr Xi's firm friendship with Russia's leader but also China's soaring trade with Russia and its refusal even to speak of an \"invasion\".\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow saw \"broad concord\" with China's approach but said the main barrier was Kyiv's \"unrealistic demands\". Moscow's own demands include recognition of its annexation of swathes of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which was invaded in 2014.\n\nChina's 12-point plan to end the war has been widely criticised by Ukraine and the West. It fails to offer clear plans for Ukraine's future security or for territory seized by Russia and includes a proposal for unilateral sanctions to be dropped.\n\nAnd yet Wednesday's hour-long call did not come as a complete surprise.\n\nEarlier this month, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said that Mr Xi had spoken of his willingness to talk to Ukraine's leader when the \"conditions and time are right\". She had joined French President Emmanuel Macron on a visit to Beijing.\n\nPresident Zelensky has repeatedly reached out to the Chinese president, an acknowledgement that China's vast wealth and global influence could swing the outcome of the war.\n\nIn its readout of the call, Beijing announced its willingness to engage directly with Ukraine, by sending a special representative on Eurasian affairs to Kyiv and other capitals for \"in-depth communication\" on a political settlement.\n\nFor his part, Mr Zelensky appointed a former minister, Pavlo Ryabikin, as ambassador to Beijing.\n\nXi Jinping has had recent diplomatic success by persuading Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore ties. While it is possible he may have developed a taste for the role of a key international stakeholder, there may also be an economic element to his intervention.\n\nChina's flagging economy is still fragile after years of tight Covid-19 restrictions. It is dependent on export trade and cannot fully bounce back as the war in Ukraine drags on.\n\nNews of the phone-call made headline news in China's carefully controlled state media outlets, which printed China's interpretation of the call.\n\nOn Chinese social media sites, users appeared supportive, with many calling for peaceful dialogue and supporting what they saw as China acting like a responsible country.\n\n\"China must break the deadlock and melt the ice!\" read one typical comment.\n\u2022 None End of Ukraine war no closer after Putin-Xi talks", "If accepted, the deal could draw a year-long dispute between Royal Mail and the CWU to a close\n\nRoyal Mail and union negotiators have reached an agreement which could signal the end of a long-running pay dispute.\n\nThe postal company and the Communication Workers Union have reached an \"in principle\" agreement over pay and employment terms.\n\nThe CWU's executive will meet next week to consider the deal, which if accepted, will then be voted on by union members.\n\nFor the past year there has been a row over workers' pay, jobs and conditions.\n\nDetails of the agreement are expected to be released next week.\n\nThe joint statement said: \"After almost a year of talks, Royal Mail and the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) are pleased to announce they have reached a negotiators' agreement in principle.\n\n\"The proposed agreement will now be considered by the executive of the union before being voted on by the union's membership.\n\nCWU general secretary Dave Ward and deputy general secretary Andy Furey said: \"On the basis that the negotiators' agreement is endorsed by the postal executive, we will put in place a full communications plan to engage members.\n\n\"Thank you for your support and patience.

Roberts, David Gareth Davies and Dewi Prysor Williams were all arrested after being filmed at a protest march in uniform.\n\nSion Aubrey Roberts was cleared of being part of the Meibion Glyndwr movement, a charge that would have carried a longer prison sentence\n\nJanuary 1993 saw the three men appear at Caernarfon Crown Court for what would eventually be a 40-day trial.\n\nProsecutors said Roberts had been seen in forensic clothing and assembling devices, but the defence questioned the accuracy of surveillance and found inconsistencies in MI5 reports.\n\nAll three were found not guilty of the conspiracy, but a jury did find Roberts guilty of sending four incendiary devices in the post and possession of explosive substances. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\n\"You have to be ready to go to jail before you start,\" he said.\n\n\"If I'd been convicted of conspiracy, I'd have got 25 years. I thought I'd be out in eight years, that isn't too bad.\"\n\nNo Meibion Glyndwr attack has happened since Roberts' conviction.\n\nHe was eight when the firebombings started, and so was not a ringleader.

However he said he had no regrets and stressed lessons needed to be learned.\n\nThe next witness to give evidence was Jane Morrison, whose wife Jacky died from Covid.

Yet, after shorter assessments online, three private clinics have told me I do - and offered me powerful medication.\n\n\"You fit the criteria for ADHD very well. You'll have it in writing, officially that you have been diagnosed. There is no expiration date for this. You were diagnosed for life,\" says the psychologist through the computer screen, as I sit at my kitchen table.\n\nI am working undercover, using my middle name James, to investigate private clinics that can offer ADHD assessments at a time when NHS waiting times have risen, in some areas, to more than five years.\n\nThe assessment over Zoom, with a clinic called Harley Psychiatrists, costs \u00a3685 and takes 45 minutes. As my assessor asks her quick-fire questions, she appears to be slouched on a sofa wearing a tracksuit top.\n\n\"Did I have problems concentrating at school?\"\n\nI try my best to answer but the screen keeps wobbling as she struggles to get comfortable. The whole time she plays with her hair and I get the sense she isn't focusing completely.\n\nAt the end, she diagnoses me with ADHD - a lifelong condition. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with symptoms falling into two categories - inattentiveness, plus hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\n\nStunned, all I can say back to my assessor is: \"It's a lot to take in.\"\n\nThings were very different when I met Dr Mike Smith, a consultant psychiatrist who leads a specialist adult ADHD service in the NHS. I told him about my investigation and he said he also had concerns about how some private providers were operating. He agreed to show me how an assessment should be carried out.\n\nAhead of the appointment at his Leeds clinic, my mum, girlfriend and I were forwarded forms to fill out - collecting information on my habits, from my childhood up to now. They took hours to complete. Dr Smith was even interested in reading my school reports.\n\nHe warned me when I arrived: \"This is going to get very personal. Are you OK with that?\"\n\nIn truth, I wasn't prepared for what followed. I was under the impression I was just going to spend the next couple of hours answering questions about my lack of focus, but Dr Smith wanted to get a full picture of my mental health. I found myself telling him about some of my hardest times.\n\nWhen I was 14, I witnessed the aftermath of my sisters being knocked down by a car. Ailis survived, Claire - who was 11 - died. Almost 17 years to the day, my dad died unexpectedly. I was a different person after those events. The reason I am sharing this is because I was told the effect of such trauma can sometimes manifest itself into symptoms similar to ADHD.\n\n\"You do not have ADHD,\" said NHS consultant Dr Mike Smith\n\nA friend of mine - who had been privately diagnosed with the condition - had once suggested to me that I might have it too. Some of ADHD's recognised symptoms felt uncomfortably familiar - I can forget things, I fidget, I will on occasion zone out of long meetings.\n\nMy social media feeds had been filling up with videos talking about ADHD and I could relate to them. But on the whole, I was dubious about whether they related to me. None of these things seemed to really impact my life.\n\nDr Smith took the time to explore these life-altering moments and the struggles they have caused. He says that when considering the symptoms a patient describes - such as finding it hard to focus - it's important to differentiate between ADHD and other things that may explain them, such as the effects of trauma.\n\nBefore diagnosing someone with ADHD, it is also vital to establish that any symptoms are having a serious impact on their life.\n\n\"I can't see any evidence you've got any serious problem with your concentration, your hyper-activity, or your level of activity, or impulsivity,\" Dr Smith told me, after more than three gruelling hours.\n\nContrast this lengthy deep dive into my life and personality with the consultation I received at Harley Psychiatrists - during which there was no interrogation of how prevalent or serious any of my symptoms were. There were few follow-up questions.\n\nAdmittedly I was relieved I didn't have to go over any of the traumatic experiences in my life again, but I felt like the psychologist had missed some crucial background.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) sets out how individuals should be diagnosed in the UK with ADHD. To meet the threshold, a patient will have a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms, which often include:\n\nDr Smith - the NHS consultant - told me I hadn't met the clinical threshold for any of the 18 symptoms associated with ADHD.\n\nBy comparison, the psychologist who assessed me for Harley Psychiatrists told me I had met the threshold for 15 out of the 18 ADHD symptoms. A week later, I discussed treatment plans with a psychiatrist working for the company. This lasted less than 10 minutes and I was quickly prescribed a stimulant commonly used to treat ADHD. There was also no mention of other treatments, such as talking therapy.\n\nThe medication interacts with chemicals in the brain and can help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive and feel calmer.\n\nThe powerful controlled drug is safe and effective if prescribed properly, but it has the potential to cause serious side effects. ADHD medication can cause insomnia, elevated heart rate and high blood pressure - and in rare cases panic attacks, psychosis and seizures. But the psychiatrists from Harley Psychiatrists simply advised me to have a good breakfast before taking it, without talking through the potential serious side effects.\n\nHarley Psychiatrists' lawyers told the BBC that clinicians also take account of information in pre-assessment forms,. They said: \"diagnosis of ADHD\u2026 depends on the answers given by the patient\" and that there had been \"numerous patients [assessed by the clinic] not diagnosed with ADHD\".\n\n\"The suggestion our client is misdiagnosing adults with ADHD is untrue,\" they said, as was the suggestion that adequate checks were not being conducted.\n\nThe clinic accepts that I \"should not have been able to obtain a prescription\", and has updated its processes.\n\nLawyers for the psychologist who first assessed me said that while her testing had produced results \"indicative of a patient having ADHD\", such a \"diagnosis is formally made by a psychiatrist\".\n\nLawyers for the psychiatrist who prescribed the drugs said their client stood by his diagnosis - and would \"normally take between 30 and 45 minutes\", but in this case he \"did not consider it necessary\" because of the psychologist's report.\n\nI think I'd have felt more reassured if I could have seen both the psychologist and the psychiatrist in person. But this wasn't an option, despite the company website saying its \"main clinic\" was located on Harley Street, central London's prestigious medical neighbourhood.\n\nWhen I later visited the address listed on Harley Psychiatrists' website, I was told over the intercom that there were no psychiatrists on site. Harley later told us it has routinely seen patients at that location, even though it doesn't have a permanent clinic on the site.\n\nThis whole investigation began when Panorama received an email from a concerned mother. She had written to us to say she felt her 21-year-old daughter had been diagnosed too quickly by a private clinic and that it had prescribed her strong drugs with no proper follow-up care.\n\nAs I started to research the subject - speaking to NHS staff, specialists, academics, former patients and whistleblower staff at private clinics - I heard a common refrain.\n\n\"If you're willing to pay for an assessment, you'll get a diagnosis.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine them saying, 'No, you don't have it',\" says former patient Casey\n\nA former Harley Psychiatrists' patient I spoke to - Casey - says she chose the company for the name, its location and positive online reviews. Casey was being treated on the NHS for anxiety, but says after seeing an Instagram post about ADHD she became convinced that she had that too.\n\nPut off by the long NHS waiting lists, she borrowed the money to book a \u00a3685 appointment. Her experience was similar to mine. She was diagnosed in two stages - with a psychologist assessment, followed by a video call with a psychiatrist. The appointments lasted similar lengths of time to mine and she was prescribed stimulant medication at the end.\n\n\"It was kind of like a diagnostic factory,\" she recalls.\n\n\"If I didn't have ADHD,\" she said, \"I can't imagine them saying, 'No, you don't have it.'\"\n\nCasey says her calls and emails were frequently ignored - and yet the clinic was quick to make contact when she posted a negative review online, demanding that she remove it.\n\nThe clinic emailed her saying her \"false review and all other correspondence\" had been passed on to its \"legal department\".\n\nCasey says she felt deeply upset by the experience and - after leaving Harley Psychiatrists - she was signed off work for four months. Since then, Casey has been seeing a different psychiatrist and her care has improved.\n\nLawyers for Harley Psychiatrists say they have never sought the removal of negative reviews that were truthful, only those that they claim contained falsehoods.\n\nMore and more people are turning to private clinics for an assessment to determine whether they have ADHD. Panorama investigates whether some are giving unreliable diagnoses\n\nWatch the full investigation on BBC iPlayer now\n\nIt will be on BBC One on Monday 15 May at 20:00 in England and Scotland, and 20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nBy the time I was booked in for my second private assessment with a company called ADHD 360, I had an idea of what to expect. ADHD 360 is a private provider that has won a number of NHS contracts.\n\nThe government is keen to outsource NHS work to private firms to tackle lengthy waiting times. However, we had been told by patients, former staff and some within the NHS, that there were serious concerns regarding how ADHD 360 assessed people.\n\nIt cost \u00a3950 to be assessed and treated by ADHD 360, and my online assessment - carried out by a pharmacist - was longer than with Harley Psychiatrists, lasting just over an hour. There were more follow-up questions about some of the answers I had given, but it did not feel thorough.\n\nAt one point, I did mention that my sister had died, but the clinician - who seemed to be uncomfortable by what I just said - moved on quickly. There was also an interlude as we discussed our favourite Leeds United players.\n\nThe assessor totted up my scores from what appeared to be a checklist of symptoms, confirmed that I met the criteria for ADHD, and proceeded to prescribe a higher dose of stimulant medication than had been recommended by Harley Psychiatrists.\n\nADHD 360 told us it is regulated as an NHS provider and delivers \"high standard assessment, diagnosis, treatment and care\" for thousands of patients. Its \"qualified clinicians\" are trained in its own academy and its \"assessments meet all accepted best practices\". It said on this occasion its \"prescription policy was regrettably not followed\", and \"procedures have now been reviewed\" and enhanced.\n\nMy final online assessment - with ADHD Direct in Glasgow - cost \u00a31,095 and was conducted by a nurse. She was new, and so was being supervised by another nurse. The assessment was a little longer - one hour and 40 minutes - and I had a follow-up appointment three weeks later to get my results.\n\nOnce again, I was told I had ADHD and offered stimulant medication, but this time I told the clinic I was a reporter before I got my prescription.\n\nLawyers for ADHD Direct told us there would have been more checks before I was prescribed any drugs - and that the clinic stood by its diagnosis and had carried out a \"full developmental and psychiatric history\".\n\nA company audit had shown that 10% of patients seen did not have ADHD and that there was \"no incentive\u2026 to over-diagnose\" - they said.\n\nSo despite having had a comprehensive NHS assessment carried out by a consultant psychiatrist which concluded that I don't have ADHD - I now also had three private diagnoses saying the opposite.\n\nThere's no doubt that many people who go private will have ADHD.\n\nBut my investigation shows how some clinics hand out unreliable diagnoses - and that can put vulnerable patients at risk.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.", "Southampton 0-2 Fulham: Aleksandar Mitrovic scores on return from ban as Saints relegated from Premier League Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic reached a career-high top-flight tally of 12 goals with Fulham's second at Southampton Southampton's 11-year stay in the Premier League ended in tame fashion as their relegation was confirmed with defeat at home by Fulham. Aleksandar Mitrovic, making his return from an eight-game ban for pushing referee Chris Kavanagh, sealed Saints' fate with a stooping header after Carlos Vinicius' opener. The hosts could have few complaints about the outcome after producing a muted performance despite knowing they had to win to have any chance of pulling off an unlikely survival mission. They did have a Carlos Alcaraz strike disallowed for a marginal offside just before Vinicius broke the deadlock but the confident Cottagers were comfortably the better side. Willian's first-half volley was cleared off the line by fellow Brazilian Lyanco, who had earlier been fortunate to escape a video assistant referee's penalty check for handball. But Vinicius tucked home after Lyanco's clearance ricocheted to him kindly off Harrison Reed and Mitrovic nodded in his 12th league goal of the season from Harry Wilson's cross. Southampton, lethargic throughout, had no response after falling behind and will be playing Championship football next season for the first time since 2012.\n\u2022 None Follow reaction from Southampton v Fulham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League action\n\u2022 None Go straight to all the best Southampton content Sorry Saints sink into second tier Ruben Selles - 'Southampton will bounce with or without me' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a Saints supporter, was among those in attendance on Saturday but the clumps of empty seats before kick-off at St Mary's suggested many fans had already conceded the game was up. Their fears were proven right and those vacant chairs numbered thousands at the final whistle, with some of the few who stayed behind voicing their displeasure at interim boss Ruben Selles and his players. Southampton have collected just three points from the past 33 available, slipping into freefall just as a number of their relegation rivals had begun to produce important and, in some cases, unexpected results. Much of the damage was done long before that run, however - Southampton slipped into the relegation places on 6 November after a 4-1 home loss to Newcastle and have remained there ever since. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was among the Southampton fans in attendance for the game against Fulham They sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl a day after that drubbing but the subsequent ill-fated appointment of Nathan Jones as his successor yielded worse results than the Austrian had overseen. The former Luton boss lost seven of his eight league games in charge - the only glimmer of light a 2-1 win at Frank Lampard's then equally hapless Everton. Jones, quickly on thin ice with supporters following home defeats by Brighton and relegation rivals Nottingham Forest, was dismissed after a 2-1 loss to 10-man fellow strugglers Wolves on 11 February. By that time, Saints had hit rock-bottom, sinking to 20th after the Boxing Day defeat by Brighton and staying rooted to the table virtually ever since. Two wins in Selles' first three games in charge - both 1-0 victories, at Stamford Bridge against misfiring Chelsea and at home to fellow drop candidates Leicester - provided a glimmer of hope. But key losses to West Ham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest, as well as letting a 3-1 lead after 88 minutes slip to draw 3-3 at then leaders Arsenal, put paid to any hopes of a great escape. Southampton have spent more than three times as long at the foot of the Premier League in 2022-23 as any other club Southampton's previous absence from the Premier League, after relegation in 2005, lasted seven years and included a two-season dip into League One - both things they will hope to avoid this time. They will almost certainly have to rebound without inspirational skipper James Ward-Prowse, who will have suitors aplenty - although it is a damning indictment on their season and, perhaps, summer recruitment, that it is difficult to pick out too many other obvious saleable assets. Saints could take inspiration from Fulham, twice relegated from the top flight in the past four years but showing signs they can shed that yo-yo tag under Marco Silva. This win lifted last season's Championship title-winners to ninth and all but assured the Cottagers a top-half finish, a deserved reward for the entertaining and attacking brand of football they have produced. While Southampton were enduring a club-record 24th league loss of the season and failing to improve on their all-time low home haul of 10 points, from 54 available so far, Fulham were setting happier milestones. This was their 15th Premier League win of the campaign - a record high for the club, as was a seventh top-flight away victory, and they also equalled their highest goal tally of 52 from 2003-04 and 2004-05.\n\u2022 None Attempt saved.

Marsh has 31 and Cameron Green three.\n\nWith more bad weather forecast for Sunday, England are left hoping for enough time to force the win that would level the series at 2-2 and turn the fifth Test at The Oval into a decider.\n\nThough victory is now almost out of the question for Australia, a draw would be enough for them to retain the urn.\n\u2022 None How day four at Old Trafford unfolded\n\u2022 None England will win 3-2 if they win fourth Test - Vaughan\n\nThis series has produced three thrilling Tests, with the drama in the fourth now coming through England's battle with the weather. It would be a huge anti-climax if the rain has a decisive say in the destination of the Ashes urn.\n\nEngland were fortunate to get any play on Saturday. Overnight rain persisted into the morning and early afternoon, but the ground was readied at a remarkable speed. The empty stands filled rapidly as news of a start filtered through.\n\nThough the overheads were ideal and the crowd expectant, England were blocked by an unresponsive surface - there was no sign of the uneven bounce from earlier in the match - and the determination of Labuschagne and Marsh.\n\nThe reverse swing of Friday evening also disappeared as the ball became wet. When England persuaded the umpires to change it and looked to bring Mark Wood into the attack, they were told the light was not fit enough for pace. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as Root proved to be the most threatening bowler.\n\nEngland will return on Sunday wishing for the weather to be kind. There is the possibility of 98 overs of play and second new ball available nine overs into the day.\n\nFor Australia, they will not only be looking to repel England, but also build a lead to make the hosts' route to victory longer. Their inclusion of both Marsh and Green in this Test, extending the batting line-up, was done partly with this scenario in mind.\n\nLabuschagne delivers when Australia need it most\n\nThis has been a difficult series for Labuschagne. Beginning ranked as the world's number one Test batter, he had not managed a half-century before this match.\n\nHe hinted at a return to form with 51 in the first innings and then delivered what could yet prove to be an Ashes-saving hundred.\n\nWith Australia 113-4 overnight, Labuschagne began on 44 and Marsh one. Though Labuschagne took a painful blow on the finger from a Wood bouncer, he was largely untroubled by England's short-ball plan.\n\nMarsh, usually so aggressive, was a calm foil. He has struck only four fours in a 107-ball stay and two of those came in successive deliveries from Chris Woakes, who spent time off the field suffering from stiffness.\n\nWhen Root came on, Labuschagne lofted two sixes over long-on, but also flashed an edge off an arm-ball past slip Zak Crawley when he was on 93.\n\nHe went to his 11th Test ton by pinching a single off Moeen Ali before making an error attempting to cut Root and was given out on review.\n\nGiven the stakes and urgency of the situation, this was a curiously flat performance from England's seamers.\n\nThey got little movement from the ball or the pitch and chewed up precious time as they deliberated over field placings and tactics.\n\nA bouncer plan achieved little other than knocking the ball out of shape, after which came the stroke of luck with Wood being denied the chance to bowl, resulting in the call to Moeen and Root.\n\nWhile Moeen mixed some dangerous bounce with regular loose deliveries, Root constantly made things happen.\n\nHe was convinced on-field umpire Nitin Menon had made a mistake for the Labuschagne wicket, celebrating towards the Party Stand even before the review was complete. In the same over, an inside edge off Marsh went in and out of the fingers of bat-pad fielder Harry Brook.\n\nGreen survived a review off Moeen from the final ball before the tea break. England would have been happy to bowl more spin after the interval, only to be denied the opportunity.\n\nAustralia batter Marnus Labuschagne, speaking to BBC Sport: \"It's always very special getting a Test hundred. It doesn't happen too often but I'm disappointed I couldn't get us to tea.\n\n\"We were so close to having a tremendous day there. For us, this is about saving this Test match and retaining the Ashes.\"\n\nEngland batting coach Marcus Trescothick: \"We got more play than we expected. It looked like a complete washout so it's a bonus. We're one wicket closer but it's still frustrating.\n\n\"It really does depend on the weather. We wanted to get two or three wickets today and we'll take any play we can tomorrow.\"\n\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: \"England were a bit flat.

He started asking bizarre questions about someone watching us,\" said Sharon.\n\nFleet also began taking knives to bed with him and trying to light small fires in his bedroom.\n\n\"Eventually he said to me that he thought he might have to kill someone because 'people are watching us, there was hidden cameras everywhere and nowhere is safe' - that was when I said he had to come with me to hospital,\" said Sharon.\n\n\"We had to prise the knife off him to get him into the car and get him into hospital.\"\n\nSharon Lees wants the health board to say sorry to her, her son and Lewis Stone's family\n\nIn October 2018, Fleet was detained under the Mental Health Act, but when he was allowed home for visits, Sharon said she warned hospital staff he was still buying cannabis and looking for knives.\n\nAfter four months as an in-patient, staff decided he should be treated at home.\n\n\"I just cried because I just don't know how I'm going to cope... he's over 6ft tall, I can't stop him from going out,\" said Sharon.\n\nEarly on 28 February 2019, 10 days after being sent home, Fleet left the house with a knife.\n\nLewis Stone's family say David Fleet \"took away their beloved hero\"\n\n\"I'm trying to phone him, trying to message him... I looked out of the back window and I could see the air ambulance. I just remember having this really sinking feeling. Like I knew,\" she said.\n\nFleet had never met his victim before that day.\n\nMr Stone, from Staffordshire, was walking his dog Jock along the bank of the River Leri while visiting his nearby holiday home which he and his wife had plans to retire to.\n\nFleet later told psychiatrists if he had not stabbed Mr Stone, the voices in his head \"were going to kill him\".\n\nFamily of Mr Stone - who died in hospital three months after the attack - said their lives changed in the \"most horrific, heart-breaking\" way.\n\nThey said the \"old-fashioned gentleman\", who was \"adored\" by his wife, children and grandchildren, would have been \"defenceless\".\n\nLewis Stone was stabbed when out walking near Borth Wild Animal Kingdom\n\nBBC Wales Investigates has seen a copy of an internal health board report into David's care prior to the attack.\n\nIt reveals that three weeks before the stabbing, a doctor had warned he was not ready to leave hospital because of his \"worsening mental state\" and the risks he posed with knives.\n\nJust days later, he was sent home without anyone updating his risk assessment and staff were meant to contact him the day before the attack, but did not because of their workload.\n\nHe also did not receive a dose of his anti-psychotic medication.\n\nDavid pleaded guilty to Mr Stone's manslaughter due to diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely at a secure psychiatric unit on 16 September 2019.\n\nMr Stone's family said there was \"no excuse or forgiveness\" for David and \"nothing could be said or done to help them understand or move on from what's happened\".\n\nThey agreed there were \"huge failings in the mental health sector\" to have \"such a monster released and walking the streets, able to cause such harm\" and want David Fleet to remain locked up.\n\nStudies by the University of Manchester suggest between 2010 and 2020 there were 5,876 homicide offenders in the UK, of which 610 (11%) were under the care of mental health services.\n\nWhile there was a fall in the overall homicide rate in England and Wales since 2008, the percentage of homicides carried out by people with schizophrenia actually increased.\n\nResearchers said drug and alcohol misuse were known to elevate risk.\n\nThe Welsh government has the power to commission independent mental health homicide reviews and share lessons as widely as possible, but BBC Wales Investigates has discovered that since 2016, it has stopped asking for them.\n\nThis mean lessons from this and three other killings involving mentally ill people in Wales in that time have not been shared.\n\nLord Alex Carlile, a former MP and a barrister with decades of experience in homicide cases is critical of the \"failure\" to share information in David's case.\n\n\"It is absolutely dreadful. It is essential that in cases where there is a major safeguarding issue, information should be shared by all the relevant public and private sector organisations,\" he said.\n\nHe also said, the Welsh government should have commissioned independent reviews into other mental health homicides in this time, calling it a \"seven-year scandal\".\n\nLewis Stone died three months after being stabbed while taking his dog for a walk in February 2019\n\nThe Welsh government's decision means that, four years on from the killing, Mr Stone's family have not been able to see information about the missed opportunities to monitor Fleet.\n\nHywel Dda health board said it shared its internal report into Fleet's care with some of its own staff and the Welsh government but could not publish it because it contained confidential medical information.\n\nIn a private letter, Sharon was told it had subsequently made changes to its services, but she believes that, had details and lessons been shared with other health boards, it could potentially have prevented other killings.\n\nThe Welsh government said it was \"satisfied\" it had not needed to commission independent mental health homicide reviews since 2016 because health boards had been \"thorough\" when investigating their own cases.\n\nHowever, it did admit the wider review system needed to change to ensure better \"communication and coordination\" so it was introducing the Single Unified Safeguarding Review.\n\nA spokesman added: \"This new approach eliminates the need for families to take part in multiple, often onerous and traumatising, reviews and will more quickly identify learning, build a greater understanding of what happened during an incident and why, and provide a clear action plan to improve services.\"\n\nSharon believes her son was let down by mental health services, leaving two families \"devastated\" as a result.\n\n\"The feelings of guilt and remorse that David is feeling are incomprehensible,\" she added.\n\nShe now wants the health board to say sorry to her son and Mr Stone's family.\n\n\"It's really important for just not only us, but for Mr Stone's family to have a public apology because of his illness and the lack of care that he received... it only feels justified that he also receives an apology because the health board failed him, which then in turn failed his victim's family.\"", "The Scottish government will meet its pledge to provide free school meals for all primary school children, the deputy first minister has said.\n\nShona Robison said the full rollout that had been due to happen last 2022 will include P6 and P7 pupils by 2024.\n\nBut she confirmed a plan for universal free meals in secondary schools would have to be looked at again.\n\nIt comes after the first minister warned \"tough choices\" needed to be made about existing budgets.\n\nHumza Yousaf said on Tuesday that future Scottish government spending plans would be targeted at those most in need.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Shona Robison backed Mr Yousaf's call for targeted spending to be effectively aimed at reducing poverty.\n\nShe said there was \"no question\" that the commitment to free school meals for P6 and P7 pupils would go ahead.\n\nBut she added that \"resources are tight and we need to make difficult decisions\".\n\n\"That is where the issue and question of targeting comes in,\" Ms Robison said.\n\n\"With the resources to roll out free school meals in secondary schools, would it be better targeted to support, for example, breakfast clubs or pre-clubs to make sure that children who are from the poorest families are actually getting three meals a day instead of one at lunchtime.\"\n\nShona Robison has backed the first minister's review of future spending plans\n\nMs Robison said the government could not and would not ignore the fact that many families were struggling to feed their children.\n\n\"We need to make sure that, within the limited resources we have, that money is being spent in the most effective way and that is what we're doing,\" she said.\n\nUniversal free school lunches have been extended to children in P4 and P5 since the SNP retained power in the May 2021 election, saving families an average of \u00a3400 a year.\n\nBruce Adamson, the Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland, welcomed the deputy first minister's commitment to free meals for all primary pupils.\n\nBut he said the policy did not go far enough.\n\n\"When we are talking about something as basic as food, we know that a universal approach is effective,\" he said.\n\n\"We know that a targeted approach to free school meals means that some people miss out.\n\n\"Secondary pupils will be shocked that the Scottish government is reconsidering.\"\n\nScottish Labour MSP Paul O'Kane accused Humza Yousaf of \"jettisoning promises\" just weeks into his new job as first minister.\n\nHe said: \"There is hidden hunger in schools.\n\n\"The government have committed to free school meals from primary one to seven and haven't delivered it yet.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to

He added that it would be run jointly with Canadian, UK and French authorities.\n\nThe investigation is currently in its initial phase and efforts to recover the wreckage of the sub are ongoing. So far, five major pieces have been found 3,800m (12,467ft) below the surface in a large debris field near the bow of the Titanic.\n\nCpt Neubauer said investigators would be taking \"all precautions\" if they discover human remains.\n\nHe said the investigation could lead to tougher regulations and safety recommendations for submersibles, but could not confirm how long it would take to complete.\n\nOnce all evidence has been collected, Cpt Neubauer said investigators would likely hold a formal hearing to get witness testimony.\n\nHe added that interviews were already being conducted in the Canadian city of St John's, where the Titan's support vessel, the Polar Prince launched and towed the submersible into the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCanadian investigators boarded the support ship on Saturday as part of their own investigation into the disaster.\n\nUS Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger, who also spoke to reporters, was asked about the cost of the search and rescue operation but declined to answer.\n\nHe said it was not policy to charge for search and rescue and the service does not put a cost on human life or rescuing people in the \"dangerous environment\" of the ocean, adding \"we always answer the call\".\n\n\"We conduct disciplined operations with warranted risk to put our resources and lives at risk to save others. That's who we are.\"", "England is not ready for the unavoidable impacts of global warming, the government's advisers on climate change say in a new report.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said the government hasn't achieved any of its targets and needed a policy \"step change\" to avoid loss of life.\n\nThe CCC reviews the government's adaptation plans - preparations to cope with the effects of global warming.\n\nThe government said it would take the recommendations into account.\n\nThe committee, also known as the CCC, is an independent group of experts set up to provide the government with advice on the climate crisis.\n\nBaroness Brown, chairwoman of the CCC's sub-committee on adaptation, said that the government wasn't taking the issue seriously enough.\n\n\"The government's lack of urgency on climate resilience is in sharp contrast to the recent experience of this country,\" she said.\n\nOver the last couple of years, England has faced a series of extreme weather events, likely made worse by climate change.\n\nLast year was the warmest on record for the UK - temperatures broke 40C for the first time and more than 25,000 wildfires broke out.\n\nSheffield was hit by wildfires last year as summer temperatures breached 40C in parts of England\n\nAs well as extreme heat, rainfall has been consistently low for parts of south and southeast England, affecting crop yields.\n\nAndrew Blenkiron's 6,000-acre (24 sq km) farm in Thetford, Norfolk saw just 2.4mm of rain in February compared to the local average for that month of 43mm. He has now been forced to cut back on plans to plant potatoes, onions, parsnips and carrots by around a fifth.\n\nHe said: \"Farmers are at the very forefront of climate change on a day-to-day basis... we are used to working with these issues, but we are concerned with the extremes we are now facing.\"\n\nTo cope with the impacts of extreme heat Mr Blenkiron has enlarged reservoirs on his farm and shifted harvesting patterns to prevent wildfires.\n\nBut he said that farmers needed more money from government to implement their climate plans, especially if they involved new infrastructure projects like reservoirs.\n\nAndrew Blenkiron has adapted his farm to reduce emissions and lower the impact of climate change\n\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC: \"We have taken decisive action to improve the UK's climate change resilience - including investing a record \u00a35.2bn into flood defences.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the government would factor in the committee's recommendations to the new National Adaptation Plan, which is expected to be published this summer.\n\nThe committee said the government needed to consider the resilience of farming systems in other countries.\n\nNearly half of all the food the UK consumes is imported. The CCC said this makes all of the UK's food supply vulnerable to global weather patterns.\n\nAlready this year supermarkets have placed limits on fruit and vegetable sales after bad weather in North Africa affected supply.\n\nThe committee has recommended the government require all large food sector companies by law to assess the climate risks to their supply chains.\n\nClimate change could lead to more empty supermarket shelves\n\nThe committee reviewed the government's plans across 12 other areas - from buildings to transport to nature. They found that just five out of the 45 policy areas had fully credible climate change plans and none were making progress to improve climate resilience.\n\nThe committee commended the government for updating building regulations last year for new domestic properties - requiring developers to take account of overheating.\n\nBut they said this needed to be extended to cover all existing homes - as 80% of all homes that will be around in 2050 have already been built.\n\nAs many as 4.6 million homes overheat, according to a recent survey, putting those with existing health conditions like asthma at risk.\n\nThe report singled out England's internet networks as being woefully unprepared for climate change despite their crucial importance.\n\nEngland's internet networks - made up of hundreds of data centres, and extensive networks of cables and masts - underpin the UK's service-based economy.\n\nThis infrastructure is already at risk from extreme weather, including heat and strong winds during storms. In November 2021, Storm Arwen left one million British properties without power and internet supply.\n\nThe committee found \"there was no visible plan by the industry or government, to manage long-term risk\".\n\nThe UK's internet supply is at risk from extreme weather as shown during Storm Arwen\n\nMatt Evans, director of Markets at techUK, the UK's tech trade association, told the BBC the report showed there needed to be better collaboration across industry and government.\n\nBut he said it \"doesn't fully capture the resiliency strategies employed by high-tech industries\".\n\nThe committee did praise local governments for innovative climate change preparation, including the work of Kent County Council to help farmers switch their crops to those that will fare better in warmer weather.\n\nBut Baroness Brown said that central government needed to better support local adaptation plans by providing more funding and more region-specific information on future threats.", "Partygate investigator Sue Gray was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff in March this year\n\nFormer civil servant Sue Gray has chosen not to be interviewed as part of a Cabinet Office inquiry into talks with Labour about a senior party role, a minister has said.\n\nMs Gray quit the civil service after being offered a job as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff.\n\nA government appointments committee is investigating whether she breached civil service rules over the move.\n\nEarlier, Sir Keir said he was confident Ms Gray had not broken any rules.\n\nMs Gray has held some of the most senior roles in the civil service and is best known for leading an investigation into the Partygate scandal, which contributed to Boris Johnson's downfall as prime minister last year.\n\nShe ended her decades-long career with the civil service in March, as Labour announced the party had offered her one of its most senior jobs ahead of the next general election.\n\nThe Conservative government said the situation was \"unprecedented\" and ordered an internal investigation into the circumstances of her resignation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden issued a written statement to the House of Commons containing an update into the circumstances leading to Ms Gray's resignation.\n\nIn the statement, Mr Dowden said: \"Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations as part of this process but chose not to do so.\"\n\nMr Dowden added: \"I am unable at this stage to provide further information relating to the departure of Ms Gray whilst we consider next steps.\"\n\nThe internal investigation by the Cabinet Office is separate to an inquiry by the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which will provide the final judgement on Ms Gray's departure.\n\nAcoba is to recommend how long Ms Gray should wait before being allowed to take up the job with Labour.\n\nThe BBC has been told that Ms Gray's focus is on Acoba and she has \"fully cooperated\" with them and \"given them all the details requested\".\n\nDave Penman, leader of the FDA union, which represents civil servants, told Times Radio he understood why Ms Gray was prioritising Acoba rather than the Cabinet Office's internal investigation.\n\n\"Acoba is really the real deal when it comes to this and who's going to make a decision,\" Mr Penman said. \"And it really should be, because it isn't doing it for political ends.\"\n\nUnder the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.\n\nSenior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government.\n\nAcoba provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.\n\nHowever, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by its recommendations.\n\nA long delay could hamper attempts to have Ms Gray in place well before the next general election, which is widely expected next year, to help Labour prepare for government if it wins power.\n\nEarlier, Sir Keir accused the government of using the issue to try and deflect from the local election campaign, saying it should be focusing on the cost-of-living crisis instead.\n\n\"[The public are] not sitting at their breakfast talking about Sue Gray, they're talking about their bills,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMs Gray was thrust into the limelight after leading a government investigation into allegations of parties being held in Downing Street during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nShe has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team, since joining the civil service in the 1970s.\n\nMs Gray resigned from the post of second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in March, after it emerged she had been offered a job with Labour.\n\nLabour has insisted it did not approach Ms Gray until after her Partygate report was published.\n\nBut Mr Johnson and his allies have seized on Labour's job offer to claim Ms Gray's investigation when he was in power was an attempt to smear him.\n\nHer report was critical of the senior political and civil service leadership, saying they \"must bear responsibility\" for the culture at No 10 during Covid lockdowns.", "More than 175,000 patient appointments and procedures had to be cancelled in England when junior doctors went on strike this week, figures reveal.\n\nThat makes it the most disruptive NHS strike yet this winter.\n\nTens of thousands of medics took part in the 72-hour strike, with more senior hospital colleagues asked to cover.\n\nJunior doctors' representatives at the British Medical Association (BMA) have now accepted an offer to enter pay talks with the government.\n\nThe BMA said it would not announce new strike action while the negotiations were taking place.\n\nWhile emergency care was provided by consultants during the strike, many planned, non-urgent treatments were rescheduled.\n\nNHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis said: \"Despite the huge efforts that NHS staff made to keep patients safe and minimise disruption, this strike was on an unprecedented scale and had a greater impact than all the other industrial action we have seen so far this winter combined.\n\n\"Over 175,000 appointments and procedures were rescheduled to protect emergency, critical and urgent care for patients, which will inevitably impact on efforts to tackle the Covid backlog.\"\n\nSome of the delayed appointments and procedures will include hip and knee operations, as well routine checks for patients with conditions such as diabetes and even cancer.\n\nThe NHS has been trying to tackle a backlog made worse by Covid - there are still 7.2 million people on waiting lists for treatment in England.\n\nNurses, ambulance workers and physios have also staged strikes this winter, but have now paused action while they consider a pay offer from government.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it deeply regretted the cancellation of appointments but was \"pleased\" the BMA had agreed to enter talks, on the same terms as unions representing the other NHS workers.\n\nIt added the government was seeking a \"fair settlement which recognises the crucial role of junior doctors and the wider economic pressures facing the UK\".\n\nThe BMA said it sent a letter to Health Secretary Steve Barclay on Friday after the government's new pay offer to other NHS workers, proposing to meet next week.\n\nIn a Twitter post, the BMA said its aim was to achieve full pay restoration, adding it would enter the negotiations in \"good faith\".\n\nThe BMA is calling for a 35% pay rise for junior doctors, arguing this would reverse 15 years of cuts.\n\nJunior doctors represent nearly half of the medical workforce in England and include those who have just graduated from university, through to some with 10 years of experience.\n\nTwo-thirds of junior doctors are members of the BMA.\n\nThe latest figures suggest at least 86,000 were involved in the industrial action this week.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Rob Laurenson, the co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee, said: \"Every day junior doctors despair as they see operations cancelled and treatment postponed for the millions on the waiting lists because our health services are in crisis.\n\n\"But rescheduling appointments as a result of the strike action could have been avoided if the health secretary had come to the table and negotiated an agreed settlement with us before any strike action was taken.\n\n\"The NHS had more than two months' notice that we would strike for 72 hours if the ballot was successful; the government has been in no doubt about our campaign for full pay restoration for over six months and this has been borne out by the number of junior doctors in England who have taken part in the industrial action.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external

the searing heat of mid-summer, when many Spaniards are on holiday.\n\nPolling for Spain's 37 million voters will continue Sunday until 20:00 (18:00 GMT), although almost 2.5 million have already cast their ballots by post.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o, 61, caused controversy during the campaign by appearing to cast doubt on the management of postal votes.\n\nThe conservative leader wants to roll back many of the Socialist reforms. If he turns to the Vox party to form a majority in Spain's 350-seat parliament, it would mean the first far-right involvement in government since the Franco dictatorship ended in 1975.\n\nConservative leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o (R) is eyeing victory but he is unlikely to win a majority in parliament\n\nVox leader Santiago Abascal is a Spanish nationalist whose popularity has been driven as much by a fierce opposition to Catalan separatism and feminism as by anti-immigration policies.\n\n\"This will be a victory of progress over backwardness, the future over the past, truth over lies,\" Mr S\u00e1nchez has said. \"The right is focusing on telling lies, we are focusing on making a comeback.\"\n\nSince 2020, Mr S\u00e1nchez, 51, has led the first coalition government of Spain's modern era together with Unidas Podemos, to his left.\n\nHis administration has navigated the pandemic, a volcanic eruption on the Canary island of La Palma and the impact of the war in Ukraine, while overseeing a steady drop in the jobless rate and one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe.\n\nHowever, these issues have featured much less during the campaign than Mr S\u00e1nchez would have liked. Instead, he has faced fierce criticism of his government's reliance on the parliamentary support of Basque and Catalan separatists.\n\nThe right has cast Mr S\u00e1nchez as a cynical power-grabber, willing to engage with the enemies of Spain's constitutional democracy in order to remain in office.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o has said that if elected he plans to reverse a series of reforms introduced by the left-wing government, including laws tackling the legacy of the Franco nationalist dictatorship and making gender transition easier. He also wants to review new euthanasia and abortion legislation.\n\nHe has appealed to Spaniards to give him enough votes to \"end the impasses\" in the country's politics. \"A strong majority that doesn't need to rely on radicals is crucial in order for us to move forwards,\" he said.\n\nHe has come under pressure in the latter stages of the campaign over his friendship with a notorious Galician drug trafficker, Marcial Dorado, during the 1990s. Mr Feij\u00f3o has said he was unaware of Dorado's criminal activities at the time.\n\nIn regional and municipal elections in May, the PP gained ground as the Socialists and other parties on the left suffered losses.\n\nHowever, a new left-wing platform, Sumar, has been formed for the general election, gathering 15 parties under the same banner, including Unidas Podemos. Led by charismatic labour minister Yolanda D\u00edaz, Sumar is aiming to secure third place ahead of Vox, and thus give Mr S\u00e1nchez a chance of forming a new coalition government.\n\nThe PP and Vox have already formed dozens of coalitions and governing partnerships on a local level.\n\nThe parties on the left warn that victory on Sunday for Mr Feij\u00f3o would open the door to the far right entering the national government, bringing with it a rolling back of rights for immigrants, women and the LGBTQ+ community.", "Two poultry workers in England have tested positive for bird flu, although there are no signs of human-to-human transmission, the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.\n\nBoth people were known to have recently worked on an infected poultry farm and have since tested negative.\n\nNeither worker experienced symptoms of avian influenza, with both cases found during screening.\n\nThe risk to the general population remains very low, the UKHSA added.\n\nThe UKHSA is running a programme of testing workers who have come into contact with infected birds, but is also running asymptomatic testing.\n\nThe first person who tested positive is thought to have inhaled the virus.\n\nThe second person is thought to be a more complicated case and it is unclear whether they have suffered a genuine infection or whether they too inhaled the virus while at work.\n\nThe UKHSA says precautionary contact tracing has been undertaken for this second individual.\n\nChief Medical Advisor at the UKHSA Professor Susan Hopkins said that globally there is \"no evidence of spread of this strain from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population.\"\n\n\"It remains critical that people avoid touching sick or dead birds, and that they follow the DEFRA advice about reporting,\" she added.\n\nProfessor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the finding should lead to \"greater attention\" on asymptomatic infection and sampling.\n\nHe said it was important to sequence the virus in the two workers and infected birds in order to see if there were any mutations of concern, adding that resampling the workers could indicate whether they had developed an immune response.\n\nThere are various different types of avian flu that have circulated in the past - the latest one infecting birds is H5.\n\nAlthough none of these strains easily infect people, and they are not usually spread from person to person, small numbers of people have been infected around the world, leading to a small number of deaths.\n\nThere have been very few cases of bird flu transmission to people recorded in the UK. The virus is not that well suited to humans and does not spread as easily as it does between birds.\n\nIt usually requires very close contact with an infected bird, which is why experts say the risk to humans is currently considered very low.\n\nThese latest cases do not change that assessment. There is no suggestion that the virus has changed to become more infectious to us or spread from person to person.\n\nA \"mandatory housing order\" for England and Wales was lifted on 18 April, meaning poultry and captive birds could be kept outside again.\n\nThe measures were introduced during the world's biggest ever bird flu outbreak.\n\nGovernment guidance on the signs of bird flu and how to report it can be found here.", "The British have a love-hate relationship with the NHS.\n\nAccording to researchers at the King's Fund, the public gave the NHS its worst rating since records began 40 years ago. Just 29% said they were satisfied with the NHS in 2022.\n\nAnd yet we still love it. A whopping 90% of the public agrees the service should be free and available to everyone.\n\nBut with more than seven million people on waiting lists, almost everyone knows someone who isn't getting the care they need.\n\nAs the NHS approaches its 75th anniversary, politicians are falling over themselves to praise the service.\n\nBut when the cameras aren't rolling, the message you hear can be a very different one. Just like us, politicians have a love-hate relationship with the NHS.\n\n\"The whole system is paralysed and not improving - all the progress is going backwards.\" That's not the kind of thing you're likely to hear a minister say in public but it is the candid verdict of a former health minister talking privately.\n\nThey say the NHS chief executive has become the \"rationer-in-chief\" tasked with \"spreading the jam more and more thinly\" as the demand for care races ahead of what's available.\n\nAnother Conservative former minister tells me the \"National Health Service is an oxymoron\", a contradiction, because \"the leadership is incredibly patchy and outcomes are mixed\".\n\nFor Labour, a source says there is increasing \"anxiety and jeopardy\" about the future of the service and \"it really is a case of change or die\".\n\nYou'd be hard pressed to find a politician who would admit that services are being rationed but in off-the-record conversations that word comes up again and again.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Are you in a parallel universe on economy and NHS? - PM asked\n\nOne of the former ministers says \"people have to understand that there is rationing according to wait\" - saying that is the \"trade-off\" with the traditional model.\n\nA former government adviser says \"people know there is rationing - the service is pretty good when you get it - but you might not\".\n\nYou won't find health rationing on any political leaflet or Facebook ad.\n\nBut the public's attachment to the concept of the NHS remains extremely strong. Before and after the pandemic voters are in no mood for a discussion about changing its core principles - despite all the problems.\n\nThe former government health adviser tells me that any serious conversation about fundamental change is nigh on impossible.\n\n\"Any sophisticated Tory politician knows they'd sign their own death warrant\" if they raised the prospect of a wholesale change, they say.\n\nRemember Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's proposal to fine patients if they missed a GP appointment? It was ditched almost as soon as it was suggested.\n\nAnother former official describes the public's strong emotional connection to the idea of the institution itself, saying: \"It's like your family. I'll moan and moan and moan about it, but if someone else from outside has a go at them, I'll have them on toast. It's like criticising your football team - they can naff off!\"\n\nPlenty of politicians talk about reforms to the service - whether that is working with the private sector or this week's workforce plan. But whether it is required or not, it is almost unthinkable now that any mainstream politician would argue for a sweeping change to the whole system.\n\nOf course, that has an impact on what governments choose to do to try and improve the service, which might not be the most effective long-term focus.\n\nOne former official suggests: \"Politicians want solutions with easy metrics like cutting waiting lists.\n\n\"If you do cut them in the short term, that just means more operations, it doesn't address stopping people being ill in the first place.\"\n\nA former minister says rather than go for bold reforms after the pandemic \"we have gone straight back to the voodoo land of heroic pointless commitments that will never get met because as a country we are so ill\".\n\nAnother suggests ministers are actually scared of telling the public hard truths about increasing cost pressures in the health service. \"The public has unrealistic expectations of what we can deliver - the government is frightened of that,\" they say.\n\nAnd as we've talked about many times here and on the show, unless and until governments confront the aching gaps in care for the elderly and vulnerable, the rest of the health service has to absorb the costly consequences of social care system that to a large extent just doesn't work.\n\nOne of the former ministers I've spoken to is intensely frustrated that it is so hard to have a full conversation about the NHS, saying that \"it's a political problem, not a resources problem. Our politicians just aren't finding the space\" to talk about really bold changes.\n\nOne former adviser agrees, saying \"everyone of all stripes is scared to take it on\".\n\nYet the fact politicians find it almost impossible to talk about alternatives is also a tribute to the longevity of the NHS and the public's belief in it.\n\nThe former adviser suggests that while people have to wait and outcomes vary \"as a system it is extraordinarily fair and that has to be worth something\".\n\nLove it and hate it. It is most certainly here to stay.", "Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff was injured in December at Top Gear's test track in Surrey\n\nThe BBC says it has halted the latest series of Top Gear after presenter Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff was hurt in an accident while filming.\n\nThe presenter was injured in December at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\n\nThe BBC said: \"Under the circumstances, we feel it would be inappropriate to resume making series 34.\"\n\nThe broadcaster said a decision on how best to continue would be made later this year.\n\nFollowing the accident on 13 December, the former England cricketer received medical care at the scene before being taken to hospital for further treatment.\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said: \"We have sincerely apologised to Freddie and will continue to support him with his recovery.\n\n\"We understand this [halting the show] will be disappointing for fans, but it is the right thing to do, and we'll make a judgement about how best to continue later this year.\"\n\nThe decision has also impacted the production team, said the BBC, adding that there would be a health and safety review of the show, undertaken by an independent third party.\n\nBBC Studios, which produces the show, also conducted its own investigation of the accident.\n\nA spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) - the national regulator for workplace safety in England, Wales and Scotland - said: \"We've completed our enquires into this incident and will not be investigating further.\"\n\nIt is understood the circumstances of the incident did not meet the threshold for further investigation. The regulator can launch criminal prosecutions against employers where staff have suffered serious injury or died at work.\n\nPhilippa Childs, head of Bectu, the union for workers in the creative industries, told the BBC: \"Crew wellbeing on set is paramount, and it's critical productions have stringent policies and procedures in place to protect freelancers' physical and mental health.\n\n\"Productions must ensure they are meeting the highest safety standards and, where incidents occur, must ensure lessons are learnt and appropriate support is provided for the workforce.\"\n\nFormer presenter Matt LeBlanc drove past a bride and groom at St Paul's Cathedral in 2016\n\nTop Gear, one of the broadcaster's most successful and exported programmes, has had a series of different presenters since 2002.\n\nDecember's accident was not the first Flintoff has suffered since he first began presenting the show.\n\nThe father-of-four crashed into a market stall in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire in February 2019.\n\nIn September of the same year, he also crashed during a drag race while he was filming at Elvington Airfield in Yorkshire, but walked away unharmed.\n\nIn June 2022, Flintoff was racing in a bobsleigh at a course in Norway when it flipped over, but he again came out of the crash unscathed.\n\nPaddy McGuinness, Chris Harris and Freddie Flintoff were announced as Top Gear's latest hosts in 2018\n\nFlintoff's impact on Top Gear should not be underestimated - he played a key role in rescuing the show after the tricky era that followed the departure of Clarkson, Hammond and May.\n\nThe show faltered under Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, who took over presenting duties in 2016. They struggled to recapture the chemistry of the hugely popular previous hosts.\n\nBut when Flintoff, McGuinness and Harris took the reins, there was palpable relief among BBC bosses when it became clear the unlikely trio of a cricketer, car expert and comic and gameshow host had great on-screen chemistry.\n\nThat relationship between the lead presenters is crucial to the show's appeal. The slightly juvenile pranks and jokes are what elevates Top Gear from being a car review show for petrol-heads to a winning entertainment format which appeals to a mainstream audience.\n\nIts success over the years has made the programme a cash cow for the BBC. The corporation profits significantly from the series being sold to other countries. It is a strong brand, with its own magazine and merchandise.\n\nThe show's immediate future may be in doubt for now, but Flintoff's health and wellbeing must remain the top priority for the corporation. As a source close to Flintoff told the Times: \"Freddie has been seriously emotionally and physically affected by the crash.\"\n\nFlintoff retired from cricket in 2009 having played 79 Tests, 141 one-day internationals and seven T20s for England.\n\nHe played a key role in England's Ashes successes of 2005 and 2009.\n\nAfter retiring from cricket in 2010 - he had one professional bout as a boxer, won the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and also took to acting.\n\nHe joined Top Gear as a host in 2019 and has co-starred in the show with Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Their most recent series attracted an average consolidated audience of 4.5 million viewers.\n\nRacing driver Perry McCarthy, who previously portrayed the Stig on Top Gear, told The World At One on BBC Radio 4: \"One thing about life in a car, whether it be on the road or on a track, is that when something goes wrong, it goes wrong really quickly.\n\nHe added: \"You've got this enthusiasm from presenters which is wonderful, that's great, that's what the show's about. But you've got to be careful. So you need people around that show who really understand what can go wrong.\"\n\nRichard Hammond (left, with Jeremy Clarkson and James May) was injured in 2006\n\nOne of Top Gear's previous presenters, Richard Hammond, was also injured while filming for the series in 2006.\n\nHammond crashed a car while travelling at nearly 300mph at the former RAF Elvington airbase near York, leaving him in a coma with a frontal lobe brain injury.\n\nHe survived and ultimately returned to the series alongside fellow hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May.\n\nThe trio left Top Gear in 2015 after an altercation between Clarkson and a producer.\n\nLast month, Hammond said he worried the crash could be responsible for his worsening memory.\n\nThe BBC said Top Gear is:", "Israeli's defence minister has been sacked after he spoke out against controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Yoav Gallant to a meeting and told him he no longer had faith in him as defence minister.\n\nThe plan to limit the powers of the judiciary led to months of protests.\n\nTens of thousands of protestors returned to the streets on Sunday night following Mr Gallant's dismissal.\n\nIn Jerusalem, police and soldiers used water cannon against demonstrators near Mr Netanyahu's house.\n\nThe leaders of the protest accuse Mr Netanyahu of behaving like a dictator and destroying the security of Israel.\n\nThe new law makes it harder for courts to remove a leader deemed unfit for office, which has angered many who consider it in the interests of the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, described Mr Gallant's sacking as a new low for the government, while Mr Gallant himself has described the planned legislation as an \"immediate and tangible danger\" to state security.\n\nIn a brief televised statement on Saturday night, Mr Gallant said members of the Israeli Defence Forces were angry and disappointed, with an intensity he had never seen before.\n\nShortly after his dismissal a day later, Mr Gallant wrote on Twitter: \"The state of Israel's security has always been and will always be my life's mission.\"\n\nThe defence minister had won the backing of some fellow members of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, but others on the far right had called for him to go.\n\nThe law is part of the right-wing coalition government's contentious plan to limit the powers of the judiciary.\n\nThe reforms include plans that would give the government full control over the committee which appoints judges, which he has said will pass in the Knesset next week.\n\nFar-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir supported Mr Netanyahu's move, saying,\"The prime minister decided on the necessary step and I congratulate him for that.\"\n\nIt includes enabling parliament to overrule decisions made by the Supreme Court - a move that critics say will undermine the independence of the judiciary and could be used for political ends.\n\nBut Mr Netanyahu says the reforms are designed to stop the courts overreaching their powers and that they were voted for by the public at the last election.\n\nIsrael's opposition leader Yair Lapid described Mr Gallant's sacking as \"a new low\" for the government.\n\n\"Netanyahu can fire Gallant, but he can't fire reality or fire the people of Israel who are fronting up to resist the coalition's madness,\" Mr Lapid added.\n\nFormer defence minister Benny Gantz praised Mr Gallant, who he said had put the security of the country above all interests.", "Fatoumatta Hydara died two days after her daughters Naeemah Drammeh and Fatimah Drammeh\n\nA man who murdered a mother and her two daughters by setting fire to their flat has been jailed for life.\n\nFatoumatta Hydara, 28, died along with Fatimah and Naeemah Drammeh, aged three and one, after their home in Clifton, Nottingham, was set alight in November.\n\nTheir neighbour Jamie Barrow was convicted of three counts of murder for deliberately starting the fire.\n\nBarrow, 31, was ordered to serve a minimum jail term of 44 years at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday.\n\nThe court heard Barrow took fuel from his motorbike, poured it through the letterbox of the family's Fairisle Close flat and set it alight in the early hours of 20 November.\n\nHe had admitted the manslaughter of the mother and her children but denied murdering them claiming he thought the flat was empty when he started the fire.\n\nMrs Hydara and her children died from smoke inhalation.\n\nSentencing, Justice Amanda Tipples said Barrow started a fireball that would have filled the flat with thick, toxic smoke within moments.\n\nShe said she was sure Barrow knew the family were inside and had heard Mrs Hydara's screams but did nothing to help.\n\nThe judge said Barrow had watched the fire take hold for five minutes before leaving the area with his dog as other neighbours rushed to try to help.\n\nHe later returned and pretended to know nothing about the fire, only later admitting to police that he started it.\n\nMrs Justice Tipples said: \"It is only you who knows why you did this.

So they go 'Dad, don't read a story, do it from your head',\" he said.\n\n\"I recorded the stories because I kept forgetting what I did the night before because I was dreaming of gin and tonic,\" he joked.\n\nOliver said he has worked to make the book as accessible as possible, inspiring younger readers who may be put off reading because of their learning difficulties.\n\nThe book, published on Thursday, is printed in a dyslexia-friendly font, and will be released as an audiobook.\n\nAccording to the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), sans serif fonts such as Arial and Comic Sans can appear less crowded for those with dyslexia.\n\nOliver is one of over six million people in the UK who have dyslexia, with one in ten thought to have the condition. The BDA says many don't know they're living with it.\n\nDyslexia affects people in different ways, including someone's coordination, organisation and memory.\n\nOliver said he was one of \"many kids left by the wayside\" at school because of his neurodiversity.\n\nWhile he was not diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD at school, the chef was labelled as having special needs and was taught separately.\n\n\"I've always had a chip on my shoulder about it,\" he told the programme, emphasising why his latest book was so important to him: \"For me, this was finally brushing the last chips off my shoulder.\"\n\nThe Dyslexia Association provides a wide range of services to directly assist and improve the lives of dyslexics of all ages.

peace deal against a backdrop of all-too-frequent political instability in Belfast.\n\nHe said the return of the power-sharing devolved government at Stormont was \"critical\" for Northern Ireland.\n\nBut he followed that up by adding: \"That's a decision for you to make, not for me to make.\"\n\nThe remark was simultaneously challenging and sensitive.\n\nThe White House will have been aware that a tone which could have been interpreted as overbearing would have fuelled unionist hostility towards a president who they have often criticised in the past.\n\nBut Mr Biden's visit seems to have gone down reasonably well with the leader of unionism.\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson says the president made it clear that he had no come to Belfast to interfere\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the president had made clear he hadn't come to \"interfere\" and that Mr Biden had \"recognised the need to bring balance to what he had to say\".\n\nThe DUP is vetoing the formation of a governing coalition at Stormont - the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly - in protest against Brexit trade barriers with the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Biden speaks often of his Irish roots but in Belfast he talked about his English ancestry.\n\nHe also mentioned the contribution made to the founding of the US by immigrants from an Ulster Scots background - the community which is associated with modern-day unionism.\n\nThat was surely an attempt to appeal to those in Northern Ireland who have been suspicious that US involvement in the peace process has been tinged with an Irish nationalist agenda.\n\nActor James Martin got the biggest round of applause during Biden's speech\n\nThe president's overriding message was that the US remained committed to Northern Ireland and was ready to invest.\n\nMr Biden even suggested Northern Ireland's economic output could triple \"if things continue to move in the right direction\".\n\nThe incentive was obvious - more stability would bring in more dollars.\n\nThe industries he mentioned are already bright spots in the Northern Ireland economy - cybersecurity, life sciences, green energy.\n\nAnd the biggest round of applause during the speech came when the president pointed out Northern Ireland actor James Martin, who was recently on stage at the Academy Awards when the short film he starred in won an Oscar.\n\nIt was a way of highlighting Northern Ireland's global reputation as a hub for TV and film production.\n\nThe projects which have been based here have included Game of Thrones - one of the biggest TV series of recent years.\n\nMr Biden seemed to suggest that the creative industries could be substantially expanded - he described Northern Ireland as a \"churn of creativity\".\n\nWhile the president has now moved across the Irish border, his economic envoy Joe Kennedy is staying on in Northern Ireland for a few days.\n\nHe will lead a trade delegation from the US later this year.\n\nNo-one can be sure if the devolved government will be in place when the corporate executives make their transatlantic journey.\n\nThe DUP has said it won't be swayed by any particular US input in deciding whether and when to allow power-sharing at Stormont to return.\n\nThe party is continuing to examine the new deal between the EU and the UK - the Windsor Framework - to assess whether it removes unionist concerns about Brexit trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThere was no expectation that President Biden's arrival would herald a sudden breakthrough.\n\nMichelle O'Neill says Joe Biden's message was one of \"hope and opportunity\"\n\nThe most fulsome praise for him came from non-unionist parties.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill, who is in line to be first minister if the devolved government is restored, said Mr Biden's visit was a \"special moment\".\n\nIt is likely that the president's schedule in Northern Ireland would have been more extensive if the political circumstances had been more favourable.\n\nFor example he did not accept an invitation to address the Stormont assembly, which was established by the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nHowever the prevailing view among those who witnessed his speech is that Mr Biden handled the sensitivities with skill and gave Northern Ireland a worthwhile moment in the worldwide spotlight.", "Ms Frendo said Saul \"always had the biggest infectious smile and was full of love\"\n\nA teenager who died when his e-bike collided with an ambulance after he was followed by police was \"the most sweetest, kindest boy ever\", his mother has said.\n\nSaul Cookson, 15, was being followed by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) traffic officers in Salford on Thursday until bollards blocked their vehicle's path.\n\nHis e-bike then collided with the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) vehicle.\n\nEmma Frendo said her son had been \"loved by all that met him\".\n\n\"He was the sweetest, most kindest boy ever, and always had the biggest infectious smile and was full of love,\" she said.\n\n\"Saul was a much-loved son, brother, grandson, and nephew, loved by all that met him.\"\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct has begun an investigation into Thursday's collision\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said an investigation into the collision.\n\nIt said Saul had been riding a black off-road Sur-Ron e-bike and was followed by officers along Fitzwarren Street and on to Lower Seedley Road at about 14:00 BST before the crash on Langworthy Road.\n\nWhile not on an active call at the time of the crash, NWAS said its vehicle was being driven back to a nearby ambulance station.\n\nIts crew were immediately able to treat the boy before taking him to hospital, where he later died.\n\nPolice and independent investigators have been examining the scene of the crash\n\nWriting on Facebook, Taylor-Jade Cookson paid tribute to her brother and said \"words cannot describe my feelings at the moment\".\n\n\"Rest in peace Saul I love you,\" she added.\n\nDozens of people have been leaving flowers and cards at the scene.\n\nTwo sapphire blue, heart-shaped balloons have been tied at the foot of a lamppost, along with flowers, candles, cards and a large white banner full of handwritten messages.\n\nAnother, circled with red hearts, simply reads \"Gone but not forgotten\".\n\nOne of Saul's relatives who attended the scene to lay flowers said the family was \"a mess\" following their loss.\n\nSaul's friend, 21-year-old Mitchell Murden, said he had been due to meet him on the day he died.\n\nHe described Saul as \"a good lad\" who \"kept himself to himself\".\n\nFamily friend Jacob Bailey said \"no-one had a bad word to say\" about Saul\n\nFamily friend Jacob Bailey, 19, told BBC Newsbeat he came to lay some flowers and pay his respects as he had \"known Saul since I was about five\".\n\n\"He was just one of those proper nice kids,\" he said.\n\n\"He never ever caused anyone any harm.\n\n\"No-one had a bad word to say about Saul.\"\n\nNeighbour Karen Cosgrove said she had passed the scene at about 14:30 BST on Thursday and saw Saul lying on the ground.\n\n\"I walked away, I could barely look at it,\" she said.\n\n\"His mum was there, she was screaming.\n\nHeartfelt messages have been left at the crash scene\n\nSome concerns have been expressed by local people about the availability and use of high-powered e-bikes.\n\nMr Murden said \"the majority\" of young people in the area had them.\n\nMike McCusker, lead member for transport at Salford City Council, said there was \"growing concern\" in the community about e-bikes, particularly \"very young men riding round without helmets on\".\n\n\"The ones we have on our loan schemes are limited to about 15mph, but there are unregulated ones that can go up to speeds of 60mph.\n\n\"We don't think regulation is keeping track with the technological advancements around e-bikes.\"\n\nFlowers and candles have also been left at the scene\n\nIn a statement, GMP said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy who tragically died.\"\n\nThe IOPC said it had begun gathering evidence, including dashcam footage from the police vehicle, and had taken initial statements from two police officers, who were being treated as witnesses.\n\nA representative said there was \"no indication at this early time... of direct physical contact between the police vehicle and the e-bike\", but examinations of both were \"continuing\".\n\nIOPC regional director Catherine Bates said it was \"important we understand the events leading up to this incident and will be looking at the actions and decision-making of police prior to the collision, including the reason for the decision to follow the bike\".\n\nShe asked anyone who witnessed or had dashcam footage of the collision or \"events leading up to it\" to get in

She also topped the UK singles charts for the first time in almost 14 years.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has said the album came from an experience where she \"did not feel welcome\", which motivated her to dig deeper into the history of country music.\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Tanner Adell, who appears on the album, describes Cowboy Carter's release as a \"very special moment\" for black country artists like her.\n\n\"I'm not the only one,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"There's lots of us in country music.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is music that my ancestors played and instruments that my ancestors created.\"", "Parachute Regiment flags were sold at a stall on the route of the Apprentice Boys parade last year\n\nThe sale of Parachute Regiment flags at next month's Apprentice Boys' parade in Londonderry has been banned.\n\nIt comes after a row erupted at the same event last year, when it emerged that the flags were being sold at a stall on the route of the parade.\n\nA report before Derry and Strabane District Council on Wednesday noted \"sensitivities\" surrounding the flags.\n\nSoldiers from the regiment shot dead 13 people in Derry on Bloody Sunday on 30 January 1972.\n\nThe motion before a council committee last week discussed new criteria for granting temporary licences for the Relief of Londonderry event.\n\nIt stated stallholders would not be granted a licence unless they agreed not to sell flags or emblems of the regiment.\n\nIt also said council officers would not grant a licence to anyone who intends to sell or display flags in support of paramilitary organisations.\n\nIt is illegal to sell flags in support of paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.\n\nLast year, at least one stallholder sold flags in support of the Ulster Volunteer Force.\n\nA number of flags were also seized by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in the Waterside area of the city.\n\nThe annual Apprentice Boys' parade is due to take place on 12 August.", "A firefighter operates during a wildfire at Aghios Charalambos area in Loutraki\n\nLarge swathes of southern Europe continue to swelter in record heat as wildfires rage across the continent.\n\nTemperatures hit a high of 46.3C in Sicily on Tuesday, and crews battled fires in Greece and the Swiss Alps.\n\nMost of Italy's major cities are on red alert, meaning the extreme heat carries a health risk to everybody not just vulnerable groups.\n\nScientists say climate change is making heatwaves longer, more intense and more frequent.\n\nAcross the world, millions of people are being impacted by extreme weather; from soaring temperatures in the US and China, to heavy rainfall in East Asia.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says heatwaves will become more severe in the years ahead, and that extreme weather patterns highlight the need for more climate action.\n\n\"These events will continue to grow in intensity and the world needs to prepare for more intense heatwaves,\" said John Nairn, senior extreme heat advisor at the UN agency.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But the best friends never shared with each other that that their coach Paul North had sexually abused them over many years.\n\nIn 2002, North was jailed for 10 years after Katie and another victim reported him to police. Then aged 18, she had found the strength to give evidence against him in court.\n\nBut once North was convicted, Katie's mother Sue said her daughter was abandoned by a criminal justice system that seemed more interested in the offender than the victim.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this story you can contact the BBC Action Line.\n\n\"In a way, she was sacrificed,\" she told the BBC. \"She got let down by the police, by the running club, and she got left hung out to dry.\"\n\nKatie was offered very little therapeutic support during the court process and nothing over the next 20 years.\n\n\"I can't see how she could have been expected to have got over that and just got on with life,\" Sue added.\n\nWhile North served just half of his sentence, his victims were left to deal with their ongoing trauma.

It claims to have worked with more than 16,000 people including the son of a former Mexican president and Hollywood actresses such as Mack.\n\nProsecutors say Mack helped recruit and groom women as sexual partners for the group's leader, Keith Raniere. Though Raniere, 62, was at the top of this structure and the only man, Mack served as one of his top female deputies.\n\nFemale recruits were allegedly branded with his initials and expected to have sex with him in exchange for becoming a part of the group, which was based in Albany, New York.\n\nThe news of Mack's release was initially reported by the New York newspaper Albany Times Union.\n\nMack, who was arrested in 2018, was facing as much as 17 years in prison but saw her sentence reduced after providing evidence to help prosecutors pursue their case against Raniere.\n\nIn 2020, he was sentenced to 120 years in prison for multiple crimes, including forcing women to be his sexual \"slaves\".\n\nBefore her sentencing, Mack apologised to those she said had been harmed by her actions, calling her involvement with the group \"the biggest mistake and regret of my life\".\n\n\"I am sorry to those of you that I brought into Nxivm,\" she said. \"I am sorry I ever exposed you to the nefarious and emotionally abusive schemes of a twisted man.\"", "The technology behind the world's most talked about artificial intelligence (AI) system, ChatGPT, is being added to its most ubiquitous work software, Microsoft 365.\n\nMicrosoft is calling the system Copilot and says it will be embedded into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\n\nMicrosoft boss Satya Nadella said it would \"fundamentally change the way we work.\"\n\nHowever, the firm admitted Copilot would sometimes make mistakes.\n\nChat GPT has captured the world's attention with its ability to quickly provide human-like responses to questions, even very complicated or abstract ones.\n\nHowever, those replies are sometimes inaccurate or provide completely invented information.\n\nWhile the tech being deployed by Microsoft in Office365 is not simply ChatGPT itself, it is based on the same language-learning model.\n\nThe firm acknowledged that Copilot may also sometimes be \"usefully wrong\".\n\n\"We all want to focus on the 20% of our work that really matters, but 80% of our time is consumed with busy work that bogs us down.

Motivation is obviously a big thing.\n\n\"Continuing having early losses in tournaments like this doesn't necessarily help with that.\"\n\nMurray cut a forlorn figure as he spoke to journalists, looking incredibly downbeat as he dissected his five-set defeat by 24-year-old Tsitsipas.\n\nThe scene was nothing new. Revealing raw emotion after difficult defeats at the place where he puts the greatest emphasis on winning has been common in the past few years.\n\nIn 2021, Murray said he needed to weigh up \"if all the hard work is worth it\" after an encouraging run was ended by Canada's Denis Shapovalov in the third round.\n\nIn 2022, an equally-despondent Murray also questioned his future after suffering his earliest exit at Wimbledon at the hands of American John Isner in the second round.\n\nThis year, for all the bullish talk in the build-up, the tournament ended with the same result.\n\n\"Losing in the second round, I don't find that motivating. It's not why I put all of the work in,\" said Murray, who has not reached the fourth round of a major since Wimbledon in 2017.\n\n\"It's similar to last year, I guess. I had a long think about things, spoke to my family, and decided to keep on going.\n\n\"I'm unbelievably disappointed and upset now. Maybe I will feel different in a few days but right now it doesn't feel good.\"\n\nThis summer, Murray has channelled all his efforts into a deep run at the place where he has won two of his three major titles.\n\nThat is what makes the disappointment even harder to take.\n\nMurray decided to skip the clay-court French Open, preferring instead to start his preparations on the British grass on which he thrives.\n\nDropping down to the ATP Challenger Tour - the level below the main tour - led to title wins in Surbiton and Nottingham.\n\nMurray suffered a chastening defeat against Alex de Minaur when he made the step up in class at Queen's. Nothing to panic about, he insisted.\n\nBut, crucially, it meant he missed out on a seeding and left him open to the prospect of facing one of the highest-ranked players in the first two rounds.\n\nThe draw threw up a potential second-round match against Tsitsipas - a two-time major finalist tipped to win one of the sport's biggest prizes sooner rather than later.\n\nWhen that highly anticipated meeting panned out, Murray stepped up to the occasion - as he regularly does on the big stage - and showed glimpses of his best.\n\nIt was testament to his performance that Tsitsipas had to produce his best display on grass in a long time to pull through.\n\nNot even that could soften the blow for Murray, who knows he can still mix it with the world's best.\n\n\"I certainly can. It's clear based on how the match went. There was only a few points in it,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's not just about winning the odd match against them really. To have a run at these tournaments, you need multiple, multiple wins in a row. I've not done that.\"\n\nMurray is not the type of player to rush into any major decisions and his love for the game is evident by the depths from which he has recovered to continue playing.\n\nLast weekend, Murray said he had an \"idea in my head\" about when he wanted to retire. That decision does not look imminent but the scars of this latest Wimbledon loss may lead to reassessment.\n\nTim Henman, Murray's former Davis Cup team-mate and long-time friend, believes the Scot will reflect more positively when \"the dust is settled\".\n\n\"Andy has got a wise head on slightly older shoulders now and he is absolutely right not to commit to anything,\" he said.\n\n\"He will reflect on how much effort he has put in this year. He dropped down levels to play in Challenger events and to win two on grass. That emphasises the hunger and desire.\n\n\"That desire still burns bright and I really hope there is more to come for Andy.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\u2022 None Is hydrogen the solution to our energy needs?

In some cases officers had sexual relationships while undercover and used dead children's names to create their false identities.\n\nHe says, had the use of these means been known publicly at the time, the SDS would have been brought to a rapid end.\n\nAnd he believes the tactic of taking dead children's identities should have been referred to senior Met officers and Home Office officials.\n\nOfficers were deployed into groups for years and some took on positions of responsibility. They reported extensive details on individuals, including their relationships and family lives.\n\nWhile the inquiry is covering more than 50 years of undercover policing, this first report focuses on the period 1968 to 1982. The inquiry has heard evidence from those spied on during these years. Witnesses included political activists, among them Peter Hain, now Lord Hain, who was involved in the anti-apartheid movement and went on to be a Labour cabinet minister as well as trade unionists and women deceived into relationships.\n\nSir John says the tactics used by the SDS should have been addressed at the highest level within the Metropolitan Police and the Home Office, which annually authorised and funded the unit. He outlines how both viewed the SDS as a potential source of embarrassment. And he says a report by senior police officers in 1976 did not address SDS tactics.\n\nIntelligence gathered by its officers was passed to bosses at Scotland Yard and MI5.\n\nThe stated aim of the SDS was to help police control public order in London but the groups targeted were not involved in terrorism or other serious crime, says the report.\n\nSir John concludes that the fact that the SDS did not infiltrate right-wing groups was not because of political bias. He says those running the unit decided these groups were already covered and they were concerned about the risk of violence.\n\nLord Hain was monitored in his youth - and when he became an MP\n\nLord Hain said the report revealed \"clear political responsibility for illegitimate undercover police operations, targeting anti-apartheid and anti-racist groups, going right up to prime ministers of the day\".\n\nHowever he said Sir John's statement that the decision not to infiltrate right-wing groups did not stem from political bias was \"an astounding endorsement of the very political bias the police and security services displayed at that time\".\n\nBaroness Doreen Lawrence, whose campaign for justice for her murdered son Stephen was spied upon, said: \"I now want to know who ordered the spying on me and my family.\n\n\"Who thought it necessary to intrude on a law-abiding family fighting for justice for their son?

He did not say which measures had been adapted, but the King is not expected to travel by tram in Bordeaux as originally planned.\n\n\"The final decision is not up to the mayor of Bordeaux and I imagine we'll be in touch with the British authorities and the prefecture on the subject of the visit,\" Mr Hurmic said.\n\nThe ninth day of protests on Thursday attracted more than a million people, according to the French interior ministry, although the unions put the number at 3.5 million.\n\nSome 300 marches went ahead peacefully, but some protests were marred by some of the worst scenes of violence since demonstrations began in January.\n\nMr Darmanin said 457 arrests were made across France and 441 members of the security forces were injured. There were also dozens of injuries among protesters hit by stun grenades fired by riot police in several cities. In Rouen, a woman was hit in the hand and lost her thumb.\n\nMuch of the violence took place on the sidelines of some of the marches, in Paris and other cities including Bordeaux, and the interior minister said 903 fires were lit on the streets of the capital alone.\n\nOne police officer who lost consciousness had to be dragged to safety after appearing to be struck on the head.\n\nIt was not clear who set the historic 18th-Century door of Bordeaux town hall on fire, although it was put out by firefighters after several minutes.\n\n\"I'm extremely saddened, shocked and angry that anyone could attack the town hall, the home of all of Bordeaux,\" said the mayor, who had left the building only minutes earlier. He vowed public services would resume there on Friday morning as normal.\n\nIn Paris, generally peaceful demonstrations were disrupted by occasional clashes between police and masked rioters who smashed shop windows, attacked a McDonald's restaurant and set a kiosk alight.\n\nPrime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne tweeted: \"Demonstrating and voicing disagreements is a right.

Mr Macron said the reforms were an economic necessity, and he was prepared to accept the resulting unpopularity.\n\n\"I listened to Macron yesterday and it was as if someone was spitting in our face,\" said Ad\u00e8le, a 19-year-old law student in Nanterre. \"For this pension reform, there is another way and if he doesn't do that, it's because he's not listening to the people.

Blockades of oil refineries and depots have begun to affect fuel supplies, and Le Figaro website said that by Thursday almost 15% of petrol stations had run out of either petrol or diesel.\n\nUnions and the political left believe the latest day of strikes was a success, but where the situation goes from here is an open question.\n\nPresident Macron was in Brussels for an EU summit as the protests unfolded. The government is hoping they will lose momentum, and that Thursday's violence will put people off.\n\nBut the opposition says the protests will not dwindle, and Parisian refuse collectors, who started their strike against the pension reform on 6 March, have renewed it until next Monday.\n\nFor more than two weeks bins have been left overflowing in many districts in Paris, and the capital does not look its best ahead of King Charles' trip.\n\nLeft-wing politicians have objected to the timing of the state visit, with Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon assessing it is \"not the right moment\".\n\nGreen MP Sandrine Rousseau called for it to be cancelled, questioning the location of the royal banquet. \"Is it really the priority to receive Charles III at Versailles?

When they arrived I noticed one of them was carrying a Sainsbury's carrier bag,\" Ms Reid said.\n\nInside the carrier bag was a six-inch box containing samples taken from Gary which had been used in tests without her permission.\n\n\"It knocked me for six and was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life,\" Ms Reid said.\n\n\"I was so shocked and said 'How dare you. That is the only parts of my son I have and you want to hand them to me in a carrier bag?'\n\n\"I was absolutely horrified. When I told my son, Steven, he was dumbfounded.\"\n\nThe officials then took the remains back and they were sent to the undertaker.\n\nThe exhumed coffin in 2017, which was not prepared by NHS Lothian, contained items including a shroud and a cross\n\nAn NHS Lothian spokeswoman denied Ms Reid's claim that she was asked to look inside the box by the officials.\n\nTracey Gillies, medical director for NHS Lothian said: \"I would like to repeat publicly the apology we made to Ms Reid in person for the upset and distress this has caused.\n\n\"The samples that formed part of the investigation were placed in a dignity wooden casket to be returned to Ms Reid while she was in hospital.\n\n\"This was then placed within a plastic bag to avoid drawing attention as they walked through the hospital.\n\n\"We are sincerely sorry for the additional distress this caused.

Pieces would be shaved off for microscope tests, without Ms Reid's permission, and the rest were stored in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.\n\nMs Reid said she still does not know what happened to the rest of Gary's body.\n\nProf Sue Black said she had never seen anything like it\n\nIn September 2017, a court order was granted which allowed an exhumation to be carried out at Saughton Cemetery in Edinburgh.\n\nForensic anthropologist Prof Dame Sue Black concluded the coffin had been buried without containing any human remains.\n\nA shawl, a hat, a cross and a name tag were found in the burial plot, as well as the disintegrated coffin - but no skeletal remains and no sign of decomposition.\n\nProf Black told BBC Scotland at the time: \"Ultimately there is only one possible logical explanation - and that is that the body was not put in that coffin.\"\n\nHowever, the Crown Office said a new investigation by independent experts had concluded Gary had been buried at the time of his death.\n\nIt also found no evidence of criminality or unlawful organ retention.\n\nMs Reid has campaigned for years to find out what happened to her son, and camped outside the Crown Office in Edinburgh while on hunger strike in 2022.\n\nShe said finally she had her son's remains returned when Labour MSP Foysol Choudhury and his assistant, Liz Catterall, intervened.\n\nMr Choudhury said: \"When I asked NHS staff to meet Lydia to help her fill out the necessary forms, so that Gary's remains could be transferred back into her care, we did not expect Gary's remains to be brought to this meeting.\n\n\"Not only was this surprise action inappropriate and unsettling, but Gary's remains were shockingly brought to that meeting in a plastic supermarket carrier bag.\n\n\"Lydia has been fighting for justice for Gary for 48 years and then she found out that her baby son's remains were carried around in a plastic bag. This is absolutely shocking and was incredibly disrespectful.\n\n\"NHS Lothian have offered unreserved apologies but these events show that more training is needed to ensure sensitive and appropriate behaviour in the delivery of NHS services.\"", "Rapper ArrDee appeared tasting rum and drinking with friends in a nightclub\n\nTwo adverts for alcohol brand Litty Liquor have been banned for encouraging excessive and irresponsible drinking.\n\nInstagram posts from the Litty Liquor account in December featured photos of the rapper ArrDee tasting rum and drinking with friends in a nightclub.\n\nThe regulator said the adverts were \"likely to encourage excessive consumption of alcohol\".\n\nThe rapper is under 25 which is also in breach of advertising rules.

It happens every three to seven years, and in the warming phase, warmer waters come to the surface of the tropical Pacific and push heat into the atmosphere.\n\n\"Climate scientists aren't surprised about the global daily temperature record being broken, but we are very concerned,\" Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said.\n\nIt \"should be a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the world needs more oil and gas,\" she added.\n\nBefore this week, the last time the record was broken was in August 2016.\n\nExperts warn that many societies have not yet adapted to more extreme heat and the impacts it has on people and the environment.\n\nThe temperature readings come from a tool called Climate Reanalyzer. Scientists at the University of Maine use a combination of readings from surface, air balloon and satellite observations as well as computer modelling to assess average global temperatures.\n\nThe readings are not an official government record, but they are closely watched as an indicator of how temperatures are fluctuating.\n\nOn Thursday the US weather service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it could not confirm records that come partly from computer simulations, according to Associated Press.\n\n\"But we recognize that we are in a warm period due to climate change,\" NOAA said.\n\nScientists warn that it is uncommonly hot and it is likely the records will continue to be broken this summer.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o hasn't peaked yet and summer is still in full swing in the Northern Hemisphere, so it wouldn't be surprising if the daily temperature record is broken again and again in 2023,\" Dr Paulo Ceppi, lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said.\n\nHigher global temperatures are likely to make heatwaves even hotter and wildfires more severe, he added.\n\nLast month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate monitoring service Copernicus said on Thursday.\n\nIn the UK, record-high June temperatures saw \"unprecedented\" fish deaths and threatened the survival of insects as plants they feed from wilted, warned environment groups.\n\nA study by the UK Met Office concluded that climate change made the June heat more than twice as likely.\n\nScorching heat is continuing to hit parts of the world, with North Africa seeing temperatures of near 50C and parts of China suffering under 40C.\n\nSouthern Europe could see more than 60 days this summer when conditions are dangerous for humans, the European Environment Agency warned in June.\n\nHigher-than-average heat also affects crops and raises the risk of wildfires.\n\nHeat increases in seas have also been detected in recent weeks, including a marine heatwave in the UK and Ireland.\n\nAnd Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for June - 17% below average - since satellite observations began.\n\nGovernments globally are committed to reducing their carbon emissions to reach net zero - the point when humans will stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\n\nGlobal temperatures will only start to approximately stabilise once the world reaches net zero, Dr Ceppi explains.", "Rishi Sunak and Mark Drakeford with harbour master John Goddard at Holyhead, where they announced the freeports\n\nTwo Welsh freeports are to be created which aim to bring 20,000 jobs and investment worth \u00a35bn.\n\nBids from Celtic Freeport, at Milford Haven and Port Talbot, and Anglesey Freeport have been given the green light by the UK and Welsh governments.\n\nFreeports are zones where companies benefit from tax and duty relief and simplified customs processes.\n\nEach was chosen to exploit renewable energy opportunities and are expected to contribute to UK net-zero ambitions.\n\nThe BBC has been told Celtic Freeport's bid scored highest during the competition run by the UK and Welsh governments.\n\nIt was based around maximising local benefits of a separate plan for a floating off-shore wind project in the Celtic Sea.\n\nAccording to official figures, Wales had an export trade worth \u00a3115bn between 2016 and December 2022.\n\nA third bid, based around Newport and Cardiff Airport, failed.\n\nCeltic Freeport will be based around Port Talbot and Milford Haven ports, in the counties of Neath Port Talbot and Pembrokeshire respectively.\n\n\"I think it's a really big opportunity for our local area,\" said Andrew Scott, 16, who is studying his A-levels at Pembrokeshire College.\n\nA-Levels pupil Andrew Scott says the Celtic freeport will encourage young people to stay in Pembrokeshire\n\nHe said he was interested in engineering and the renewables sector since plans to build wind farms off the Pembrokeshire coast were announced.\n\n\"It's giving young people like myself the opportunity to stay local,\" he explained.\n\n\"I plan to do a degree, and I hope to come back to Pembrokeshire and to work in this sector once I've achieved that higher education\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAnglesey Freeport will be based around Holyhead, Rhosgoch, Anglesey prosperity zone, and science park M-Sparc.\n\nCeltic Freeport Consortium chairman Roger Maggs said there was now potential to access \u00a35.5bn of private and public investment.\n\n\"The future is exciting,\" he said.\n\nTata Steel, which has a site in Port Talbot, said it was delighted the Celtic Freeport bid was successful.\n\nNeath Port Talbot council leader Steve Hunt said it was \"an absolute game changer\" for his county and Wales.\n\nAnglesey council leader Llinos Medi said freeport status would be an important to securing a brighter future for Ynys M\u00f4n and north Wales.\n\n\"Too many of our young people have had to leave their communities to find decent jobs and a secure future.

They would only have to pay them if the product left the freeport and entered the UK.\n\nIn England, businesses in freeports also have cheaper business rates, but in Wales that would be up to the Welsh government.\n\nThey also pay a lower rate of national insurance for new staff.\n\nThe argument in favour of freeports is that they create new jobs and attract investment.\n\nBut critics argue they do not create new jobs but simply encourage businesses to move from one location to another.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Ros Atkins on... the Russian social media videos appearing to show Kremlin drone attack\n\nExplosions have been heard in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, a day after Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a drone attack on the Kremlin.\n\nAttacks were also reported in Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south.\n\nThe air strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to speak at The Hague as part of an unexpected visit to the Netherlands.\n\nHe will also visit the International Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has accused Ukraine of attempting to assassinate President Vladimir Putin, but Mr Zelensky denied that his country carried out the attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said: \"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities.\"\n\nMr Zelensky was speaking in Finland, where he made a surprise visit and met his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto and the leaders of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.\n\nDuring his visit to the Netherlands, Mr Zelensky is expected to meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Dutch media said that the two were likely to discuss Mr Zelensky's demands for more military support - namely long-range weapons and fighter jets.\n\nLast January, Mr Rutte said that supplying fighter jets was not taboo, although such a move would be \"a really big next step\".\n\nFollowing the alleged drone attacks, Russia threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Officials said that the victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs.\n\nAnd in the early hours of Thursday morning, air raid sirens rang out across many Ukrainian regions. Loud blasts were reported in Kyiv and Odesa.\n\nAt the same time, a drone hit an oil refinery in southern Russia, setting part of it on fire - the latest in a series of explosions, fires and drone attacks that have occurred in Russia in recent weeks.\n\nSome commentators have argued that the alleged drone strike on the Kremlin was internally conducted and purposefully staged by Russia.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said it is \"extremely unlikely that two drones could have penetrated multiple layers of air defence and detonated or been shot down just over the heart of the Kremlin in a way that provided spectacular imagery caught nicely on camera\".\n\nIt said that \"Russia likely staged this attack in an attempt to bring the war home to a Russian domestic audience and set conditions for a wider societal mobilisation\".\n\nYurii Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said he thought Russia had staged the attack on the Kremlin to try to \"show some kind of escalation on the part of Ukraine\".\n\nBut other commentators disagreed, saying that Russia would have little interest in making itself look \"weak\" by staging an attack that makes the Kremlin look vulnerable.\n\nIt would also lead to questions about how well-protected Mr Putin is - and about the effectiveness of Russian air defences.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAt least 15 people have died after a bus carrying elderly people to a casino crashed into a truck in the Canadian province of Manitoba.\n\nPolice said the collision happened on the Trans-Canada Highway near Carberry, two hours west of Winnipeg.\n\nAt least 10 people, including the two drivers, have been taken to hospital.\n\nWitness John Proven said he saw a burning vehicle in a ditch just after noon local time on Thursday. \"I have never seen an accident that big.\"\n\nMr Proven said he also saw a semi-trailer lorry nearby with a burned front end.\n\nIn several tweets, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Manitoba said it was responding to a serious \"mass casualty\" collision and that all of its resources, including its major crime unit, had been deployed to the scene.\n\nEmergency vehicles, including an air ambulance and 12 ambulances, were dispatched to the scene at 11:43 local time on Thursday (17:35 BST), the RCMP said at a press conference.\n\nMost of the elderly people aboard were from Dauphin, Manitoba, and the surrounding areas. They were traveling to the Sand Hills Casino in the town of Carberry, which confirmed that the bus had been expected to arrive later in the day.\n\nThose in hospital have \"significant\" injuries due to the force of the crash, officials said.\n\nWilliam Doherty, the CEO of Day & Ross trucking company - which was involved in the crash - told CTV News that \"the thoughts of the entire Day & Ross team are with those who have lost loved ones in this terrible incident\".\n\n\"We are holding out hope that those injured will recover,\" Mr Doherty added. \"We will fully cooperate with the investigation and offer any assistance and support that we can.\"\n\nAmong those who have so far offered their condolences is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\"I'm keeping the injured in my thoughts,\" he said in a statement on Twitter. \"I cannot imagine the pain those affected are feeling - but Canadians are here for you.\"\n\nA spokesperson with the local air ambulance service told CBC News that the agency had deployed one of its largest responses ever to the crash.\n\n\"This is sort of in line with the similar large incidents that we responded to in the past, such as the tragedy with Humboldt Broncos,\" Blake Robert said, referring to a 2018 crash between a bus carrying a youth hockey team and a semi-trailer in Saskatchewan that led to the death of 16 people.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, RCMP Superintendent Rob Lasson said that officials in Manitoba had already \" linked into the investigators in Saskatchewan who have first-hand experience and were some of the primary investigators in the investigation into the Humboldt crash\".\n\nMembers of the Saskatchewan RCMP are now helping the investigation.", "Huanan Seafood Market has been linked to the first cases of Covid-19\n\nA research team in China has published analysis of samples taken more than three years ago from the market linked to the outbreak of Covid-19.\n\nThe Huanan seafood and wildlife market has been a focal point in the search for the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nBut this is the first peer-reviewed study of biological evidence gathered from the market back in 2020.\n\nBy linking the virus with animals sold in the market, it could open new lines of inquiry into how the outbreak began.\n\nThe research reveals swabs that tested positive for the virus also contained genetic material from wild animals.\n\nSome scientists say this is further evidence that the disease was initially transmitted from an infected animal to a human.\n\nBut others have urged caution in interpreting the findings and it remains unclear why it took three years for the genetic content of the samples to be made public.\n\nAnother theory has centred on the suggestion that the virus accidentally leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nThe Chinese research team posted an early version of their study online back in February 2022, but they did not publish the full genetic information that was contained in the samples gathered from the market.\n\nIn March this year, another international group of researchers shared their own assessment of what those crucial market swabs had revealed, after spotting that the genetic sequences had been posted on a scientific data-sharing website.\n\nThis new analysis, which has been validated by other scientists before being published in the journal Nature, includes more important detail about the content of those samples, which were collected from stalls, surfaces, cages and machinery inside the market.\n\nBefore the 2020 outbreak, scientists took photos of animals, including racoon dogs, being sold in the Huanan market\n\nThe Chinese research team's paper showed that some samples - collected from areas where wildlife was being sold - had tested positive for the virus.\n\nTheir analysis also showed that animals now known to be susceptible to the virus, particularly raccoon dogs, were being sold alive in those locations.\n\nBut the Chinese researchers have pointed out that their discoveries fall short of definitive proof of how the outbreak started.\n\n\"These environmental samples cannot prove that the animals were infected,\" the paper explains.\n\nThe possibility remains, it adds, that the virus was brought into the market by an infected person, rather than an animal.\n\nProf David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow, is a virologist who has been involved in the genetic investigation into the origin of SARS-CoV-2 since it emerged in 2020.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"The most important thing is that this very important dataset is now published and available for others to work on.\"\n\nBut he added that the contents of the samples were \"compelling evidence that animals there were probably infected with the virus\".\n\n\"It's the whole body of evidence that's important,\" he said.\n\n\"When you bring this together with the fact that the early Covid-19 cases in Wuhan are linked to the market, it's strong evidence that this is where a spillover from an animal in the market occurred.\"\n\nThe published findings come amid signs that the lab leak theory is gaining ground among authorities in the US.\n\nThe Chinese government has strenuously denied suggestions that the virus originated in a scientific facility, but the FBI said it now believes that scenario is the \"most likely\", as does the US Department of Energy.\n\nVarious US departments and agencies have investigated the mystery and produced differing conclusions, but on 1 March the FBI's director accused Beijing of \"doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate\", and disclosed the bureau had been convinced of the lab leak theory \"for quite some time now\".\n\nThe FBI has not made their findings public, which has frustrated some scientists.\n\nThe lead researcher of the new report, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) in Beijing, has been contacted by the BBC for comment.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The first minister said the UK government was trying to 'undermine devolution'\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has accused the UK government of sabotaging a pilot recycling scheme by excluding glass.\n\nGlass bottles were a key part of Scottish proposals for the deposit return scheme (DRS), due to start in March - ahead of other UK schemes.\n\nThe UK government agreed for the scheme to go ahead in Scotland, but said it wanted to ensure it \"aligned\" with plans in other nations.\n\nThe move casts doubt over whether the Scottish scheme can go ahead.\n\nMr Yousaf told the BBC: \"They're not just trying to scupper the DRS - they're trying to undermine devolution. We've seen it multiple times.\n\n\"Not only is it bad in terms of devolution and self government, it's really poor for the environment. If we don't include glass that's 600 million bottles that won't be moved from our streets, our beaches and our parks.\"\n\nThe drinks industry previously shared concerns about the scheme's readiness\n\nBBC Scotland's political editor Glenn Campbell said one source closely involved in the DRS had put the chances of it going ahead at 50/50.\n\nThe Scottish government is expected to take a couple of weeks to crunch the numbers before making a decision.\n\nThe scheme is aimed at increasing the number of single-use drinks bottles and cans that are recycled.\n\nIt means 20p will be added to the price of a single-use drinks container, which will be refunded to people who return it to a retailer or hospitality premises that offer single-use products.\n\nThe scheme was due to begin in August but was delayed following concerns from the drinks industry.\n\nSome firms feared it would place extra costs and other burdens on them at a time when they are already struggling.\n\nSimilar UK initiatives are expected in 2025 - with proposals in Wales including glass bottles.\n\nBecause Scottish ministers wanted to introduce their scheme sooner, they had to seek an exemption from the Internal Market Act.\n\nThe legislation was brought in after Brexit in a bid to ensure smooth trade across the different nations of the UK.\n\nThere had been concerns that the timing of a Scottish scheme could create a trade barrier.\n\nOn Saturday morning the UK government confirmed it had accepted the Scottish government's request \"on a temporary and limited basis\".\n\nThe exemption from internal market rules lasts from the launch of the Scottish scheme until other planned schemes are in place in the rest of the UK.\n\nScotland's DRS will cover PET plastic, aluminium, and steel cans only.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Deposit return schemes need to be consistent across the UK and this is the best way to provide a simple and effective system.\n\n\"A system with the same rules for the whole UK will increase recycling collection rates and reduce litter - as well as minimise disruption to the drinks industry and ensure simplicity for consumers.\"\n\nMr Yousaf previously claimed it would be a \"democratic outrage\" for the UK government to agree to the DRS excluding glass.\n\nHowever Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said the situation was a mess of the Scottish government's own making.\n\nHe said: \"Rather than trying to pick a fight, the SNP and Greens must now accept this help to create a deposit return scheme that actually works for the people of Scotland.\"\n\nLorna Slater had urged Westminster to \"do the right thing\" and allow the scheme to go ahead\n\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater, who had been driving the introduction of the DRS, said the Scottish Parliament had been \"treated with contempt\".\n\nThe decision to exclude glass meant she would have to look \"very seriously\" at the viability of the Scottish scheme, she said.\n\nMr Yousaf added that millions of pounds had been spent on a scheme that proposed to include glass.\n\nHe said he did not want to go ahead with a scheme that excluded glass, but would look at the various options.\n\nFor it to work effectively, the Scottish deposit return scheme needs an exemption from the rules of the UK internal market act.\n\nThe Scottish government has asked for that and - on the face of it - their request has now been granted by the UK government. So what's the problem?\n\nThere are strings attached. A tangle of conditions including the exclusion of glass that make the Scottish government wonder whether their proposals are still viable.\n\nUK ministers will argue they are acting on a practical basis, to ensure any Scottish scheme aligns with future developments in other parts of the UK.\n\nThere are certainly businesses that welcome their intervention and others that may have an axe to grind against government at some level, having shelled out to prepare for a scheme that would include glass.\n\nTo Scottish ministers this is a power play by the UK government - an outrageous interference in devolved decision making akin to the block on gender reform legislation and resistance to indyref2.\n\nThe British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) has said the \"only viable option now\" was for a UK-wide initiative to be launched across all four nations in 2025.\n\nDougal Sharp, founder of brewer Innis and Gunn, said uncertainty over the scheme made things \"brutal and impossible to plan\".\n\nBrewer Dougal Sharp said businesses had faced enough uncertainty in recent years\n\nHe said: \"Businesses are already spending a lot of money on this scheme in Scotland. It just feels like another twist and a very shambolic scheme implementation.\n\n\"We've already seen it delayed from August. All of these delays inevitably lead to weakened consumer confidence and particularly business confidence.\n\n\"Businesses cannot plan in this environment.

Watch: The battle for Bakhmut, a city in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, rages on\n\nUkraine has drawn a line in the dirt, and that line is Bakhmut. It is a city that few say matters strategically, but that tens of thousands have died fighting over. It began more than seven months ago, and is the longest battle of the war so far.\n\nTwo Ukrainian army brigades defending the city's southern flank gave the BBC access to their positions last week as fierce fighting continued in and around Bakhmut. The men have spent months facing both regular Russian army forces, and prisoners recruited by the Wagner private military group who have swarmed their trenches in droves. Troops say Russian casualties far outweigh theirs, but the enemy is deploying new techniques to try to seize the city and surrounding countryside.\n\nUkraine's forces are outgunned and outnumbered, but on a chalk hillside to the south, there is the anti-tank group from the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade. 3Storm - as they are known - are unyielding. They've dug trenches deep into the earth. Timber props supporting the roof shudder as Russian artillery lands in the near distance, and field mice scurry along duck boards. An antiquated field telephone sits in a wooden nook; these are conditions their grandfathers would recognise.\n\n\"They cannot get to us, we can see for a kilometre in all directions,\" says a bearded 26-year-old soldier who goes by the call sign \"Dwarf\", pointing out Russian positions. \"We can hit the enemy with everything we have,\" he says.\n\nThe 26-year-old goes by the call sign \"Dwarf\" as he's a big Lord of the Rings fan - although the name on the body armour actually translates as \"Gnome\"\n\nNeither the Russian nor Ukrainian armies release official casualty figures for Bakhmut, or elsewhere, but the mostly abandoned city has become a slaughter house.\n\nIn a week fighting for the city, Dwarf's company faced conscripted prisoners from Russia's Wagner group. \"We had battles every two hours,\" he says. \"I guess a single company eliminated 50 people per day.\" In case of any doubt, he points out these numbers were confirmed by aerial reconnaissance. \"The [Russian vehicle] arrives, 50 bodies come out, a day passes, 50 bodies come out again,\" he says. His company lost a fraction of that number, he says.\n\nOfficially, Ukraine estimates that for every one of its soldiers killed, Russia loses seven. Earlier this week, Russia said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members in a 24-hour period in the battle for Bakhmut. None of these numbers can be independently verified.\n\nIn a newspaper interview, two captured Wagner conscripts told the Wall Street Journal that before they are sent forward, they receive little training beyond learning to crawl through forests in the dark. After six months serving at the front they are freed - assuming they survive.\n\nConditions all along the 600-mile-long eastern front have begun to change. 3Storm's chalky hilltop hideout feels like dry land compared with the surrounding territory. An early spring has turned the hard ground of winter to mud porridge - which may favour the defenders. To get there, we had to follow the Ukrainian soldiers on foot - within a few paces my boots become lumpen and heavy with thick dirt. A battlefield ambulance speeds by unsteadily, its caterpillar tracks ploughing up the ground, and spraying pools of sludge as it struggles for grip.\n\nThe villages around here - the location can't be revealed - are in ruin. Handwritten signs on gates, mostly in Russian, announce \"People Live Here\", a plea as much as it is a statement. But the streets are entirely empty, apart from abandoned dogs who roam the ruins of destroyed farms and homes.\n\nFor the past two months, Russian forces have steadily advanced, trying to encircle Bakhmut. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, says his forces will continue to resist. \"Every day of steadfast resistance wins us valuable time to reduce the enemy's offensive capabilities,\" he says, sending more reinforcements to the area. But it isn't only Russians who have fallen into the Bakhmut trap. Ukrainians are dying there, too, in ever increasing numbers.\n\nOn the hillside, a group of soldiers have gathered around a gun position, and I ask Dwarf - given that Ukraine is losing soldiers to untrained Russian convicts - if the defence of dead city, surrounded by the enemy, makes sense.\n\nHe says, \"I was wondering, myself, if we should keep defending Bakhmut. On the one hand what's happening here now is awful. There are no words to describe it. But the alternative is we give up Bakhmut and move to another settlement. What's the difference between defending Bakhmut or any other village?\"\n\nHis comrade, a strongly built man with a full dark beard who goes by the call sign Holm, agrees. \"It's not a strategic question for us here. We are ordinary soldiers. But this is our land. We may then retreat to Chasiv Yar, from Chasiv Yar to Slovyansk, and so we retreat up to Kyiv. Let it take a year or two, four, five - but we have to fight for every piece of our land.\"\n\nThe men have been fighting for more than a year now, and they say the Russians are evolving.\n\n\"They are learning, they are getting cleverer, and it really freaks me out,\" says Dwarf. \"They send out a group - five morons taken from prison. They are shot, but the enemy sees where you are, walks around, and you are surrounded from behind.\"\n\nHolm chimes in that Russia is now using drones armed with grenades more effectively. \"We used to drop them and freak them out,\" he says. \"Now they're dropping drone grenades on our positions.\"\n\nBefore the war, Dwarf was an outdoor youth worker and would take youngsters hiking in the Carpathian Mountains on the country's western edge. Here on Ukraine's eastern front, that is a far-off memory. He's been in many battles since then, but the horror of Bakhmut is what lives with him now.\n\nWhen I ask about Wagner's convict army, he pauses to think and says, \"I'll be honest. It's genius. Cruel, immoral, but effective tactics. It worked out. And it's still working in Bakhmut.\"\n\nSoviet-era UAZ jeep makes it way through the mud\n\nDays later, I'm back in the same area, crammed with four others into a Soviet-era UAZ jeep. Its steering wheel has the BMW logo - a joke says the driver, Oleg. He says little else as he grips the wheel and concentrates hard as the car whines and struggles over hills and through the shoals of muck. The automatic gunfire ahead signals we are nearing the 28th Mechanised Brigade, who are directly facing the Russians.\n\nThe landscape of war shifts in an instant - the men are holed up in a small wood, its trees shattered and split by Russian fire. In a month, the wood will offer them cover. For now, its bare branches expose them to surveillance drones. Nearby there's an exchange of gunfire, and Russian shells strike around 500m away. But Borys, a 48-year-old former architect who is serving now as a captain, seems untroubled.\n\n\"Today's war is a drone war,\" he says, \"but we can walk around freely, because there's wind and rain today and drones are blown away. If it was quiet today, both our drones and our enemy's would be hovering over us.\"\n\nOn the way back, Oleg brings the jeep to a sudden halt. Lying in the dirt in front of us is a drone that has been blown off course. Its battery is quickly removed and it is brought inside - it turns out to be Ukrainian.\n\nBut today's war isn't so very different from the past.\n\nTwo nights before, the 28th Brigade was attacked by Russian infantry and tanks. In a timbered gun position below ground, the cold rain drips through the roof onto the dirt floor, and there, peering out into the bare landscape, is a Maxim belt-fed machine gun with stout iron wheels.\n\n\"It only works when there is a massive attack going on\u2026then it really works,\" says Borys. \"So we use it every week\".\n\nAnd this is how the battle for Bakhmut is being fought, as winter turns to spring in 21st Century Europe. A 19th Century weapon still mows down men by the score in the black Ukrainian earth.", "Emile Soleil had been dropped off at his grandparents' house hours before he went missing\n\nAlmost nine months after a two-and-a-half year-old boy disappeared in a tiny village in the French Alps, some of his bones have been found by a hiker in an area that had already been searched.\n\nDetectives now have to find out whether Emile Soleil's death was an accident or if he was the victim of a crime.\n\nHis unexplained disappearance in Haut-Vernet shocked France last July.\n\nThe discovery of his remains more than 1km away came days after police returned to re-enact what had happened.\n\nA communique from local prosecutors did not specify which bones had been found, but they were understood to include Emile's skull and some teeth. Forensic teams are now searching for the rest of his body.\n\nLocal Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Balique said he was very sad at the discovery and his thoughts were with Emile's parents. \"It will take a long time to recover from this disappearance and death,\" he told French radio.\n\nEmile had only just been dropped off to stay at his grandparents' holiday home when he vanished in the Alpine hamlet on the slopes of the Massif des Trois-Ev\u00each\u00e9s mountain range. Only 25 people live in Haut-Vernet, at an altitude of 1,200m (4,000ft), and his parents were not there when he disappeared.\n\nThe last sighting of the child, wearing a yellow t-shirt and white shorts, was at 17:15 local time on 8 July by two neighbours who saw him walking by himself in the only street in the village but then said they had \"lost sight of him\".\n\nPolice were alerted by his grandmother shortly afterwards. Hundreds of people joined police with sniffer-dogs in a search the following day and two investigating judges were quickly appointed to the case, which was by then a major national story.\n\nEmile's disappearance soon became a criminal inquiry into a potential abduction, although detectives did not have any further leads into what had happened.\n\nThe boy's parents, who are religious Catholics, said they feared the worst but told a Christian website they still hoped for a miracle.\n\nHis mother made a public appeal in November, marking what would have been Emile's third birthday. If he was still alive, she appealed for his safe return, but if he was dead, she asked that he be handed back for burial.\n\nOnly 25 people live in Haut-Vernet where Emile disappeared\n\nLast Thursday investigators returned to Haut-Vernet, summoning 17 people including members of Emile's family, neighbours and witnesses, to reconstruct the last sightings of the boy.\n\nFrench reports have focused on the boy's 58-year-old maternal grandfather, but his lawyer said she hoped investigators would not \"waste too much time on him to the detriment of other lines of inquiry\".\n\nThen, on Saturday, a woman found the bones in an area that police said had been searched several times by local residents, police and helicopters with thermal cameras. Forensic scientists announced on Sunday that the DNA matched Emile's.\n\n\"This heart-breaking news was feared, and the time has come for mourning, contemplation and prayer,\" the child's parents said in a statement.\n\nPolice are investigating why the small skull had not been detected earlier. A local woman is said to have made the find while walking in a steep, wooded area that is not easy to access and then handed it over to local gendarmes (military police).\n\nMarie-Laure Pezant, a spokeswoman for the gendarmerie told French TV that the bones could have been placed there by a person or even an animal, or they could even have been shifted by changing weather conditions.\n\nEqually, police are not ruling out the possibility that his remains were missed during searches last summer because of the dense undergrowth at the time.\n\n\"Is that where he disappeared? Is that where he took his last breath, nobody knows,\" said Mayor Fran\u00e7ois Balique. \"In any case I have no idea, but the judicial inquiry will no doubt be able to find that out.\"\n\nSniffer-dogs have been searching the area for more remains and dozens of police are guarding the site to prevent a potential crime scene being contaminated in any way by hikers.\n\n\"We're looking for any trace and any clue,\" police commander Pierre-Yves Bardy told reporters on Monday, adding that the search would go on for as long as necessary.\n\nA source told Le Figaro newspaper of their frustration that the woman had picked up the skull: \"It would have been better if she hadn't touched anything.\"", "Last updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nEngland sealed a Six Nations Grand Slam in front of a record women's crowd of 58,498 at Twickenham, holding on for victory against France on a landmark day for the sport.\n\nAfter a nervy start, Helena Rowland broke free in midfield and Abby Dow tore down the right wing to score and further fuel the already festival-like atmosphere in the London sun.\n\nWith the hosts seemingly settled, four more tries followed for a 33-0 half-time lead in England women's first standalone Test at the ground.\n\nThat proved enough to secure a fifth Six Nations title in a row, but the Red Roses could not push on after the break and it was France who scored five tries to their one.\n\nThe announcement of the attendance - surpassing the previous mark of 42,579 set at the 2022 World Cup final in New Zealand - breathed joy back into the air and Twickenham was on its feet dancing to celebrate at full-time.\n\nIn Simon Middleton's last game as head coach, England bounced back from a heart-breaking World Cup final defeat by New Zealand less than six months ago.\n\nIt was a familiar line-up for a Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider, but Twickenham gameday had a whole new feel.\n\nTravelling to the ground, a smattering of England shirts at various stations across London became a swarm on the slow march to the stadium - a sight never before seen for a women's game.\n\nInitial England nerves led to a cagey, kicking-heavy gameplan and early penalties conceded by the hosts in dangerous positions.\n\nFrance's Jessy Tremouliere missed a kick at goal and when she kicked the next penalty to the corner, England heaved France's maul backwards and eventually won possession on the floor.\n\nThe visitors' steely attack was met with physical England defence and, against the run of play, the Red Roses got on the scoreboard in the 18th minute.\n\nRowland tore into France's half, propelled by a wall of sound she would never have experienced in her career before, but looked to be out on her own.\n\nEngland quickly flicked the ball right and found wing Dow - the Red Roses' perpetual superstar.\n\nNo amount of nerves could stop her from scoring, leaving the stadium quite literally bouncing.\n\nSettled and with the floodgates open, Holly Aitchison put in-form centre Tatyana Heard through a gap and when England captain Marlie Packer then got her hands on the ball, even three France defenders could not bring her down.\n\nThe retiring Tremouliere had time for one last yellow card of her career, sin-binned in the 32nd minute for a deliberate knock-on and Alex Matthews was soon over off the back of a dominant scrum.\n\nThen, France prop Rose Bernadou joined Tremouliere in the sin-bin for an infringement at the breakdown which gave England a penalty try.\n\nIt had largely been England's backs - corralled by scrum-half Lucy Packer's controlled performance - delivering the points courtesy of the Red Roses' brawn up front.\n\nBut Sarah Beckett showed the pack had deft feet too as she cut a neat line inside and sent lock partner Zoe Aldcroft into space to score before half-time.\n\nAny thoughts of a possible record score against France to match the record crowd were soon snuffed out as Emilie Boulard's try kicked off a bombardment.\n\nEngland showed cracks in their defence and discipline and Gabrielle Vernier exploited the crevices, nipping through a gap and across the tryline to bamboozled murmurs from the crowd.\n\nWith the try tap seemingly turned off, England had to weather the pressure and did just that as they doggedly worked through phases in France's half.\n\nWhen all else fails, the Red Roses have a deadly maul and that is where they turned for their sixth try as Lark Davies touched down.\n\nStill France kept going, as Charlotte Escudero scored off a line-out and both Emeline Gros and Cyrielle Banet snuck across the tryline in the final four minutes, with England apparently already celebrating their victory.\n\nThe Red Roses' earlier work was enough to secure a fitting end as they claimed their 12th win in a row against France, a 100th win in the Six Nations and departing coach Middleton's sixth title in the tournament.\n\nCaptain Marlie Packer raised the newly designed trophy aloft as the vast majority of fans stayed behind to celebrate on a historic day at Twickenham.\n\n'I am super proud' - what they said\n\nEngland captain Marlie Packer told BBC Two: \"I am super proud. The whole squad in this Six Nations has got us to where we are today and it is amazing.\n\n\"We knew France would be tough, they played to the 80th minute and kept asking questions of us, so credit to them.\n\n\"Simon's team talk just then had me in tears. He has been amazing for what he has done for women's rugby.\"\n\n'An exceptional day I will never forget'\n\nEngland head coach Simon Middleton on his final match in charge: \"You couldn't wish for more than this. It's been an honour and privilege to do this job. I have been very lucky.\n\n\"The girls should be massively proud of what they are doing. I am so proud.\n\n\"To produce a game like that on a stage like this is everything that is good about the game. It's been incredible. It's a great learning experience that second half and they will continue to grow.\n\n\"This game has given me more than I've ever dreamed of. It's been an exceptional day that I will never forget.\n\n\"You live for moments like lifting the trophy.\"\n\n'The sky is the limit'\n\nEngland flanker Sadia Kabeya: \"It's been an absolutely amazing tournament and today we got the result we needed in front of a brilliant crowd. It's been an amazing day at Twickenham.\n\n\"It was definitely a game of two halves but we stuck to it and our gameplan.\n\n\"The only way is up for us.

It paid off,\" said Boulter, who hit 37 winners against Tomova and converted five of 15 break points.\n\n\"She is a top player and I expected her to come back with an even better game. She definitely did and made me play more balls.\n\n\"I tried to be as aggressive as possible and managed to do that at the start of the third set.\"\n\nIn front of a buoyant crowd on court 12, Boulter enjoyed another memorable day in a British grass-court season in which she has climbed back into the world's top 100.\n\nNow ranked 89th, she is the leading home hope in the women's singles, having replaced Emma Raducanu - who is missing the event after wrist and ankle surgeries - as British number one.\n\nSuccess in Nottingham, where she won her first WTA title, meant Boulter came into Wimbledon full of confidence that she could produce another strong showing on the biggest stage of all.\n\nThriving under the spotlight, she has matched last year's run to the third round.\n\nWhether Boulter can go even further remains to be seen, and Rybakina will be a considerable step up in class on the other side of the net.\n\n\"I think I'm playing really well. I've played a lot of matches on the grass. I feel very comfortable,\" Boulter added.\n\n\"A lot of it is my self-belief. A lot of matches recently I've really drawn from it to help me get over the line.

Watch: Danish reporters film armed men on guard as they approach the Admiral Vladimirsky\n\nRussia has a programme to sabotage wind farms and communication cables in the North Sea, according to new allegations.\n\nThe details come from a joint investigation by public broadcasters in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.\n\nIt says Russia has a fleet of vessels disguised as fishing trawlers and research vessels in the North Sea.\n\nThey carry underwater surveillance equipment and are mapping key sites for possible sabotage.\n\nThe BBC understands that UK officials are aware of Russian vessels moving around UK waters as part of the programme.\n\nThe first of a series of reports is due to be broadcast on Wednesday by DR in Denmark, NRK in Norway, SVT in Sweden and Yle in Finland.\n\nThe report focuses on a Russian vessel called the Admiral Vladimirsky\n\nA Danish counter-intelligence officer says the sabotage plans are being prepared in case of a full conflict with the West while the head of Norwegian intelligence told the broadcasters the programme was considered highly important for Russia and controlled directly from Moscow.\n\nThe broadcasters say they have analysed intercepted Russian communications which indicate so-called ghost ships sailing in Nordic waters which have turned off the transmitters so as not to reveal their locations.\n\nThe report focuses on a Russian vessel called the Admiral Vladimirsky. Officially, this is an Expeditionary Oceanographic Ship, or underwater research vessel. But the report alleges that it is in fact a Russian spy ship.\n\nThe documentary uses an anonymous former UK Royal Navy expert to track the movements of the vessel in the vicinity of seven wind farms off the coast of the UK and the Netherlands on one mission.\n\nIt says the vessel slows down when it approaches areas where there are wind farms and loiters in the area. It says it sailed for a month with its transmitter turned off.\n\nWhen a reporter approached the ship on a small boat, he was confronted by a masked individual carrying what appeared to be a military assault rifle.\n\nThe same ship was reportedly sighted off the Scottish coast last year. It was spotted entering the Moray Firth on 10 November and seen about 30 nautical miles east of Lossiemouth, home to the RAF's Maritime Patrol Aircraft fleet before heading slowly west.\n\nThe BBC understands that UK officials are aware of Russian intent to conduct what is known as undersea mapping, including using boats that move around in UK waters.\n\nIf there are specific threats against the UK these would be investigated, but sources declined to say what activity might have been looked at so far.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The head of the country's military intelligence said a Russian ship had been detected near a wind farm in the North Sea and was mapping out sites.\n\n\"We saw in recent months Russian actors tried to uncover how the energy system works in the North Sea. It is the first time we have seen this,\" General Jan Swillens said.\n\nReconnaissance of sensitive sites is not unusual and Western countries will likely be carrying out similar activity against Russia. The intention is likely to have a series of options available should a conflict escalate.\n\nOne option might be to damage communications or take down countries' power systems to cause chaos.\n\nSo far the evidence of actual sabotage rather than just intelligence gathering for the possibility is more limited.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian officials dismissed the claims in the documentary as baseless, AFP news agency reported.\n\nThe filmmakers approached Russian ambassadors in four Nordic countries for comment - but only Norway's responded.\n\nTeimuraz Ramishvili told them that Norwegian authorities had made a habit of accusing Russia of espionage, hacker attacks and other undercover operations without providing any evidence.\n\nHe insisted that Russian vessels were following Norwegian rules and had the right to sail in Norwegian waters.\n\nThe report raises the possibility that such vessels were linked to an incident south of Svalbard last year when an underwater data cable was cut.\n\nThe cable served the world largest commercial ground station for satellite communications. Norwegian police have said they believe \"human activity\" was behind the sabotage but have not officially accused anyone.\n\nOn 13 April this year, Norway expelled 15 Russian officials, accusing them of spying. It was the latest in a wave of expulsions across Europe since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn October last year police declared a major incident in the Shetland Islands after a cable was cut.\n\nThe incident severely hampered communications with the mainland and was blamed at the time as having been probably caused by \"fishing vessels\". Cables are regularly cut by accident and so far the BBC understands this is not thought to have been the result of hostile activity.\n\nThere had been one clear and significant act of sabotage and that was the destruction last September of parts of the Nord Stream pipeline designed to carry gas from Russia to Europe.\n\nAt the time, many accused Russia of being responsible but since then other reports have suggested other possibilities, including pro-Ukrainian actors, and investigations are ongoing.\n\nRussian military intelligence, the GRU, has also been linked to both sabotage and poisonings.

unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.\n\nFirst published last month, it received initial backing by 268 to 70 votes after several hours of debate in the House of Commons on Monday.\n\nMuch of the debate on the issue has focused on boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israel settlements - similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era.\n\nSuch boycotts are backed by Palestinians who see them as applying pressure on Israel to end its military occupation.\n\nThe Israeli government, on the other hand, sees the entire BDS movement as unjustly singling out Israel and describes it as antisemitic.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said there had been an \"increase in antisemitic events following on from the activities of the BDS movement\".\n\nHe added that although there were \"legitimate reasons to criticise the Israeli government\", the BDS movement was asking councils to \"treat Israel differently from any other nation on the globe\".\n\n\"Nothing in this bill prevents or impedes the loudest of criticisms of Israel's government and leaders,\" he added.\n\nBut Labour - and a number of Conservative MPs - raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on UK foreign policy.\n\nDame Margaret Hodge, who served in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the proposed legislation was \"flawed, poorly drafted and will have damaging consequences both here and abroad\".\n\n\"The bill is not a considered attempt to bring about peace, provide better security for Israel or respond to the threats posed by BDS,\" she said.\n\n\"It's about using Jews as a pawn in the government's political game.\"\n\nConservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government must remove references to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories from the bill.\n\nShe said the bill \"essentially gives exceptional impunity to Israel\", adding: \"This is something we should not give to any country and I would be standing here making the same request if any country was named.\"\n\nLongstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated \"two-state solution\".\n\nThe UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an \"obstacle to peace\".\n\nThe bill does not stop public bodies from complying with UK-wide sanctions, and it gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions.\n\nFor example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted.\n\nBut the bill does not allow the rules to exempt Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights.\n\nIn doing so, it groups the three territories together, which critics including Labour argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law.\n\nCritics have also raised concerns that the bill would limit campaigns against human rights abuses in other parts of the world - such as against the Uyghur in Xinjiang, China.\n\nAhead of the vote on Monday, the government spokesperson said: \"Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda.\n\n\"The bill will not hinder the robust action we are taking against Uyghur forced labour in supply chains as it contains exceptions to the ban for labour related misconduct, including modern slavery.\n\n\"The ban on boycotts does not apply to individuals, including publicly elected officials, when carrying out private acts that are protected by the Human Rights Act.\"\n\nA Labour amendment to the bill was defeated in the Commons by 272 votes to 212 - a margin of 60.\n\nThe amendment had sought to decline the bill a second reading over concerns it \"risks significantly undermining support\" for groups around the world facing persecution, for example the Uyghur, who are \"currently victims of grave and systemic human rights abuses\".\n\nIt said it opposed any \"discrimination\" by public bodies in how they spend their money and says all public bodies must act \"without bias\" when making decisions on procurement and investment.", "A woman hit by a police motorcycle escorting Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, through London has died.\n\nThe family of 81-year-old Helen Holland, from Birchanger in Essex, said she fought \"for her life for nearly two weeks... but irreversible damage to her brain finally ended the battle\".\n\nBuckingham Palace said the duchess was \"deeply saddened\" and sent her \"deepest condolences\" to all the family.\n\nThe police watchdog is investigating the crash.\n\nMs Holland had been in London visiting her sister when she was struck at the junction of West Cromwell Road and Warwick Road in Earl's Court on 10 May.\n\nFollowing the crash, her family said she was in a coma, and on Friday the police said she remained in a critical condition.\n\nAnnouncing her death, her son, Martin Holland, said his mother had died after \"suffering multiple broken bones and massive internal injuries\".\n\nSophie, who is married to the King's youngest brother, will get in touch privately with Ms Holland's family.\n\nShe gained the title of Duchess of Edinburgh when her husband Prince Edward took on a new role in March.\n\nSophie is deeply saddened by Helen Holland's death, the palace says\n\nChief Supt Richard Smith, head of the Metropolitan Police's Royalty and Specialist Protection Unit, said the \"tragic outcome is being felt by colleagues across the Met\" and \"thoughts are very much with the woman's family and loved ones\".\n\n\"Officers know that their actions, both on and off duty, are open to scrutiny and following our referral of the incident, the IOPC launched an independent investigation -

Chan Po Ying, a veteran pro-democracy activist who heads the League of Social Democrats party, was holding an LED candle and two flowers.\n\nMak Yin Ting, former head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, was also detained and subsequently released. Police later said they had made one arrest and taken 23 people to police stations for investigation.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Volker Turk, said on Twitter that he was alarmed by the detentions and called for the release of \"anyone detained for exercising freedom of expression and peaceful assembly\".\n\nEvents to mark the 1989 massacre in Beijing are banned in mainland China.\n\nFor decades, Hong Kong was the only Chinese city where these commemorations were allowed, under the city's semi-autonomous economic, political and legal set up - known as \"one country, two systems\" - established when the city handed over to China by the UK in 1997.\n\nBut public events to mark the anniversary have since been outlawed, after the Chinese government imposed a strict national security law outlawing many forms of dissent in 2020.\n\nThe annual commemorations have not been held since 2019, after being initially banned under Hong Kong's Covid regulations.\n\nThis year, a pro-Beijing carnival is being held in Victoria Park instead.\n\nMs Wong was quickly surrounded by police and driven away on Sunday in the city's Causeway Bay area.\n\nNearby Victoria Park has hosted annual candlelit vigils to mark Tiananmen Square since 1990, often drawing tens of thousands of people to mark the day, known as June Fourth in much of China.\n\nPolice detain a man holding a script titled \"May 35th\", a reference to the 4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing\n\nHong Kong Police have deployed thousands of officers at key sites in the city, stopping people to search and question them.\n\nOfficers set up booths outside the metro station near Victoria Park to search passers-by, including journalists.\n\nTwo Chinese-made \"Sabre-tooth Tiger\" armoured vehicles have also be stationed in the area in what appears to be a show of force by police.\n\nAhead of anticipated protests, the city's government has also removed books on the Tiananmen crackdown from public libraries.\n\nOne of those detained was a woman who shouted \"Raise candles! Mourn 64!\" while another was a man carrying a book with the title \"May 35th\" - both references to the 4 June date of the killings.\n\nOthers have been detained while holding unlit candles or wearing yellow clothing, the colour of the now-dismantled pro-democracy movement.\n\nOn Saturday, four people were arrested on suspicion of disturbing order in a public place or acting with seditious intent - both new offences under the controversial 2020 law.\n\nDozens of candlelight vigils have been taking place around the world on Sunday to remember those killed by the Chinese military in response to the crackdown.\n\nIn Taiwan, the democratic, self-governing island China claims as its territory and has vowed to take control of by force if necessary, hundreds of people gathered to mark the anniversary.\n\nChants of \"fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\" were heard from the crowds in the capital, Taipei, who had set up a replica of the \"Pillar of Shame\" - a famous statue at the University of Hong Kong commemorating the dead at Tiananmen Square that was removed in 2021.\n\nThere was also a protest in central London\n\nMany involved also hope the vigils will continue the spirit of Hong Kong's once-vibrant civil society and political community, which has now largely fallen silent because so many have been imprisoned under the national security law, or have left Hong Kong altogether.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing became the focus for national demonstrations calling for greater political freedoms in 1989.\n\nThousands of people - the majority of which were students - camped for weeks in the iconic Beijing square before the military moved in on 4 June and opened fire.\n\nOne unidentified protester became an international symbol of protest for blocking an advancing column of tanks in footage that was seen around the world.\n\nThe Chinese government says 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel died. Other estimates have ranged from hundreds to as many as 10,000.\n\nThe actions of the authorities have been seen by activists as part of China's broader agenda to snuff out political dissent in Hong Kong.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "The chief executive of the Post Office, Nick Read, will return part of his \u00a3450,000 bonus for last year, after a rebuke from the chairman of the inquiry into the Horizon computer scandal.\n\nIn its financial accounts for last year the Post Office said its executives had met all their obligations to support the inquiry into the system.\n\nBut the inquiry is still taking place.\n\nThey also wrongly said inquiry chairman Sir Wyn Williams had approved bonuses relating to that support.\n\nMr Read apologised for what he described as \"unacceptable errors\".\n\nIn a letter to the inquiry chairman, Mr Read admitted the firm had made an \"incorrect statement\" in its accounts.\n\nThe Horizon inquiry is investigating how hundreds of sub-postmasters became victims of a vast miscarriage of justice.\n\nThey were blamed for discrepancies in their sub-post office's finances and prosecuted, with many receiving prison sentences, criminal records or going bankrupt. The discrepancies were down to the Post Office's glitch-prone IT system, called Horizon.\n\nIn the Post Office's annual accounts for last year published on 1 March, there was a target for executives defined as: \"All required evidence and information supplied on time, with confirmation from Sir Wyn Williams and team that Post Office's performance supported and enabled the Inquiry to finish in line with expectations\".\n\nThe metric was marked as '\"achieved\" although at the time the bonuses were agreed the inquiry was still in its first phase. It is likely to continue until 2024.\n\nAfter a lawyer acting on behalf of Sir Wyn questioned the accounts, the Post Office issued a statement apologising for the \"inappropriate sub-metric related to the Horizon IT Inquiry\".\n\nIn a letter addressed personally to Sir Wyn, Mr Read apologised and said he would return the remuneration associated with that sub-metric.\n\nThe Post Office board is considering whether other members of the leadership should do the same.\n\nThe inquiry has heard moving testimony from dozens of sub-postmasters who were falsely accused of fraud. Hundreds lost their livelihoods, were stigmatised in their communities, and some sent to prison.\n\nDozens of convictions have now been overturned in the courts, but many of those wrongly convicted are still awaiting compensation.\n\nThe next phase of the inquiry due to start next month will look at the action taken against the sub-postmasters, and knowledge of and responsibility for failures in investigation. A later phase will explore governance including whistleblowing over the scandal.\n\nMr Read said in his letter that he regretted the errors made particularly against the background of \"deeply concerning\" evidence presented to the inquiry.\n\nHe added: \"Our clear intent remains to offer full and fair compensation as quickly as possible and we are doing all we can to work with the government to achieve that.\"", "As we approach the end of the programme, Alastair Campbell says there's a real danger that the UK will be reduced to to the third and fourth tier of international relations.\n\n\"I honestly believe this is one of the biggest acts of self harm we as a country have ever inflicted on ourselves,\" he says, adding that the next generation has a right to undo what their predecessors did.\n\nBen Habib, the former Brexit Party MEP, says the country has to leave the EU as one United Kingdom.\n\nThe Windsor Framework needs to be ditched and 1.8 million British citizens need to be brought back into the UK, he says.\n\nAsked what he would do with the border, he says the border is recognised in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nHe accuses Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar of weaponising the border.\n\nHe says there is a border in the middle of the United Kingdom, which is an \"abomination to me\".", "A video still from the fatal Paris traffic stop shooting\n\nProsecutors have begun piecing together what happened before the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Nahel M by a police officer.\n\nThe officer has been charged with homicide and remains in custody.\n\nIn their outline of events after questioning eyewitnesses and reviewing CCTV footage, prosecutors say the teenage driver had already ignored a police demand to stop, when officers caught up with the car and drew their weapons.\n\nMeanwhile an account has been posted online by one of the passengers, which French media say they have verified but the BBC has not.\n\nIn this account the passenger, also a teenager, says the officers hit Nahel M with the butts of their guns three times, causing him to take his foot off the brake of the car.\n\nProsecutors are due to talk to this witness on Monday.\n\nAround 08:00 on Tuesday, two policemen on motorcycles spotted a Mercedes with a Polish number plate driving fast in a bus lane, Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache told journalists.\n\nTurning on their siren, the officers caught up with the car at a traffic light. Three young men were inside.\n\nThe officers told the driver to stop but the vehicle pulled away, ignoring the red light. The officers gave chase and notified their unit by radio.\n\nAt 08:16, the Mercedes stopped in heavy traffic. Both officers got off their motorcycles, drew their weapons and approached the car.\n\nThey later told prosecutors that they pointed their guns at the driver to \"deter him from driving away again\".\n\nThey asked the driver to turn off the ignition, but the car moved forward. One of the officers fired, fatally wounding the young man in the chest.\n\nAfter the car ran into a roadside barrier, one of the passengers was arrested and the other fled on foot.\n\nThe passenger says the three friends were driving around Nanterre when the car strayed into the bus lane and was chased by two policemen on motorcycles.\n\nAfter Nahel stopped the car, the young man says in his video and in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, one of the officers hit the teenage driver with the butt of his gun.\n\nHe alleges that the second policeman also struck Nahel before the first officer again hit him.\n\nHe told Le Parisien that the blows left Nahel M \"a little stunned\".\n\nThe third blow, according to this account, caused Nahel to take his foot off the brake and the vehicle to move forward. After the officer fired, Nahel M slumped forward and his foot pressed on the accelerator, the passenger said.\n\nWhen the car came a standstill, the passenger said, he decided to flee because he was afraid he would be shot too.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the car, a Mercedes A class AMG. Officials describe it as a rented vehicle.\n\nThe passenger who fled said that someone had lent it to the three youths, without giving any details.\n\nAccording to the French motoring website Autoplus, German sportscars with Polish number plates can be hired for \u20ac300-3,000 (\u00a3260-2,600) a day.\n\nThis type of short rental is popular with young men in French housing estates, Autoplus says.\n\nNahel M did not have a criminal record but was known to police.\n\nHe had previously been cited for driving without a licence - he was too young to have one - and for refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nHe was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.", "Amin Nasser is the president and CEO of Aramco, the world's second-most valuable company behind Apple\n\nSaudi oil giant Aramco has announced a record profit of $161.1bn (\u00a3134bn) for 2022, helped by soaring energy prices and bigger volumes.\n\nIt represents a 46.5% rise for the state-owned company, compared with last year.\n\nIt is the latest energy firm to report record profits, after energy prices spiked following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAramco also declared a dividend of $19.5bn for the October to December quarter of 2022, to be paid in the first quarter of this year.\n\nMost of that will go to the Saudi government, which owns nearly 95% of the shares in the company.\n\nBrent crude oil, the benchmark oil price, now trades at around $82 a barrel - though prices exceeded $120 a barrel last March, after Russia's invasion, and June.\n\n\"Aramco rode the wave of high energy prices in 2022,\" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"It would have been difficult for Aramco not to perform strongly in 2022.\"\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Aramco said the company results were \"underpinned by stronger crude oil prices, higher volumes sold and improved margins for refined products\".\n\nAramco's president and CEO Amin Nasser said: \"Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real - including contributing to higher energy prices.\"\n\nTo address those challenges, he said, the company would not only focus on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production - but also invest in new lower-carbon technologies.\n\nAramco - the world's second-most valuable company only behind America's Apple - is a major emitter of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.\n\nResponding to Aramco's announcement, Amnesty International's secretary general Agn\u00e8s Callamard said: \"It is shocking for a company to make a profit of more than $161bn in a single year through the sale of fossil fuel - the single largest driver of the climate crisis.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is all the more shocking because this surplus was amassed during a global cost-of-living crisis and aided by the increase in energy prices resulting from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).\n\nThe Gulf kingdom has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents, and for the widespread use of capital punishment.\n\nIn a separate development on Sunday, Iran said its oil exports had reached their highest level since the re-imposition of US sanctions in 2018.\n\nOil Minister Javad Owji said exports increased by 83 million barrels in 2022 compared with the previous 12 months. In Iran, a new year starts in March.\n\nAnalysts say the rise is due to greater shipments to Iranian allies China and Venezuela.\n\nTehran's export revenues took a significant hit after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal five years ago.\n\nThe US sanctions, coupled with economic mismanagement and corruption, have meant that the Iranian economy has not had any substantive growth in the past decade. And by some measures, it is still 4-8% smaller than it was back in 2010.", "Pavel Kuzin was killed in Bakhmut amid brutal fighting around the eastern Ukrainian city\n\nStaff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.\n\nThe Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.\n\nPavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"\n\nHlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.\n\nUkrainians are trying to fight off Russia's human wave attacks - similar to tactics used during World War One\n\nA number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\".\n\nLast month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.\n\nOften these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.\n\nThese wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.\n\nUkrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.\n\nAlso, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.\n\nThat was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.\n\nTsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.\n\n\"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\"\n\nNext to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.\n\nBy that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.\n\nCommanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.\n\nThe next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.\n\n\"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.\n\nPavel Kuzin died holding off Russian attackers so his wounded fellow soldiers could be evacuated\n\nRussian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.\n\n\"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"\n\nUkraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\"\n\nPalamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived. The whole operation over just a kilometre's distance lasted for six hours.\n\nIt was past midnight but the entire battalion gathered at the evacuation point to pay their respects to Pavel, who is survived by his daughter and wife.\n\n\"It was a huge loss for our unit,\" Palamarchuk says. \"He saved two people but died himself.\"", "A picture shows the Jewish settlement of Kedar in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in June 2023\n\nThe government has been urged to rethink its plans to fine public bodies which initiate boycotts against Israel.\n\nThe proposals received initial backing but have been met with criticism from both Conservative and Labour MPs.\n\nCommunities Secretary Michael Gove said the bill would guarantee foreign policy remained a UK government matter.\n\nBut Labour says the bill undermines the UK's longstanding foreign policy towards the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe party warned the bill also risked undermining support for people around the world facing persecution, as well as placing \"unprecedented restrictions\" on elected councils, undermining freedom of speech and having potential \"widespread and negative impacts\" on local authority pension funds.\n\nThe Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill seeks to prevent public bodies, including councils, from campaigning against, boycotting or sanctioning a particular international territory - unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy.\n\nFirst published last month, it received initial backing by 268 to 70 votes after several hours of debate in the House of Commons on Monday.\n\nMuch of the debate on the issue has focused on boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israel settlements - similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era.\n\nSuch boycotts are backed by Palestinians who see them as applying pressure on Israel to end its military occupation.\n\nThe Israeli government, on the other hand, sees the entire BDS movement as unjustly singling out Israel and describes it as antisemitic.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said there had been an \"increase in antisemitic events following on from the activities of the BDS movement\".\n\nHe added that although there were \"legitimate reasons to criticise the Israeli government\", the BDS movement was asking councils to \"treat Israel differently from any other nation on the globe\".\n\n\"Nothing in this bill prevents or impedes the loudest of criticisms of Israel's government and leaders,\" he added.\n\nBut Labour - and a number of Conservative MPs - raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on UK foreign policy.\n\nDame Margaret Hodge, who served in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the proposed legislation was \"flawed, poorly drafted and will have damaging consequences both here and abroad\".\n\n\"The bill is not a considered attempt to bring about peace, provide better security for Israel or respond to the threats posed by BDS,\" she said.\n\n\"It's about using Jews as a pawn in the government's political game.\"\n\nConservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government must remove references to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories from the bill.\n\nShe said the bill \"essentially gives exceptional impunity to Israel\", adding: \"This is something we should not give to any country and I would be standing here making the same request if any country was named.\"\n\nLongstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated \"two-state solution\".\n\nThe UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an \"obstacle to peace\".\n\nThe bill does not stop public bodies from complying with UK-wide sanctions, and it gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions.\n\nFor example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted.\n\nBut the bill does not allow the rules to exempt Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights.\n\nIn doing so, it groups the three territories together, which critics including Labour argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law.\n\nCritics have also raised concerns that the bill would limit campaigns against human rights abuses in other parts of the world - such as against the Uyghur in Xinjiang, China.\n\nAhead of the vote on Monday, the government spokesperson said: \"Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda.\n\n\"The bill will not hinder the robust action we are taking against Uyghur forced labour in supply chains as it contains exceptions to the ban for labour related misconduct, including modern slavery.\n\n\"The ban on boycotts does not apply to individuals, including publicly elected officials, when carrying out private acts that are protected by the Human Rights Act.\"\n\nA Labour amendment to the bill was defeated in the Commons by 272 votes to 212 - a margin of 60.\n\nThe amendment had sought to decline the bill a second reading over concerns it \"risks significantly undermining support\" for groups around the world facing persecution, for example the Uyghur, who are \"currently victims of grave and systemic human rights abuses\".\n\nIt said it opposed any \"discrimination\" by public bodies in how they spend their money and says all public bodies must act \"without bias\" when making decisions on procurement and investment.", "Danielle Watts shows off her new dentures\n\nA woman who extracted her own teeth because she couldn't find an NHS dentist says crowdfunding a new set of dentures has transformed her life. On Tuesday afternoon, MPs will question dental experts from NHS England as part of an official inquiry prompted by a BBC investigation into the dentistry crisis.\n\nOne by one, over several months, Danielle Watts pulled out 13 of her own teeth.\n\nFor years she had been living with terrible pain and discomfort as a result of chronic gum disease, which meant that her teeth - otherwise healthy and unaffected by decay - were becoming loose and falling out.\n\nBut Ms Watts, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, found herself in a \"dental desert\" - an area where no dentists offer NHS care - and couldn't afford the thousands of pounds of private treatment needed to fix her teeth.\n\nDanielle Watts was in constant pain and self-conscious about how she looked and spoke\n\nNow, a crowdfunding campaign has helped raise enough money to let her have a set of dentures fitted - meaning she can smile again.\n\n\"I've got a mouthful of teeth, which feels amazing,\" Ms Watts says. \"I'm not ashamed any more.\"\n\nThe BBC featured her story last year - when our research revealed the extent to which people across the UK were struggling to access NHS dentistry.\n\nThe Covid pandemic had left dental practices with severe backlogs of patients needing appointments, and this exacerbated an NHS funding gap which meant dentists had to take on more private work to survive.\n\nFollowing our investigation, the Health and Social Care Committee launched an inquiry into dentistry, and the cross-party committee has today been hearing evidence from senior NHS England and government figures.\n\nA Government health minister has acknowledged that NHS dentistry in England needs a complete overhaul. Appearing before a committee of MPs, Neil O'Brien said the time for small tweaks to the system had passed, and a much deeper reform was needed.\n\n\"We want to grow the overall level of activity that NHS dentistry is delivering, particularly to do that by making NHS work more attractive in lots of different ways, by fundamentally overhauling the contract that has been there since 2006, which is now pretty badly showing its age,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Health in England says improving NHS access is a priority, and that it has made an extra \u00a350m available \"to help bust the Covid backlogs\" - but tens of thousands of people, like Ms Watts, are still struggling to find an NHS dentist.\n\nLast August, she described how she no longer smiled at people and had stopped going out and socialising.\n\n\"I won't go out and meet new people. I avoid crowded situations. I walk with my head down all the time,\" she told us.\n\nDescribing herself as \"quite a happy, smiley person\", she said she would hang her head to hide her mouth when she laughed in front of people, \"because I know what they're seeing\".\n\nDanielle Watts did not dare to smile in front of people because of her missing teeth\n\nAt the time, Ms Watts's despair was striking.\n\n\"I'm 42 years old and I can't eat and drink. I'm on painkillers every day. I'm not a 90-year-old woman. This shouldn't be happening to me now,\" she said.\n\nNot only was eating increasingly difficult, but her damaged gums were also at risk of infection. In fact, late last year she was hospitalised for three weeks after one such infection got out of control.\n\nBut following our report, a friend persuaded her to set up a crowdfunding page to see if they could raise the money to get her teeth fixed.\n\nIt raised about \u00a32,500, which - along with some funds raised by her mother's church - was enough to get Ms Watts fitted with a set of dentures.\n\nShe says the kindness of strangers has completely transformed her life.\n\n\"I'm in no pain at all, there is no bleeding, my teeth are all facing the same way,\" she says.\n\n\"I don't have to hide anymore. To be able to talk to somebody face-on, to be able to smile at somebody, is something I haven't done for several years.\"\n\nSome people are going to extraordinary measures to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry?\n\nMs Watts knows she is extremely lucky - and that not everyone will be able to benefit from the sort of crowdfunding campaign that helped her.\n\n\"Part of me feels bad because there are so many people who are in my position, but they haven't had that help - so I feel very guilty as well as being incredibly grateful.\"\n\nShe says she feels especially privileged because people donated money during a cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"People still put their hands in their pockets and gave what they could - it's absolutely massive.\"\n\nHave you resorted to DIY dentistry because of a lack of NHS dentists?

This was the principal cause of our outlook,\" the spokesman added.\n\nRoundup was originally launched by US firm Monsanto nearly five decades ago. It became known the world's best-selling weedkiller.\n\nIn 2018, Bayer bought Monsanto in a $63bn deal. The tie-up gave Bayer control of more than a quarter of the global supply of seeds and pesticides.\n\nThe same year, a California court issued the first ruling linking Roundup to cancer and awarded substantial compensation to claimants.\n\nIn the lawsuits, Roundup users blamed the weedkiller and its active ingredient glyphosate for their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other cancers.\n\nIn 2020, Bayer announced a $10.9bn settlement aimed at resolving tens of thousands of lawsuits, while maintaining that glyphosate was safe.\n\nIn March last year, the company said it had resolved 107,000 out of around 138,000 cases involving Roundup.\n\n\"The Roundup settlement is the right action at the right time for Bayer to bring a long period of uncertainty to an end,\" Bayer's chief executive Werner Baumann said in 2020.\n\nHe repeated the company's view that the science indicates: \"Roundup does not cause cancer, and therefore, is not responsible for the illnesses alleged in this litigation\".\n\nGlyphosate is the active ingredient in many weedkillers, although the science about its safety is still far from conclusive.\n\nSome countries have banned herbicides that contain glyphosate, while others continue to allow them.\n\nIn the UK, there is no nationwide ban on glyphosate, although some councils in the country have stopped using it due to safety concerns.\n\nBayer is set to report earnings on 8 August.", "John Caldwell was shot in front of his son in February\n\nA man charged over the New IRA's claim that it shot a top detective joked about the attack on social media, the High Court has heard.\n\nProsecutors claimed Tiarnan McFadden uploaded an image of a ball hitting the back of a net on the night Det Ch Insp John Caldwell was shot in February.\n\nThe post was captioned: \"Anyone fancy a kickabout.\"\n\nThe detective was seriously injured after finishing a youth football coaching session in Omagh.\n\nThe details emerged as 25-year-old Mr McFadden, of Carnhill in Londonderry, and his 23-year-old co-accused Caolan Brogan, from Bluebellhill Gardens in the city, applied for bail.\n\nThey are jointly charged with possessing an article for use in terrorism, namely a typed notice declaring that the New IRA carried out the attack.\n\nThey both deny the charge.\n\nA third man, 37-year-old William McDonnell of Balbane Pass in Derry, is accused of the same offence.\n\nMr Caldwell was shot repeatedly and seriously wounded in front of his young son in the shooting at a sports complex on 22 February.\n\nHe was able to leave hospital in April.\n\nSeven other men are in custody charged with attempting to murder him.\n\nOn 26 February a typed letter claiming the New IRA was responsible for the attack bid appeared on a gable wall in Central Drive in the Creggan estate in Derry.\n\nBased on CCTV and air support footage, the prosecution contended the note was attached about 20 minutes before the message with the image of a ball appeared on the Twitter account \"Republic Media\", the court was told.\n\nMr McFadden and Mr Brogan allegedly travelled together to Mr McDonnell's home, collected a bucket and then headed in the direction of the gable wall.\n\nSeven men have been charged with attempted murder over the shooting\n\nMr McFadden told police he was only at the wall to clean graffiti from a mural.\n\nOpposing bail, the prosecution argued whoever posted the notice must have been trusted by and acting on behalf of the New IRA.\n\nThey claimed that less than two hours after Mr Caldwell was shot, and before details became public, Mr McFadden made reference to the attack online.\n\nMr McFadden also allegedly shared a video of a number of police vans which were believed to be travelling to the scene of the shooting.\n\nThat post included the comment \"What's the rush?\" along with a laughing emoji, the court heard.\n\nWhen someone else online suggested the police were late for their dinner, he allegedly replied: \"Must have missed a football match or something.\"\n\nMr McFadden's barrister argued that the charge was based entirely on circumstantial evidence.\n\nCounsel for Mr Brogan described it as a \"tenuous\" case involving poor-quality CCTV footage, adding that the notice could have been posted as far back as 22 February.\n\nReserving judgment on both defendant's applications for bail, Mr

the former PM and her supporters \"took a wrecking ball to the economy in a disastrous six-week premiership that has left millions facing mortgage misery\".\n\nWendy Chamberlain MP, the Lib Dems' chief whip, described the move as \"truly remarkable\", adding: \"Rishi Sunak must block these honours immediately as allowing Truss to dish out positions of influence shows a stunning lack of humility.\"\n\nThe BBC has not confirmed the names of those reported to be on the list.\n\nMr Littlewood is director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free-market supporting think tank that was

gladioli wherever she went.\n\nOn the journey her creator met with critical disapproval and a battle against alcohol abuse, before becoming what the critic Brian Sewell once described as \"an institution\".\n\nJohn Barry Humphries was born in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell on 17 February 1934. His father was a successful builder and the young Humphries had a comfortable upbringing in a pleasant part of the Australian city.\n\nHe began inventing fictional characters from an early age, spending hours in his parents' back garden dressing up in various costumes.\n\nHe also discovered a gift for entertaining people and once wrote that doing so gave him a great sense of release and helped him find new friends.\n\nHis parents sent him to Melbourne Grammar School, an institution that turned out more than its fair share of notable Australian luminaries, boasting leading politicians, artists, soldiers and sportsmen among its alumni.\n\nHumphries excelled at art and English, and largely ignored the rest of the school curriculum, later writing in Who's Who? that he was \"self-educated\" and attended Melbourne Grammar School.\n\nHe studied law, philosophy and fine arts at Melbourne University and became famous for a series of publicly performed practical jokes influenced by his interest in the Dada movement.\n\nHumphries revelled in the public reactions to his brand of street theatre which illustrated his delight in making his audience feel slightly uncomfortable. It was something that would be a major part of his later career.\n\nAfter leaving university, he joined the Melbourne Theatre Company where he wrote and performed songs and sketches.\n\nDame Edna Everage takes tea on stage with the actress Dame Joan Plowright\n\nIt was in the theatre company's tour bus that, according to his autobiography, Humphries first came up with the idea of a suburban housewife called Mrs Norm Everage, the character making her first stage appearance in a sketch Humphries performed in 1955.\n\nIt was supposed to be a one-off performance but, after Humphries had moved to the Philip Street Revue Theatre in Sydney in 1957, he decided to give Norm, rechristened Edna, another outing and she became something of a hit.\n\nAt the time Humphries used Edna, a dull housewife with decidedly politically incorrect views on foreigners, as a satire on his experience of growing up in the conservative suburbs of Melbourne.\n\nIn 1959, Humphries moved to London where he quickly became part of the new wave of satirical comedy featuring artists such as Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller.\n\nHe also struck up an unlikely, but long lasting friendship with the Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, with whom he shared a passion for both Victoriana and for Cornwall.\n\nIt was in Cornwall in 1962 that his career almost came to a premature end when he fell down a 150 ft cliff near Zennor, breaking a number of bones.\n\nBarry Humphries with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in the 1970s\n\nHumphries created the character, Barry McKenzie, the boorish, sexist, arrogant Australian, who appeared in a comic strip he wrote for the magazine, Private Eye.\n\nThere was much criticism of this character in his home country of Australia which, for a time, banned the sale of a book of the strips. Humphries would receive similar criticism for his character of the lecherous, hard drinking Sir Les Patterson.\n\nHe was happy to return the compliment. \"Australia is an outdoor country,\" he once said. \"People only go inside to use the toilet. And that's a recent development.\"\n\nEdna Everage was not well received by the critics when Humphries first launched her onto the London scene, but he was encouraged by Peter Cook to continue to develop the character.\n\nHis big theatrical break came when he was offered the part of Mr Sowerberry the undertaker in the 1960 stage production of Lionel Bart's stage musical Oliver, and transferred with the show when it was moved to Broadway in 1963.\n\nFour years later, he took the role of Fagin when the show was revived on the London stage.\n\nHe returned to Australia where he toured a series of satirical one man shows featuring Edna Everage and Les Patterson, and the more gentle, and later deceased, Sandy Stone who Humphries described as \"Melbourne talking in its sleep.\"\n\nIn 1973, he co-wrote and appeared in the film, The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, with Barry Crocker playing the title role and Humphries appearing as Aunt Edna. The film also featured a string of stars including Peter Cook, Spike Milligan, Willie Rushton and Joan Bakewell.\n\nSir Les Patterson was as uncouth as Dame Edna was refined\n\nIn the 1974 sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, Edna is created a dame by the then Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.\n\nBut his success came at a price. He had begun to drink heavily during his time in London and on one trip back to Australia, he was found slumped on the side of a street. His parents arranged for him to undergo treatment, following which he gave up alcohol altogether.\n\nDespite his various film and stage appearances, it was in his one man shows that Humphries achieved his greatest following both in the UK and Australia.\n\nAfter a shaky start, he appeared in a series of stage shows including Housewife, Superstar in 1976 and An Evening's Intercourse with Dame Edna in 1982.\n\nOften lasting more than two hours, his performances were masterpieces of original material and improvisation spiced with the barbed insults Edna often aimed at members of her audiences.\n\n\"Tiles only halfway up the wall, darling?\" she would say in discussion with a victim about bathroom decor. \"What went wrong, dear - did you run out of money?\"\n\nHe also became a regular on UK television with The Barry Humphries Show on the BBC and ITV's The Dame Edna Experience.\n\nBy this time the dowdy housewife from Moonee Ponds had turned into a global megastar, flitting between her many luxurious residences across the world and pausing only to advise world leaders and throw armfuls of gladioli to her adoring audiences.\n\nApart from musicians or dancers, Humphries was only ever joined by one other person onstage - the silent Madge, played by English actor Emily Perry, who was Dame Edna's long-suffering best friend and bridesmaid.\n\nOver time Dame Edna's costumes became more extravagant, with her dresses adorned by Australian icons such as kangaroos, koalas and the Sydney Opera House.\n\nIt took the Americans decades to get his particular brand of satirical humour, but Humphries finally achieved success in the US in 1999, when Dame Edna: The Royal Tour opened on Broadway, eventually running for 10 months.\n\nAway from the stage Humphries was passionate about art and literature. A talented artist, he championed the work of many painters, particularly Charles Conder, whose works featured in a BBC documentary which Humphries presented.\n\nHe wrote several plays, books, novels, and autobiographies for which he won a number of awards including the J.R. Ackerley prize for biography in 1993.\n\nBarry Humphries greeting Camilla, the then Duchess of Cornwall, in 2021\n\nIn 2012, he announced he was retiring from live performances and set off on a farewell tour of Australia to huge critical acclaim, one reviewer describing Humphries \"as virile, as vulgar and as magnificent as ever.\" The tour moved on to the UK, before taking America by storm.\n\nA rare sour note came in 2019 when accusations of transphobia led to a major comedy prized named after him being renamed.\n\nIn comments he later said had been misinterpreted, he drew criticism for describing being transgender as \"a fashion\" and also claimed to have been speaking in character with a reference to gender-reassignment surgery as \"self-mutilation\".\n\nControversy aside, the lure of the limelight proved too strong, and in 2022, he emerged from self-imposed exile with The Man in the Mask: a series of shows looking back at his long career.\n\nFast approaching 90, his immaculate comic timing was still as sharp as ever. When he whipped out Dame Edna's famous glasses, there was an enormous cheer.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Barry Humphries held a mirror to Australia and Australians, revealing their virtues and weaknesses through a gallery of adored characters,\n\n\"It's a kind of therapy,\" he once said, \"I'd miss it if I couldn't do it\".\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "This was history in the making - and you had to pinch yourself to think you were seeing it close-up, inside Westminster Abbey.\n\nOver there was the battered but rather beautiful Coronation chair, with a King about to be crowned. It looked almost fragile waiting for its royal occupant.\n\nYou could feel the sense of expectation. It was really happening right here, on an altar full of candlelight, prayers and a glow of gold. The Abbey was like being inside a jewel box.\n\nThe first Coronation in 70 years proved to be a sumptuous, seamless and often surreal ceremony.\n\nBefore 2,300 guests, King Charles and Queen Camilla went through the ancient rituals, with a twist of modern signals about diversity.\n\nBut it was also like a spectacularly lavish wedding, with friends, families and famous faces crowded into every corner of the church, playing with their phones, checking to see who else was there.\n\nAnd where else would international royalty, world leaders and 100 overseas heads of state get an opportunity to meet Ant and Dec?\n\nThe King is crowned in the 700-year-old Coronation chair\n\nThere were glamorous outfits and hats, splashes of military uniforms with epaulettes, plumes and swords, clerical robes and every shade and shape of national dress. The selfies on the way in were going to prove that they'd really been here.\n\nThere were traditional roles with baffling titles such as Bluemantle Pursuivant and Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and a number of men seemed to be entirely dressed in medieval flags.\n\nWalking down the nave when he arrived, the King seemed to be pausing to take it all in.\n\nWhat was he thinking, after all the decades that he'd been waiting for this day? Was he thinking about his mother, his own family, the responsibility?\n\nWhen the Archbishop of Canterbury appeared to give the crown a couple of twists on his head, the King might have been thinking less charitable thoughts.\n\nA guest in the Abbey takes a selfie with Ant and Dec\n\nAnd the only person who could have stolen the King's show was possibly Penny Mordaunt, the lord president of the council, who hovered around the high altar looking like a deity who had escaped from an ancient Greek urn.\n\nBut the King must have been delighted with the music, not least because he'd chosen it himself, like all of this elaborate ceremony. It was like a big work of art and he was its creator.\n\nAt close quarters in the abbey, the orchestra and choir were remarkable, the music welling up like a tidal wave of sound. It was bouncing off the stained glass windows.\n\nThe piece by William Byrd had all the aching melancholy and stillness that you suspect King Charles would really have enjoyed. Handel's Zadok the Priest, full of drama and anticipation, was a real spine-tingler.\n\nThere was also the most eclectic collection of people in the congregation. There were hundreds of charity workers, US First Lady Jill Biden, President Macron and rows of celebrities, such as Joanna Lumley, Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, and hello, it's Lionel Ritchie.\n\nMany of the guests had been inside the abbey for hours before it started, which meant some of the best-dressed queues ever seen for the toilets. I'd never really thought about the mechanics of such a visit for a peer in floor-length robes and ermine.\n\nIt was a lavish and colourful spectacle in the Abbey\n\nThere had been stories about MPs complaining about a lack of tickets for the Coronation. Part of the problem might be there are now so many ex-PMs to accommodate. Even Liz Truss got a seat.\n\nBoris Johnson arrived looking like his shirt collars were staging their own backbench rebellion.\n\nThe current PM, Rishi Sunak, had a speaking part, delivering the Bible lesson.\n\nFor those hoping to watch any body language between Prince Harry and his brother Prince William, there was nothing to see, as they may as well have been sitting a continent apart.\n\nHarry arrived looking relaxed and chatty, despite this being a huge transatlantic flying visit, and was seated a couple of rows behind Prince William, the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrince Harry was heading back to the US straight after the service\n\nThe older brother, who must have been thinking that one day he'll face his own Coronation, was more engaged in his own role in the ceremony.\n\nThere seemed to be glances exchanged too between the husband and wife at the centre of this event, who were maybe having the big public wedding they didn't have before.\n\nKing Charles now has his Queen Camilla beside him. It took them about half an hour to get to the Abbey in the morning, but their journey to this point has taken them decades.\n\nIt's impossible to go into Westminster Abbey without feeling the weight of history on every side. It seeps from every plaque and statue. Even the clothes had a story. The King was wearing a robe that had been his grandfather's and Catherine was wearing earrings that had been Diana's.\n\nMany guests might have been remembering being here at the late Queen's funeral, which eight months ago went out through the same doors as today's newly-crowned couple.\n\nThe King and Queen left the Abbey in the Gold State Coach\n\nSuch grand occasions, snapshots for the history books, are where the past, present and future overlap.\n\nWith the music soaring and the guests on their feet, the King and Queen left the Abbey to step inside the crown-on-wheels that is the Gold State Coach, with umbrellas up against the rain.\n\nThe carriage pulled away, past a sea of waving camera phones, and another era had begun.", "The Iron Shiek squared off against other wrestling greats including Hulk Hogan\n\nThe Iron Sheik, a heavyweight champion WWE wrestler and hall-of-famer, has died aged 81, his family announced.\n\nHe was a \"true legend, a force of nature and an iconic figure who left an incredible mark\" on the wrestling world, they said in a statement on Wednesday. \"It is with great sadness that we share the news.\"\n\nBorn in Iran, the wrestling icon's real name was Hossein Khosrow Ali Vaziri.\n\nHis cause of death has not been given.\n\nAt the peak of his wrestling career, in the 1980s, Vaziri faced off against other greats in the ring including Bob Backlund, Sgt Slaughter and Hulk Hogan.\n\nHe defeated Backlund for the WWF World Heavyweight title in December 1983.\n\nOne month later, in front of an electric crowd of over 20,000 at New York's Madison Square Garden, Hogan took down Vaziri and won the championship belt for the first time.

He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 11 years.\n\nA year later, Hassan Razzaq, the brother of Faisal, was also convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nThat same year, Raza Ul Haq Aslam, was convicted of robbery and jailed for eight years.\n\nHowever, two suspects remained at large. One was Mustaf Jama, who had used a friend's passport to flee to his native Somalia. The other wanted man, Piran Ditta Khan, had escaped to Pakistan.\n\nJama was eventually extradited in 2007 when he was smuggled out of Africa in an undercover operation. The brother of Yusuf Jama, he was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years.\n\nBut it was to be another 17 years before Khan was to face justice for his role as the robbery's instigator.\n\nPiran Ditta Khan fled to Pakistan after PC Beshenivsky's murder in 2005, but was extradited in 2023\n\nBack in 2006, when Mr Brennan was piecing together the investigation, detectives built a picture that showed Khan was the mastermind behind the plot.\n\nKhan had used the travel agents to send money to Pakistan and knew that \"substantial amounts\" of cash would be held at the premises.\n\nLooking back, Mr Brennan says: \"The information we were getting was that he was more important in relation to the organisation of what had taken place than any of the other six individuals.\n\n\"The more information and evidence we got, the clearer his role became of being an instigator.\"\n\nBut by the time police were in a position to arrest him, Khan had already fled to Pakistan - something Mr Brennan says was \"seriously disappointing\".\n\nGetting Khan back to face justice was a long and drawn-out process.\n\nBecause there is no extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan, a diplomatic request was made by the UK for his removal.\n\nMr Brennan said: \"I spent about 12 to 18 months every week going down to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office.\n\n\"I was meeting them on a weekly basis to say, this is the position we're in, these are the individuals we want back.\n\n\"We put pressure on them [the authorities in Pakistan] all the time, but effectively we were in their hands to arrest one of their citizens.\"\n\nUp until January 2020, Khan remained free. However, he was eventually arrested in Pakistan, with his solicitor describing him as a \"scared and shivering man\".\n\nIt then took another three years before Khan was brought back to the UK.\n\nBy the time of Khan's extradition, Mr Brennan had retired from West Yorkshire Police, but recalls being \"elated\" by the development.\n\n\"I knew this was always bubbling away in the background and would never be allowed to go away,\" he says.\n\n\"When I left the case it wasn't complete, but it never left me.\n\n\"So, when I found out he was on his way back to the UK, I was incredibly pleased. I remember having a glass of wine.\"\n\nMr Brennan describes Khan as a \"very dangerous man\" who was \"incredibly greedy\" and \"entirely responsible\" for what had taken place.\n\nThe former officer says: \"He managed to persuade a group to commit this robbery on the pretext that there was a significant amount of money there.\n\n\"But they fled with \u00a35,000 and committed the murder of a police officer on duty.\"\n\nTeresa Milburn, who was also injured, said her colleague PC Beshenivsky did not stand a chance against the gunmen\n\nNow all those responsible for the events of 18 November 2005 have been convicted, Mr Brennan says he believes the bravery of both PC Beshenvisky and PC Milburn should be officially recognised.\n\n\"I know this case inside out and I look back on their actions that day,\" he says.\n\n\"They turned up to a silent alarm taking place - that would usually indicate a robbery or something more serious - and in that knowledge they approached the premises.\n\n\"Both Sharon and Teresa are extremely brave to have done what they did. They could have waited by their cars or could have radioed for armed assistance, but they didn't.\n\n\"I think that was down to the fact they wanted to protect the public and make sure the occupants in the travel agents were safe and well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Brennan says that though Khan's conviction may have been a long time in the making, he was never in any doubt the promise he made to PC Beshenivsky's family would be fulfilled.\n\n\"I made it perfectly clear to Sharon's family, to Teresa and to the public, that we would leave no stone unturned to get justice,\" he says.\n\n\"I had a superb team working with me who gave 110%.\n\n\"So, in my mind, I was confident we would find everyone involved on that horrific day.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Having already won the French Open as a virtually unknown teenager in 2020, she clearly had the potential to take over from Barty but perhaps not the confidence.\n\nHowever, that all changed in a stunning clay-court season last year which formed the bulk of a 37-match winning streak and led to the Pole becoming the dominant force in the women's game.\n\nThis year, she has come under pressure from Belarus' Aryna Sabalenka and Kazakstan's Elena Rybakina - as the trio formed a new 'big three' - leading to doubts over whether Swiatek could dominate Roland Garros again in the same manner.\n\nA thigh injury in the build-up at Rome also led to further questions, but Swiatek quickly dispelled any notion she was no longer the favourite by storming through the draw on the Paris clay.\n\nRybakina's withdrawal early in the tournament through illness ended the prospect of her facing Swiatek in the last four, while Muchova's shock semi-final win over Sabalenka ensured a final few people had predicted.\n\nInstead Swiatek faced the clever Czech, who reached the 2021 Australian Open semi-finals before an array of physical problems derailed her career.\n\nSwiatek started sharply by winning 12 of the first 15 points in the match, holding serve in a 10-minute game to lead 4-1 and facing no more problems as she broke again to clinch the opening set.\n\nAn identical start to the second set - Swiatek again breaking on the way to a 3-0 lead - left those watching wondering if Muchova was also going to be heavily beaten like the Pole's previous final opponents Sofia Kenin and Coco Gauff were.\n\nBut this time Muchova recovered to turn the match into a compelling contest.\n\nSuddenly Swiatek had problems to solve and, with thoughts of a straightforward victory long gone, became animated as she tried to figure out what was going wrong.\n\nThe fact she did was another sure sign of her quality. Regaining her composure, which in turn increased the pressure on Muchova, enabled Swiatek to join Monica Seles and Naomi Osaka as the only women to win their first four major finals in the Open era.\n\n\"I think Swiatek will win double-digit Slams. Will she get to what Serena Williams achieved [23]? I don't think so but this is what the women's game needs,\" said former British number one Greg Rusedski, who was analysing the final for BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"There's so many great players around her. She is a dominant force but they are all getting better. They are forced to because of how good Swiatek is.\"\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\u2022 None A true crime drama weaving together the 1973 investigation with the cold case review\n\u2022 None A chaotic comedy you can't risk to miss:", "Last updated on .From the section European Football\n\nReferees' body PGMOL says it is appalled by the \"unjustified and abhorrent\" abuse directed at Anthony Taylor in Budapest Airport following Wednesday's Europa League final.\n\nThe Englishman had officiated the game, where Sevilla beat Roma on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nTaylor and his family were then shouted at by angry fans at the airport.\n\nBudapest airport officials said an Italian citizen involved in the incident had been charged with affray.\n\nIn the video, which has been shared on social media, Taylor and his family are accosted by fans as they are escorted through the airport. Scuffles then break out as they disappear through a secure door and a chair is thrown.\n\nFollowing the game, Roma manager Jose Mourinho was seen in a car park confronting Taylor with a foul-mouthed rant.\n\nA Budapest Airport statement read: \"Fans of the losing Roma team recognised the referee in the food court of the airport, where he was waiting for his flight to depart.\n\n\"Thanks to the airport operator's close co-operation with the police and the increased police presence at the airport during the arrival and departure of the fans, the authorities intervened immediately, and the referee was escorted to a lounge and boarded his flight safely, accompanied by police officers.\n\n\"The Italian citizen involved in the incident was apprehended by the police and criminal proceedings have been initiated on charges of affray.\"\n\nPGMOL said in a statement: \"[We are] aware of videos circulating on social media showing Anthony Taylor and his family being harassed and abused at Budapest Airport.\n\n\"We are appalled at the unjustified and abhorrent abuse directed at Anthony and his family as he tries to make his way home from refereeing the Uefa Europa League final.\n\n\"We will continue to provide our full support to Anthony and his family.\"\n\nThe Premier League said it was \"shocked and appalled by the unacceptable abuse\" directed at Taylor and his family.\n\nA Premier League spokesperson added: \"No-one should have to suffer the inexcusable behaviour they had to endure.\n\n\"Anthony is one of our most experienced and accomplished match officials and we fully support him and his family.\"\n\nWest Ham manager David Moyes, whose side play Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final on Wednesday, said: \"All referees have a really difficult job and shouldn't be put through any difficult situations. That's not correct.\"\n\nUefa is waiting for reports from match officials and delegates before deciding whether to take action against Mourinho over the incident in the car park under the stadium after the match.\n\nMourinho criticised Taylor in his news conference and he was later captured ranting and making pointed comments as Taylor and officials were boarding a minibus.\n\nThe Portuguese repeatedly swore and twice shouted about a \"disgrace\" before talking in Italian.\n\nUefa's chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti attempted to calm the situation down.\n\nMourinho was booked during an ill-tempered game, with Taylor repeatedly called to the benches to take action as fourth official Michael Oliver struggled to keep control.\n\nTaylor issued yellow cards to 13 players, the most bookings in a Europa League game. Seven of them were to Roma players, a record for a final.\n\nDelays and injuries saw more than 25 minutes of injury time played across the four halves of the game, which went to extra time and then a shootout.\n\n'Mourinho should be banned for 10 games'\n\nFormer Premier League referee Keith Hackett called on Uefa to give Mourinho a 10-game ban and take tougher action against clubs.\n\n\"What is appalling here is that a referee has gone out and done his job,\" Hackett told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It is a prestigious game for him - for an English referee to be appointed to the final.\n\n\"He was looking forward to that. He spent years of refereeing to get to the level he is at. He is a world-class referee. He delivers a very difficult game without much contention and then he is faced with this particular problem as he is in the airport.\n\n\"It is unprecedented and Uefa have got to take action.\n\n\"The sanction for Mourinho? They have got to come down with a 10-game ban.\n\n\"They have also got to ban the teams from Europe.

Kyiv responded by saying it followed international law while defending itself.\n\nThe organisation has previously accused Russia of using similar devices across Ukraine during its full-scale invasion.\n\nAccording to the World Bank - which provides low interest loans to countries who need cash - de-mining Ukraine is going to cost $37.4bn (\u00a330bn).\n\nKyiv is trying to convince as many countries as possible to help so, in its words, \"it doesn't take decades\".\n\nGiven how it's spent the last 70 years clearing mines from World War Two, it's an approach which will require optimism.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Michael Gove says the Ukraine war and Covid pandemic made the UK poorer\n\nThe UK is poorer than it would have been, partly due to the war in Ukraine, but also the pandemic, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has admitted.\n\nBut he said ministers were taking action on the soaring cost of living, including giving help on energy bills.\n\nThe head of the independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said living standards were seeing their biggest squeeze on record.\n\nRichard Hughes said Brexit had been similar to the pandemic in its impact.\n\n\"It's a shock to the UK economy of the order of magnitude to other shocks that we've seen from the pandemic, from the energy crisis,\" he told the BBC.\n\nPoor productivity had also hurt growth, he said.\n\nAnd he warned living standards would not return to pre-pandemic levels for another five to six years.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with the OBR's assessments, Mr Gove said economic forecasting was \"a very difficult exercise\". He added that the UK was dealing with \"the aftershocks of two significant events\".\n\n\"[There's] both the war in Ukraine, the first time we've had war on this scale on the continent in Europe since the Second World War, and the Covid pandemic, the biggest global health pandemic since the end of the First World War,\" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\n\"They have had a huge effect on our economy and on others' economies.\"\n\nMr Gove denied that the government was to blame after 13 years in power, but added: \"One can always do better, yes.\"\n\nHowever, he insisted ministers were taking action to address soaring inflation - the rate at which prices rise - by taxing oil and gas firms' profits and lowering household energy bills.\n\nHe also said the Budget had taken steps to help people back to work and to help families, including with childcare.\n\nThe OBR forecasts that inflation will fall below 3% this year - down from 10.4% currently - as food and energy prices rise less quickly.\n\nBut speaking on the same programme, OBR chairman Richard Hughes said the outlook was volatile given Britain was a net importer of food and energy - the prices of which were set in global markets.\n\nMr Hughes added that the longer term outlook for the economy was bleak, with people's real spending power - allowing for inflation - not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade.\n\nMr Hughes blamed a range of issues for holding back the economy, saying: \"We've lost around 500,000 people from the labour force, we've seen stagnant investment since 2016 and also our productivity has slowed dramatically since the financial crisis and not really recovered.\"\n\nHe also said that overall output was forecast to be 4% lower than it would have been as a result of leaving the EU.\n\nLast week the Bank of England put up interest rates for the 11th time since December 2021 as it continued its battle to ease inflation.\n\nThe decision to lift rates to 4.25% from 4% came after the inflation rate rose unexpectedly last month to 10.4%.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Watch: Spanish police gave the BBC's Nick Beake access to the \"narco-sub\"\n\nI'm about to climb into the first \"narco-sub\" known to have brought cocaine from South America to Europe.\n\nIt's 20 metres (65 ft) long, built out of fibreglass and - remarkably - homemade.\n\nAfter clambering on top, I lift up the wonky manhole cover and descend into the hull where three men survived for 27 long days and nights, as they voyaged across the Atlantic Ocean just under the surface of the crashing waves.\n\nThe sunlight tries to creep in from faint cracks in the walls. There is a steering wheel, a couple of basic dials and a rusted key still wedged in the ignition.\n\nYou can understand why one prospective skipper took one look at the vessel and concluded it was a death trap.\n\nThree men and $150m worth of cocaine crossed the Atlantic in the tiny submersible\n\nThe heat and noise would have been intense as the engine in the back of the sub burned through the 20,000 litres of fuel stored onboard.\n\nThe crew of two Ecuadorean cousins and a former Spanish boxer set out from the Brazilian rainforest and first travelled along the Amazon river.\n\nThey had energy bars, cans of sardines and plastic bags they used for toilet facilities.\n\nThat was about all they had. Apart, of course, from three tonnes of cocaine worth more than $150m (\u00a3121m).\n\nBut this was not a lucrative, covert mission neatly accomplished.\n\nThe sub's journey in late 2019 had been tracked by law enforcement agencies, including the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA).\n\nAfter scuttling their vessel near the coast of Galicia, having run into problems, the men were arrested and jailed.\n\nThe homemade submarine now sits in a car park in central Spain\n\nThis piece of history in the fight against international drug trafficking is now a trophy in the car park of the Spanish police academy in \u00c1vila.\n\nHowever, it's not a rotting relic of a bygone battle: it's a symbol of a secretly growing phenomenon.\n\nJust last month, another sub was discovered off the Spanish coast - again in the Galicia region.\n\n\"For more than 20 years traffickers have been using submarines to reach Africa and Europe, but these two are the first we've seized,\" explains Antonio Martinez Duarte, Chief Commissioner of the Narco Brigade in the Spanish National Police.\n\n\"They are very hard to detect,\" he admits.\n\nFor more than 20 years traffickers have been using submarines... They are very hard to detect\n\nIn fact, it's thought hundreds of homemade submarines have been launched towards Europe, which is the biggest cocaine market after the US, and one that's growing rapidly after a Covid pandemic slump.\n\nIt's even said that in the middle of the Atlantic, around the Canary Islands and the Azores, there lies a mass graveyard of cocaine submarines, deliberately sunk after their cargo had been successfully unloaded.\n\nEach covert mission would have been a huge triumph for the teams of mechanics quietly constructing their vessels in the depths of the South American jungle, mostly in Guyana and Suriname.\n\nHere though, in Spain today, as part of the global trafficking war, it's the police trumpeting a big victory at their headquarters in Madrid.\n\n\"This is a very important operation,\" says Chief Commissioner Duarte. \"It's the first time in Europe that we found as much as one and a half tonnes of base cocaine paste.\"\n\nIn fact, officers say it was the biggest lab turning raw coca paste into cocaine that they've found on the continent. But it's not just the size of the haul which is significant.\n\n\"This operation also confirms the links between Colombian and Mexican criminals that have joined Spanish gangs working in Spain,\" Chief Commissioner Duarte says.\n\nClearly proud of their work, the police have transported the contents of the lab into a press conference room to show local journalists.\n\nThe stench of the raw coca paste - like that of vinegar - hangs in the air.\n\nThe drugs-making process has been replicated, with barrels of chemicals, a microwave, a hydraulic press and scales - reflecting the journey from paste to final product.\n\nOn a table at the far end of the room are dozens of brown parcels, each the size of a house brick, emblazoned with a Superman logo - the symbol chosen by the traffickers who no doubt felt a sense of invincibility.\n\nThe bricks of cocaine were stamped with the Superman logo\n\nAn officer leans over and whispers that importers pay \u20ac27-32,000 ($30-35,000; \u00a324-28,000) for each parcel. They then at least double their money when they sell it on the streets.\n\nThe only limit on their profits is to what extent they dilute their drug with cutting agents, ranging from anaesthesia (which mimic physical sensations associated with cocaine, such as numbing of the mouth) to cheaper options like caffeine and glucose.

Clearly the penalty is not deserved. It is too severe.\"\n\nAlpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon were the other big losers from the official decisions - they took the penultimate restart fifth and 10th but crashed into each other and retired at the second corner.\n\nThe unprecedented events will lead to controversy that F1 is putting showbusiness before sport.\n\nThere is a direct line from the final laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2021 - when officials made errors that changed the course of the world championship fight between Verstappen and Hamilton - to these events, as the final two red flags were thrown to try to ensure the grand prix would finish under racing conditions.\n\nIronically, that desire led to the final, bizarre and confusing climax, and a race that instead ended under a safety car.\n\nThe first-corner crash led the FIA to make a decision that a lap had taken place but that most of the events during it had had no effect, other than the crash between the Alpines.\n\nVerstappen's win, coupled with a fifth place for his team-mate Sergio Perez after the Mexican started from the back, extended the Dutchman's championship lead to 15 points.\n\u2022 None One lap, six questions - take our Australian GP quiz\n\nA race which began with Russell overtaking Verstappen off the line turned to despair with a power unit failure\n\nThe extraordinary events at the end of a race that had already had two safety cars and a previous red flag were triggered when Kevin Magnussen's Haas ran wide at the first chicane and tagged the wall.\n\nThe impact broke the Dane's wheel rim, caused a puncture and left debris strewn across the track.\n\nThe timing of the incident meant that, according to the rules, there would be two racing laps after the restart.\n\nSainz tagged Alonso's rear wheel and tipped the Aston Martin into a spin, triggering chaos behind.\n\nPerez ran wide across the grass and then Gasly, appearing not to see Ocon on his outside, pushed his team-mate into the wall, taking both cars out.\n\nThe red flag was immediately thrown again and the rules dictated the order had to be that at the restart because the field had not covered enough ground for there to be any other reference to set the start order.\n\nThat reinstated Alonso to third, despite him being dropping to the back after his collision, and Perez to fifth, after losing a lot of ground.\n\nThe Aston Martin of Lance Stroll was fourth, followed by Perez, McLaren's Lando Norris and Haas driver Nico Hulkenberg. McLaren's Oscar Piastri, Alfa Romeo's Zhou Guanyu and Alpha Tauri's Yuki Tsunoda completed the points positions.\n\nWhat happened before the controversy?\n\nBefore the final climax, Verstappen had dispensed with an early challenge from Mercedes' George Russell and Hamilton to dominate the race.\n\nAn incident-packed start to the grand prix featured two safety-car periods - the first on the opening lap and the second on lap six - and a first red flag.\n\nThe first safety car was caused by a crash between Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Stroll at Turn Three on lap one, the second by a heavy crash by Alex Albon's Williams at Turn Six.\n\nLeclerc, disappointed by a third consecutive difficult race, described it as \"the worst start to a season ever\".\n\nVerstappen, who had made a bad start and dropped behind the Mercedes cars, ran third for a while but once in front was in total control.\n\nRussell was taken out of contention for the lead by a pit stop hoping to benefit from the safety car for Albon's crash, only to see the race stopped for the first time soon after. He described the decision to stop the race at that point as \"totally unnecessary\".\n\nVerstappen passed Hamilton two laps after the restart for his second win of the year.\n\nRussell retired from fourth place a few laps after the restart with an engine failure - a weekend that had started with a superb second place on the grid ending in frustration.\n\nSainz benefited, promoted to fourth place by Russell's problem and slowly pushing up to challenge Hamilton and Alonso but unable to pass them.\n\nGasly went with the Ferrari and was on course to take fifth in an impressive performance for the French team before the late drama.\n\nVerstappen rarely needed to use his pace, but the advantage the Red Bull has over the rest of the field was clear as he homed in on Hamilton to take the lead after the restart.\n\nThe Dutchman made his second poor start of the weekend. He lost places to both Mercedes at the first start, and was challenged by third-placed Alonso at the second, but once up and running was in a class of his own.\n\nWithin two laps of the restart, the Red Bull was right with Hamilton, and Verstappen blasted past the Mercedes on the straight up to the fast Turn Nine/10 chicane, displaying the huge advantage the Red Bull has on the straights with the DRS overtaking aid open.\n\nThere were just four corners left before the end of the lap, but through them Verstappen pulled out a two-second advantage before beginning to manage his pace, edging ever further ahead without ever extending a car that has a reliability vulnerability in the gearbox/driveshaft area.\n\nHis only problem was when he ran wide at the penultimate corner on lap 47, with 11 to go, after which he complained that he kept locking his front wheel into that corner.\n\nIt cut his lead from 11 seconds to seven, but Verstappen was able to continue untroubled thereafter.\n\nWhile Verstappen circulated serenely up front, Hamilton was left to try to hold off a determined challenge from Alonso.\n\nHamilton constantly radioed his concern back to the pits that his tyres would not make the distance, as the gap to his old rival oscillated between a second and two.\n\nHe was warned by his race engineer Peter Bonnington that Alonso was trying to trick him into over-using his tyres, and \"not to fall for it\".\n\nAnd as so many times in the past, he was able to manage his tyres with expertise as Alonso did the same and the two circulated close together to the flag.\n\nFollowing Russell's retirement, Sainz closed in on Alonso, but he, too, was unable to get the gap down to under 1.5secs. And in the final 10 laps or so and he began to drop back.\n\nAnd Gasly drove an excellent race to stay within the second margin that ensured he could use the advantage provided by the DRS overtaking aid to track the Ferrari to the flag, a promising sign for Alpine.\n\u2022 None It's sink or swim for rookie police officers in Belfast:\n\u2022 None Four movies that predicted the future wrong: Are practical hoverboards and flying cars just a distant dream?", "Many people have been left waiting to speak to a GP surgery receptionist for up to an hour, a patients' watchdog says\n\nPeople in parts of Wales are facing a \"crisis of access\" to GPs, according to a patients' watchdog.\n\nThe Community Health Council (CHC) said many were left waiting for up to an hour on the phone to speak to someone.\n\nWhen they finally get through, they are often told there are no available appointments, it added.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said doctors were trying to ease the problem by using modern technology such as video calling.\n\nBut the union admitted an ongoing problem had been made worse by the pandemic.\n\nOne health board estimated demand for appointments was up 20% in some places.\n\nGeoff Ryall-Harvey, of the North Wales CHC, said he feared people were getting \"extremely frustrated\".\n\nSome surgeries, he said, had banned queueing outside because of Covid.\n\nBut with some GPs not having an online booking system, he said this had meant long waits on the phone for some.\n\nBecca Martin tried to get an appointment for her father when he developed a urine infection in June\n\nMr Ryall-Harvey said: \"People are being told all the appointments are gone, even at 08:10 in the morning when the lines have just opened.\n\n\"It's one thing to be told that there are no appointments left, but for this to happen several days on the run means there's a very real crisis of access for people in some areas.\n\n\"Part of the problem goes back before the Covid pandemic.

She announced last month that she would be standing down once a replacement was appointed.\n\nMr Yousaf was backed by all 64 SNP MSPs and the seven Greens, with the two parties having a power-sharing agreement in the 129-seat parliament.\n\nMr Yousaf was congratulated by Shona Robison, who will become his deputy first minister\n\nAll 31 Conservative MSPs voted for Douglas Ross, the 22 Labour members for Anas Sarwar and the four Liberal Democrats backed Alex Cole-Hamilton.\n\nMr Yousaf said it was a signal of the progress that Scotland has made that two of the nominees for first minister - himself and Mr Sarwar, who were at school together at the private Hutchesons' Grammar in Glasgow - were from minority ethnic communities.\n\nHe described the moment as \"a privilege of my life\", and said Ms Sturgeon - who watched the vote from the backbenches - leaves \"some very big shoes to fill indeed\".\n\nMr Yousaf added: \"I pledge that Scotland will continue to be a positive, progressive voice on the world stage\".\n\nAnd he said his government would \"listen carefully and pay respect\" to the views of all MSPs while standing up to any attempts to \"undermine devolution\".\n\nNicola Sturgeon now sits on the back benches at Holyrood\n\nThe new first minister said: \"I will never shy away from tackling the big issues our country faces.\n\n\"My starting point will be that we all want the best for Scotland and the people that we are so privileged to represent. I will stand up unequivocally for this parliament and against any attempts to undermine devolution.\n\n\"I will work every hour of every day to harness the potential of Scotland and every single person. I will place no limits on the ambitions that we have collectively for ourselves, for our country or indeed for the world that we live in.\"\n\nMr Yousaf will be officially sworn in as first minister during a brief ceremony at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Wednesday, and is expected to then start the process of appointing the rest of his cabinet team.\n\nHe will also face opposition leaders for the first time at the weekly First Minister's Questions session on Thursday.\n\nThere will be considerable interest in the future of Kate Forbes, who finished a close second to Mr Yousaf in the SNP leadership contest after attacking his competency and Ms Sturgeon's record in government in a live STV debate during the campaign.\n\nMs Forbes had herself been attacked by senior SNP figures including outgoing Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who has also now left the government, over her socially conservative views on issues like gay marriage and abortion.\n\nShe has been on maternity leave as the country's finance secretary and Mr Yousaf has said he has spoken to her and \"absolutely\" wants her to be part of the government - but it not yet known what role he would offer or whether she would accept.\n\nHumza Yousaf's speech was really an introduction to himself as first minister. Unlike the other party leaders, there was relatively little in the way of politics.\n\nHe leaned heavily on his family, who were packed into the VIP gallery. His children were warned that Bute House's stairways offer plenty of space for a \"naughty step\".\n\nAnd he talked about the impact of being a Muslim in the UK in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n\nMr Yousaf hopes it sends a message to many in minority groups that he could go from fearing he did not have a place in Scotland to leading its government.\n\nThere was some broad-brush policy towards the end - a commitment to ease cost of living pressures and boost the NHS. He pledged to continue many of Nicola Sturgeon's plans, and sounded the obvious note in favour of independence.\n\nBut this was very much Day One of the Yousaf government. There will be plenty of time to come for detail and debate - today was all about beginnings.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was looking forward to meeting and working together with Mr Yousaf, but the UK government has already made clear it will continue to refuse to grant formal consent for another independence referendum.\n\nMr Yousaf was also congratulated on his appointment by opposition leaders at Holyrood, with Mr Ross saying: \"With both the first minister and the prime minister representing the UK's diverse communities, this sends a strong, positive message to everyone that there are no barriers to what you can achieve in this country.\"\n\nBut he went on to claim that Mr Yousaf \"seems to be doing his best to offer a poor imitation of his predecessor\" having decided on his first day to \"renew Nicola Sturgeon's constitutional conflict with the UK government\" by calling on it to grant formal consent for an independence referendum.\n\nMr Sarwar told Mr Yousaf that their respective grandparents \"could never have imagined\" that their grandchildren would reach the positions of first minister and Scottish Labour leader when they arrived in the country and made Scotland their home.\n\nHe added: \"I know that he (Mr Yousaf) has faced personal abuse and racism, as have so many others who don't have the platform that he and I are fortunate to have.\n\n\"I am proud of the work we have done alongside others to stand against hatred and bigotry, and my promise is that I will continue to stand alongside you in that fight for all of us.\"", "The woman was riding along Alfreton Road when she fell off her mobility scooter\n\nOfficers are investigating after a woman in her 60s fell off her mobility scooter and died.\n\nShe was riding along Alfreton Road, in Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, shortly before 11:00 BST on Friday when she fell into the road.\n\nOfficers said she fell off near the junction with Willowbridge Lane and suffered a head injury.\n\nPolice said: \"We are currently working to understand what happened so we can give her family the answers they need.\"\n\nThe woman was taken to hospital with a head injury but sadly died later in the day.\n\nDet Con Adam Rigby said: \"We are asking any witnesses who have not yet spoken to us to come forward with information, and are particularly keen to speak with anyone who may have recorded dashcam footage at or near the scene.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Unbeaten with the bat and with a bowling day still to come, Broad said after the fifth Ashes Test there will be no more.\n\nThere will be one last crack at the Australians, one more chance to knock over David Warner, one final match to win. He might even club some runs. There will not be a dry eye in the house.\n\nHow fitting that one of the finest Ashes competitors of them all, the boy who grew up watching replays of his father Chris downing the Aussies, will go out toe to toe against the oldest enemy, with the lights on brightest and the stakes at their highest.\n\u2022 None The premature baby who became a legend - Broad by those who know him best\n\u2022 None Quiz: How many of Broad's Test wickets can you name?\n\n\"Something inside of me wanted to finish playing at the top level,\" said Broad. \"England against Australia at The Oval in one of the most entertaining, fun Ashes I can remember seems an appropriate time.\n\n\"The competitiveness of what Australia bring to cricket brings out the best in me. I love that eye-to-eye battle, I love the energy the crowd brings.\n\n\"I know my emotions have to be sky high to be a good bowler. I can promise you every single time I've run in with a ball in my hand against Australia, they've been there.\"\n\nBroad made his decision to call time less than 24 hours before he told the world. He went to see England captain Ben Stokes and broke the news.\n\nHis old mate and long-time new-ball partner James Anderson thought he was joking. Broad choked up when he told Joe Root, then passed on responsibility for organising the team kickabout in the warm-up to Ben Duckett.\n\nOn Saturday at The Oval, England were batting with the knowledge that Broad was bowing out. When he walked to the middle, Mark Wood was waiting and joked with Broad it was a \"great honour\". How apt that Broad ended the day walking off with Anderson.\n\nThe bare facts tell a tale of a great career. Some 602 Test wickets and counting, fifth on the all-time list and second only to Anderson in terms of pace bowlers. One of just two men, alongside Shane Warne, to take more than 500 Test wickets and score in excess of 3,000 runs. The only man to take two Test hat-tricks for England. Four Ashes series wins.\n\nBut Broad is a cricketer of more than mere numbers.\n\nPerhaps no England player has connected with and fed off a crowd like Broad. Few have thrived on the heat of battle quite as much as the Nottinghamshire man. Fewer still have the ability to turn themselves into an unstoppable force, with a Broad 'spell' as thrilling as it is irresistible.\n\nThe Oval in 2009, Chester-le-Street in 2013 and, most famously, Trent Bridge in 2015 are Broad's Ashes highlights, but South Africa at the Wanderers in 2016, India in Nottingham in 2011 and New Zealand at Lord's in 2013 were just as spectacular.\n\nNo England bowler has taken more six-wicket hauls than Broad's 12 in Test cricket. When the knees were pumping, we all knew.\n\nBroad was the premature baby, born 12 weeks early and weighing 2lb 2oz, who grew up to become an England giant. He was the teenager that went off to play club cricket in Australia as a batter and came back on course to become one of the greatest fast bowlers the game has ever seen.\n\u2022 None 'The premature baby who became an England legend'\n\nNot that the upward trajectory was always smooth. Three months before his Test debut, Broad was infamously whacked for six sixes in a single over by India's Yuvraj Singh in the first T20 World Cup in South Africa. Some 21-year-olds might not have recovered.\n\nIn the early stages of Broad's Test career, there was a theory that his height would make him suited as a bang-it-in enforcer, not a top-of-off hunter like his hero Glenn McGrath. It took until the 74th match of a 167-Test career for Broad's bowling average to dip below 30.\n\nHe had a three-year spell as England's T20 captain that resulted in more losses than wins, most notably a humbling by the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup in Bangladesh. It was the last T20 international he ever played and he was part of only two more one-dayers for England after the horrible early exit at the 2015 World Cup. The end of the white-ball involvement allowed the Test career to extend to a point where only Sachin Tendulkar, Anderson, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh have played more matches.\n\nThere are times when he has been written off. Dropped for the first Test against West Indies in 2020, when England were in the Southampton 'bio-bubble', Broad famously went in front of the Sky cameras and said he was \"frustrated, angry and gutted\".\n\nTwo years later, with England playing the Windies once more and Andrew Strauss pressing the button on a 'red-ball reset', Broad was left out again, fearing it was the end of his career. In the period since he was recalled, no fast bowler in the world has taken more than Broad's 65 Test scalps.\n\nIf Broad the bowler is so hard to replace, Broad the character will never be matched.\n\nThis is the man who was vilified in Australia after not walking in the 2013 Trent Bridge Ashes Test, then fell out with a robot at Hobart in 2022.\n\nHe has the outrageous facial expressions and the celebrappeals. He is the Nighthawk and the man who, in his own words, picked a fight with every Australian when he arrived at the crease as the next man in after the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow at Lord's earlier this summer.\n\nJust last week, when Marnus Labuschagne was complaining of a reflection from the direction of the Old Trafford pavilion, it was Broad who went to speak to the spectators sitting in front of the sightscreen and persuaded them all to change seats.\n\nEven in this Test, with England low on luck, Broad dipped behind Labuschagne and switched the bails. Next ball, Labuschagne nicked off.\n\nFor Broad, the timing of the exit might be bittersweet, given he has finally emerged from the shadow of Anderson as England's attack leader.\n\nIn this Ashes, it is Anderson who has bowled without success and had to fend off questions about his future, while Broad, at 37, has played in every Test and emerged as England's leading wicket-taker. It is a quirk of their great partnership that Broad actually has a better average and strike-rate in matches when he has not played with Anderson.\n\nBroad's departure is the first domino in an impending regeneration of an England Test team that currently has eight players over the age of 32.\n\nFor Stokes, revolutionising the way England play is one achievement, presiding over the arrival of a new team is a different proposition.\n\nWhoever arrives, Stokes is unlikely to find a fighter like Broad.\n\n\"When I was a kid growing up, I had sporting idols like Martin Johnson and Stuart Pearce,\" said Broad. \"When I watched them, I loved their passion and drive. I never looked at them and thought 'I could give more for that shirt'.\n\n\"I have never wanted anyone in the crowd or watching at home or listening on the radio to think 'he's not putting in, he's not giving absolutely everything'.\n\n\"I know I am not the most skilful player that's played. I know I need every inch of my competitive spirit and my drive and my effort to get anything out of my ability.\n\n\"I've given my heart and soul. I can't think there'll be too many cricket fans out there who would think I've slacked off for a moment.\"\n\nWhat a competitor. What a cricketer. What a bowler.", "Officials from the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada board the Polar Prince after it arrived back in St. John's\n\nInvestigators in Canada have boarded the support ship used to launch the Titan submersible in their bid to understand what caused the vessel's catastrophic implosion.\n\nFlags on board the Polar Prince were at half-mast as it docked in St John's, Newfoundland, on Saturday.\n\nAnother boat was seen in the harbour towing the Titan's launch platform.\n\nThe Titan was on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic when it broke apart, killing all five people on board.\n\nLocals in St John's gathered around the cannon on top of Battery Lookout at 08:00 (11:30 BST) to watch the Polar Prince return to port.

Whole communities would be exposed to life-threatening toxins. Highly polluted air would affect millions,\" it said.\n\nThe organisation added that a potential oil spill could cost up to $20bn (\u00a316.7bn) to clean up.\n\nThe UN had been searching for years for a solution and appealed for donations. The planned operation is estimated to cost $129m of which $75m has been received and another $20m has been pledged, it said.\n\nThe stranded ship - the FSO Safer - was left abandoned off the port of Hodeida after Yemen's civil war broke out in 2015. It has not been serviced since.\n\nIt was constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and converted later into a floating storage for oil. It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.\n\nThe 376m (1,233ft) vessel holds an estimated 1.14m barrels of crude oil.\n\nThe Safer's structural integrity has deteriorated significantly since maintenance operations were suspended in 2015, when the Houthis seized large parts of Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of the government. The ensuing conflict has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left more than 23 million in need of aid.\n\nMr Steiner told reporters on Thursday: \"Let me be very clear - this is a risky operation and things could go wrong.\" He added that it could still be suspended if they fail to raise enough funds.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It also said the brothers were probably helped by an unknown source in Libya.\n\nDuring the early weeks of the police investigation, over 20 people were arrested.\n\nA key feature of the case soon emerged: the Abedi brothers had asked several friends and relatives to buy chemicals used to make the bomb.\n\nMr Soliman, who worked in a takeaway with Hashem Abedi, was among them.\n\nTen litres of sulphuric acid were purchased using his own bank details and Amazon account in March 2017.\n\nThe chemical was delivered to Mr Soliman's home and officers raided the property after the attack.\n\nTwenty-two people died in the bombing on 22 May 2017\n\nAll those questioned about buying chemicals denied knowing of the bomb plot and said Hashem Abedi had claimed he needed help purchasing the products for legitimate reasons. None were charged in relation to the attack and some became prosecution witnesses at Hashem Abedi's trial.\n\nHowever, Mr Soliman was not in the UK or about to come back, so was not questioned by police and did not provide his version of events.\n\nHe had flown out of Manchester in April that year, eventually making his way to stay with family in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nIn July 2017, the home secretary Amber Rudd removed his citizenship. As is typical in such cases, she was acting on advice from MI5.\n\nHe was arrested by Libyan law enforcement the same month.\n\nMr Soliman appealed against the removal of his citizenship at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).\n\nThe government justified its actions by saying he was an associate of Salman Abedi, might have known about the bombing beforehand, and might have helped in its preparation.\n\nSIAC is a semi-secret court and many of its hearings and rulings are never made public, because they include sensitive evidence which the government says it cannot divulge.\n\nMr Soliman's case took place entirely in secret.\n\nIt ended in July 2021 without going to a full hearing. The then home secretary Priti Patel \"decided to withdraw the decision\" to deprive Mr Soliman of his British citizenship, according to the formal document which confirmed the move.\n\nIn doing so, she was also acting on advice from MI5, but their advice had changed - without Mr Soliman ever being questioned by British police.\n\nAs part of the appeal, Mr Soliman claimed he had been subjected to \"detention and ill treatment\" abroad after his citizenship was removed.\n\nThe BBC has been told his arrest in Libya was ultimately because of information from the UK.\n\nHe was not publicly named in the UK in connection to the case until Hashem Abedi's trial. His arrest in Libya, therefore, could not have been based on information in the public domain.\n\nIt is a controversial issue because British police have not made formal requests for suspects in the arena case to be arrested and questioned in Libya, partly owing to the potential for allegations of torture and British complicity in it.\n\nHashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the arena attack, after his brother had been named as the bomber. British authorities have denied requesting his arrest. He was transferred to the UK in 2019, and later claimed he had been tortured during questioning in Libya.\n\nHis lawyers included these claims in an unsuccessful attempt at halting his trial in 2020.\n\nThe families of two victims told the BBC how police said that, if Mohammed Soliman was in the UK, he would have been tried alongside Hashem Abedi.\n\nCaroline Curry from South Shields, whose 19-year-old son Liam was killed, said that at the time of the trial a senior detective had claimed Mr Soliman \"would have been alongside him charged with 22 counts of murder\".\n\nLiam died alongside girlfriend Chloe Rutherford, 17, whose family say they were told the same thing.\n\nBoth families think detectives believed he would not return and the claims would not be tested. In fact, a charging decision had never been taken.\n\nAfter Mr Soliman's citizenship was restored, he returned to Britain in October 2021 and was arrested on arrival.\n\nHe answered detectives' questions and denied knowing anything about the bomb plot.\n\nIn a witness statement, Mr Soliman said Hashem Abedi had pressured him to let him use his bank card, saying he needed it to buy car engine oil.\n\n\"I was not aware and did not suspect that Hashem and/or Salman planned to attack any location or person or carry out any form of terrorist attack,\" his statement said.\n\nMr Soliman also said his flight from Manchester had been planned before Hashem purchased the sulphuric acid, and he was eventually going to Libya, where he was due to enrol at university.\n\nHe was told by the police he would not be charged with any offence and would face no further action.\n\nThe BBC attempted to contact Mr Soliman for comment but has received no response.\n\nThe Home Office said: \"The government, working with our world-class police and security and intelligence agencies, will always take strongest action possible to protect national security and public safety.\"\n\nDo you have information about this story?

That challenge has been exacerbated by decisions that had to be taken last year and which cannot be repeated.\n\n\"I have had to make difficult decisions to ensure DfI and its delivery partners (DVA, Translink, NI Water, and Waterways Ireland) do everything possible to reduce spending and balance their budgets, while at the same time meeting responsibilities to deliver multiple statutory functions and keep people safe.\"\n\nA Northern Ireland Office spokesman said this year's budget allocation from the government had given the department an allocation of \u00a3523m, an increase of \u00a32m above the 2022-23 budget.\n\n\"The decisions required to live within this budget continue to rest with the Northern Ireland departments,\" he said.\n\n\"We are clear that we hope NI parties will restore locally elected, accountable and effective devolved government as soon as possible, which is the best way to govern Northern Ireland,\" he added.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is \"fine\" after tripping and falling over at an event in Colorado, White House officials say.\n\nHe stumbled on a sandbag while handing out diplomas at a graduation ceremony for the US Air Force Academy.\n\nMr Biden, who is the nation's oldest serving president at 80, was helped back onto his feet and appeared to be unhurt after Thursday's fall.\n\n\"I got sandbagged!\" the president joked to reporters as he arrived back at the White House that evening.\n\nHe had been standing for about an hour and a half to shake hands with each of the 921 graduating cadets.\n\nFootage shows Mr Biden appearing to point at one of two sandbags used to prop up his teleprompter as he was helped up by an Air Force official and two members of his Secret Service detail.\n\nHe was seen walking back to his seat unassisted and later jogging back to his motorcade when the ceremony ended.\n\n\"There was a sandbag on stage while he was shaking hands,\" White House communications director Ben LaBolt wrote on Twitter. \"He's fine.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Mr Biden had boarded the plane flashing \"a big smile\", although one reporter noted that he did not take questions before the flight.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nCritics have said Mr Biden is too old to run for a second term as president.\n\nRecent polls suggest a majority of US voters are concerned about his advanced age.

The subsidies are likely to be in the form of cash grants, discounts on the cost of energy, and training and research funding.\n\nBut Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the BBC that Tata's decision was based on a wider range of factors.\n\n\"Tata is an international business and will consider a number of factors when deciding where to invest.

If successful, the skatepark's cultural importance would need to be taken into consideration when making management decisions.\n\nListing the site would not prevent it being used as a skatepark, but it would ensure the long-term protection and maintenance of the facility.\n\nHES is seeking input from people who know and use the skatepark, or have a view on its design, history and significance.\n\nSkateboard Scotland, the official governing body for skateboarding in Scotland, helped HES shape the survey.\n\nRick Curran from Skateboard Scotland said: \"Livingston (Livi) skatepark is a world renowned and iconic Scottish skatepark recognised by many for its ground-breaking design, built at a time when skateboarding was experiencing a global slump.\n\nSkateboarding at Livingston in May 1981\n\n\"This design has not only resulted in continuous use by generations of local skaters but has also seen many world-famous pro skaters visit over the years, such as Tony Hawk and Steve Caballero, who recognised Livi's deserved place in skate history.\n\n\"Skateboard Scotland are extremely keen for Livingston to retain the essence that makes it a famously strong foundation for Scottish skateboarding, but also to explore necessary steps to ensure this essence is protected for future generations through sympathetic, considered stabilisation and restoration.\n\n\"We look forward to working with the skate community and HES on this.\"\n\nCurrently the only listed skatepark in the UK is Rom skatepark in London.\n\nWest Lothian councillor Tom Conn said: \"Livingston skatepark is a well-used and much-loved facility by the skating community in West Lothian and further afield.\n\n\"We are aware that different users of the park have wide-ranging views on its future and we would encourage as many people as possible to please take part in this questionnaire.\"\n\nDara Parsons, head of designations at HES, said: \"We know that Livingston skatepark is a hugely popular piece of urban heritage, renowned among skaters across Scotland and beyond.\n\n\"We want to hear views from as many voices as possible to help us understand more about its cultural and historical significance and its position among our 20th Century heritage.\"\n\u2022 None BBC Scotland - The kids saving an 80s skatepark with some help from Tony Hawk", "What we've just seen was like two Budgets in one, or, with the World Cup approaching, what a football fan might call \"a Budget of two halves\".\n\nIn the first half, covering the next couple of years before the next general election, there is support for households, in the form of government spending and further support with energy bills. Extra cash has been found for schools, hospitals and social care, and the chief secretary to the Treasury John Glen hinted to me that some of this could be used for higher wage rises for public sector workers.\n\nThe second half, after 2025, is a different matter. That's where the eye-watering decisions the chancellor warned us about come in: the spending cuts and higher taxes for all. They're needed if the chancellor is to hit his target of getting debt to shrink as a proportion of economic output in five years.\n\nWhether or not this two-pronged plan works isn't just a question of the score after the final whistle in five years time though - and remember the Conservative Party might not even be on the pitch any more by then - it's also about the verdict over the next few days.\n\nImmediate tax rises, on energy companies and the wealthy, mean that tax as a proportion of economic output will rise to levels not seen since the end of World War Two, which some in his party will no doubt view as anti-growth, but the government defends as necessary in a situation where rising energy prices have pushed up our national energy bills by the equivalent of paying for a second NHS and household incomes are falling by the largest amount since records began in 1956.\n\nIn such circumstances Mr Hunt's first priority is to avoid worsening the recession the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says has already started. That's the reason he can't go in hard now with a plan to balance the Budget.\n\nThere are two distinct halves to Hunt's Autumn Statement\n\nThe grim consolidation planned for after 2025 - worth \u00a355bn or 2% of the size of the economy - is a downpayment to the markets. It's Mr Hunt aiming to prove he is serious about fixing the public finances.\n\nThat's just as vital as protecting growth if his plan is to work. The recent sharp increase in interest rates means the government is facing a bill for its own borrowing that's going to top \u00a3100bn a year over the next few years. But that bill could come down if investors are satisfied that the right plan is in place.\n\nUnusually, the position of the opposition, really matters here too. And Labour's shadow Treasury number two Pat McFadden, confirmed to me that his party's current baseline for its economic plans, should it win the next election, is the \u00a354bn fiscal consolidation revealed by the OBR numbers.\n\nPrivately the Labour team suggests if they win the next election, it will be left to them to clean up the Conservative party mess. Publicly they are stressing that they need to show they are serious about financial stability. This suggests we may be heading for a 1997-style situation, when Labour in opposition accepted the very tight spending plans that the outgoing government put in place but might themselves never have enacted at all.\n\nAll these big economic numbers may well evolve before the election; the OBR is certainly due to give several more forecasts before then. But the tramlines for the next half-decade of politics are in place.\n\nFor now the markets seem sufficiently assured that this new team will deal with the deficit. The prime minister and chancellor managed to tell lenders they would immediately be needing \u00a324bn less in funds than thought at the time of the mini-Budget. Labour's broad acceptance helps with the credibility. But the really tough stuff has been pushed out 'til after the election. The unspoken hope here might be that events prove to be far more positive in the coming months - perhaps an end to the war in Ukraine, and the post-pandemic supply bottlenecks.

just one in 10 of those questioned maintain there are major difficulties accessing NHS treatment.\n\nThe NHS also had the sixth-lowest spend on administration, with an outlay of less than 2% of the budget.\n\nThe review noted waiting lists for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, were rising in many countries -

Some families have lost multiple children and this technique is seen as the only option for them to have a healthy child of their own.\n\nMitochondria are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy.\n\nDefective mitochondria fail to fuel the body and lead to brain damage, muscle wasting, heart failure and blindness.\n\nThey are passed down only by the mother. So mitochondrial donation treatment is a modified form of IVF that uses mitochondria from a healthy donor egg.\n\nThere are two techniques for performing mitochondrial donation. One takes places after the mother's egg has been fertilised by the father's sperm and the other takes place before fertilisation.\n\nHowever, mitochondria have their own genetic information or DNA which means that technically the resulting children inherit DNA from their parents and a smidge from the donor as well. This is a permanent change that would be passed down through the generations.\n\nThis donor DNA is only relevant for making effective mitochondria, does not affect other traits such as appearance and does not constitute a \"third parent\".\n\nThe technique was pioneered in Newcastle and laws were introduced to allow the creation of such babies in the UK in 2015.\n\nHowever, the UK did not immediately press ahead. The first baby born via this technique was to a Jordanian family having treatment in the US in 2016.\n\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the HFEA) is saying \"less than five\" babies have been born as of 20 April 2023.

The remaining 17 parties allowed to contest it were too small or too little-known to pose a threat.\n\nA few hours after the polls closed, the CPP claimed the expected landslide, with a turnout of more than 80%. There were quite high levels of spoiled ballot papers in some polling stations: that was probably the only safe way voters could show their support for the opposition.\n\nWith Hun Manet expected to succeed his father within weeks of the vote, in a long-prepared transfer of power, this felt more like a coronation than an election.\n\n\"I don't think we can even call it a sham election,\" says Mu Sochua, an exiled former minister and member of the CNRP, another opposition party banned by the Cambodian authorities in 2017.\n\n\"We should call it a 'selection', for Hun Sen to make sure that his party will select his son as the next prime minister of Cambodia, to continue the dynasty of the Hun family.\"\n\nHun Sen, who has been in power for 38 years, faced no real challenge at the election\n\nYet there were signs of nervousness in the CPP before the vote. New laws were hurriedly passed criminalising any encouragement of ballot-spoiling or a boycott. Several Candlelight members were arrested.\n\n\"Why was the CPP campaigning so hard, against no one in this election with no real opposition?\" asks Ou Virak, founder of the Cambodian think tank Future Forum.\n\n\"They knew they would win the election - that was an easy outcome for them. But winning legitimacy is much more difficult.\n\n\"They need to keep weakening the opposition, but at the same time, they also need to satisfy the people, so there is no repeat of previous setbacks and disruptions, like street protests.\"\n\nHun Sen is one of Asia's great survivors, a wily, street-smart politician who has time and again outmanoeuvred his opponents. He has skilfully played off China, by far the biggest foreign investor these days, against the US and Europe, which are trying to claw back lost influence in the region.\n\nBut he has come close to losing elections in the past. He is still vulnerable, to rival factions in his own ruling party, and to any sudden downturn in the Cambodian economy which could sour public opinion against him. So as he prepares for a once-in-a-generation leadership change, he is trying to cement his legacy.\n\nA short drive north of the capital, a 33m-high concrete-and-marble monolith was built recently, which he calls the Win-Win memorial.\n\nThe Win-Win Memorial opened in 2018 and reportedly cost $12m\n\nIts massive base is covered in carved stone reliefs, echoing Cambodia's greatest historic monument, Angkor Wat.\n\nThey depict Hun Sen's flight from Khmer Rouge-ruled Cambodia to Vietnam in 1977, his triumphant return with the invading Vietnamese army in 1979, and his eventual deal with the last of the Khmer Rouge leaders in 1998 that ended the long civil war - his win-win for the Cambodian people.\n\nDelivering peace and prosperity has long been Hun Sen's main claim to legitimacy. Since 1998, Cambodia has had one of the world's fastest-growing economies, albeit from a very low base.\n\nBut it is a model of growth which has concentrated wealth in the hands of a few families - the number of ultra-luxury cars on the roads of such a low-income country is jarring. It has encouraged rapacious exploitation of Cambodia's natural resources and it has left many ordinary people feeling that they are not winning under Mr Sen.\n\nPrak Sopheap lives with her family at the back of an engine repair shop, squeezed between the main road and one of the many shallow lakes in the low-lying land outside Phnom Penh. They have been there for 25 years, fishing and cultivating vegetables on the lake.\n\nToday, though, much of the lake has been filled with rubble by a property developer and Ms Sopheap's family have been ordered to leave.\n\nShe showed me a document from the local council, confirming how long she had lived there, and another document, a summons to court on a charge of illegally occupying state land. She feels powerless and angry - and she is not alone.\n\nPrak Sopheap has been ordered to leave her home of 25 years\n\nLand disputes are among the most incendiary grievances in Cambodia. All property deeds were destroyed in the Khmer Rouge revolution.\n\nSince the end of the civil war, millions of hectares have been allocated for commercial development, a lucrative arrangement which has made many politicians and businesses allied to Hun Sen very rich.\n\nThe courts very rarely rule against these powerful interests. Transparency International ranks Cambodia as 150th out of 180 countries for corruption: in the Asia-Pacific region, only Myanmar and North Korea rank lower.\n\n\"Hun Sen always talks about his 'win-win policy'\", says Ms Sopheap. \"But we feel it is he alone who wins. We cannot feel at peace, as we now face eviction. We, the real Cambodian people, who live on this land, are suffering in the name of development.\"\n\nThose who have tried to campaign against land grabs and evictions have been harassed, beaten and jailed, as have trade unionists and supporters of opposition parties. I asked Ms Sopheap how she would vote in this election. \"Who can I choose?\" she asked. \"Who can protect me?\"\n\nHalf of those eligible to vote are under 35 years old. The CPP has tried attracting them by having Hun Manet and other younger party leaders run this year's campaign, with a slick social media strategy.\n\nBut as most Cambodians have no memory of war or the Khmer Rouge, Ly Chandravuth, a 23-year-old law graduate and environmental activist, says the old CPP campaign points are no longer persuasive.\n\n\"Hun Manet's biggest challenge will be that my generation is very different from previous ones, who were traumatised by the Khmer Rouge,\" he says.\n\n\"Since I was a child, I have watched the ruling party reminding us of that tragedy, telling us that as they brought peace, we should support them. But that argument is less and less effective. Every time the ruling party brings it up, the young generation mocks them, because they have been repeating it for 30 years.\"\n\nCan Hun Manet modify the rough-house, sometimes thuggish leadership style of his father to a softer and more subtle kind of rule? Despite his Western education, his years heading the army and his long apprenticeship, he has never yet held a top political office.\n\nWith him, other \"princeling\" sons of Hun Sen's contemporaries, such as Defence Minister Tea Banh and Interior Minister Sar Keng, are also expected to replace their fathers in the cabinet - a dynastic shift which keeps the levers of power with the same families, but in less experienced hands.

He is also said to have gone to a shooting range more than once with his father before the killings.\n\nIn a televised address to the country, President Aleksandar Vucic described the attack as \"the most difficult day in the modern history of our country\".\n\nHe said the suspect would be sent to a psychiatric clinic. Under current Serbian law, he cannot be held criminally responsible as he is under 14.\n\nMr Vucic has suggested that the age of criminal liability may be lowered to 12 in the wake of the killings.\n\nHe has also proposed several other reforms, including an audit on firearms licences and a tightening of the rules around who can access shooting ranges.\n\nPolice say the suspect planned the attack a month in advance and that he had carried a \"priority list\" of children to target and which classrooms he would go into first.\n\nFour of those wounded, three boys and another girl, were stable and conscious on Wednesday.\n\nA teacher injured in the attack was also reported to have undergone surgery and the health minister said on Tuesday her life was at risk.\n\nMost of the victims were born in 2009 - meaning they were either 13 or 14 at the time of the incident.\n\nA national three-day mourning period starting on Friday has been announced.\n\nTributes have been laid for the victims of Wednesday's shooting outside the school in central Belgrade\n\nThe sounds of crying parents could be heard on the streets around the school hours after the shooting.\n\nMilan Milosevic, the father of one of the pupils at the school, said his daughter was in the class where the gun was fired and managed to escape.\n\n\"[The boy] first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly,\" Mr Milosevic told broadcaster N1.\n\n\"I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts. They say he [the shooter] was quiet and a good pupil. He recently joined their class.\"\n\n\"I saw kids running out from the school, screaming. Parents came, they were in panic. Later I heard three shots,\" one student told the Serbian state broadcaster RTS.\n\nMr Vucic said the suspect had become friendly with the guard, who was described by one parent as \"a man who loved kids\".\n\nMass shootings are comparatively rare in Serbia, which has very strict gun laws, but gun ownership in the country is among the highest in Europe.\n\nThe western Balkans are awash with illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s.

They were.\n\nBut who ever heard of a nation short-changing its defence priorities out of not wanting to give offence? The fact is that the Australians calculated they had underestimated the Chinese threat and so needed to boost their level of deterrence.\n\nThey acted with steely disregard for French concerns but, when it comes to the crunch, that is what nations do. It is almost the definition of a nation: a group of people who have come together to defend their own interests. Their own, not others'.\n\nOf course, sometimes nations decide their interests are best served by joining alliances. That's what the US did in suppressing its isolationist instincts in the last century.\n\nBut the second painful truth exposed by the Aukus affair is that the US no longer has any great interest in the outdated behemoth that is Nato. Nor does it harbour any particular loyalty to those who have stood by its side.\n\nGaullists in France - and President Emmanuel Macron is one of them - dream of their country as a fully independent power, exercising its force for good thanks to a global presence and nuclear-backed military strength. In practice, and not without considerable reserve, France has bound itself to the US-led alliance because that seemed both moral and expedient.\n\nBut now the questions echo around Paris: Why did we bother? What was in it for us?\n\n\"This blow came completely out of the blue,\" says Renaud Girard, senior foreign affairs analyst at Le Figaro newspaper.\n\n\"Macron made so much effort to help the Anglo-Saxons. With the Americans in Afghanistan; with the British on military co-operation; with the Australians in the Indo-Pacific. Look, he kept saying, we're following you - we are genuine allies.\n\n\"And he made the effort not just with Biden - but with Trump too! All that, and then this. No reward at all. Treated like dogs.\"\n\nThe French will now be re-evaluating their role in Nato. Their military participation in the organisation was suspended by De Gaulle in 1966 and only restored by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. There is no talk, yet, of a second withdrawal. But remember, Emmanuel Macron is the man who described Nato two years ago as \"brain-dead\". He will not have changed his mind.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Australia\u2019s \u2018risky bet\u2019 to side with US over China\n\nBut the third harsh truth is that there is no obvious other way for France to fulfil its global ambitions.\n\nThe lesson of the last week is that France by itself is too small to make much of a dent in strategic affairs. Every four years the Chinese build as many ships as there are in the entire French fleet. When it came to the crunch, the Australians preferred to be close to a superpower, not a minipower.\n\nThe conventional way out of the conundrum has been for the French to say their military future lies in Europe. The EU - with its vast population and technological resources - would be the springboard for France's global mission.\n\nBut 30 years has given nothing beyond a few joint brigades, a bit of procurement planning and minor contingents from Estonia and the Czech Republic in Mali. For Renaud Girard, the idea of the EU as a military force is a \"complete joke\".\n\nAccept realities. Try to form ad hoc alliances (like Macron was indeed trying to do in the Indo-Pacific). Keep pushing the Germans to get over their 20th Century complexes and act like the power they really are.\n\nAnd keep open a doorway to the British. It may not be the easiest of suggestions at the moment. Relations between Paris and London are at their worst level for many years. The French find it hard to conceal their contempt for Boris Johnson, and many in London appear to feel the same way back.\n\nIn the short term, it is quite possible that France will seek to punish the UK for its role in the Aukus affair, says Girard, possibly by scaling back the secret nuclear co-operation that forms part of the 2010 Lancaster Accords. There could be fall-out in other areas too, like the control of cross-Channel migrants.\n\nBut the UK's is Europe's only other serious army. The two countries have similar histories and world experiences. Their soldiers respect each other. In the long term, Franco-British defence co-operation is too logical to ignore. That may be the last of Macron's painful truths.", "Chris Heaton-Harris says the UK government now has more clarity on DUP demands\n\nSecretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris has said he is \"very hopeful\" that the Stormont executive will return in the autumn.\n\nHe said he believed a resolution of the difficulties was \"getting much closer\".\n\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle O'Neill said she did not hear any urgency on the part of the UK government to restore Stormont during her talks.\n\nThe DUP has insisted new legislation is needed before it will end its 18-month boycott over post-Brexit trade rules.\n\nThe party walked out of Stormont's power-sharing executive in February 2022 in protest over a Brexit deal which introduced new checks and restrictions on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary was speaking after holding a series of talks with the main political parties this week.\n\nHe said new legislation may be required at Westminster and the government now has \"a lot more clarity\" about what the DUP is seeking.\n\nSpeaking after her meeting at Hillsborough Castle on Thursday, Ms O'Neill said she made it clear to the secretary of state that the current political vacuum at Stormont was \"totally unsustainable\".\n\n\"All it is serving is to punish the public,\" she said.\n\n\"Whilst people in the DUP take themselves off on summer holidays, families are left struggling; workers and families are left struggling and worried about how they are going to deal with the cost of living.\"\n\nIf you'd asked me where we're at earlier today I would have said in a very bad place, but that's before we heard the optimism pouring out of Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nHe, let's face it, is in a better position to know than us.\n\nLet us see what happens in September before popping any Champagne corks.\n\nWe have to see what the DUP says, because no matter how much people don't like it, there will be no deal unless the DUP says there's a deal.\n\nWe are certainly not there yet.\n\nEarlier, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie predicted the executive would be restored by the autumn.\n\nMr Beattie said his delegation had \"a good conversation\" with the secretary of state at Hillsborough Castle but said he was a realist and admitted that \"the timings are getting tight\".\n\nMr Beattie said there would be a couple of weeks in September when a decision would have to be made and insisted \"that's down to the DUP\".\n\nThe UUP's Robbie Butler and Doug Beattie also met the NI secretary at Hillsborough\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), SDLP and Alliance Party met the secretary of state in London on Wednesday.\n\nAfterwards, the DUP said that the onus was on the government to introduce new legislation at Westminster from September.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak negotiated the Windsor Framework with the EU to address some of the problems created by the post-Brexit Irish Sea border.\n\nBut the DUP said it still had many concerns and submitted an 18-page document to the government outlining its demands before it will return to Stormont.\n\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in delegation told reporters that the party has not seen that document because, so far, it had only been shared with the government.\n\nThe talks are aimed at restoring Stormont's devolved institutions at Stormont which collapsed in February 2022\n\nSpeaking after meeting Mr Heaton-Harris on Wednesday, the DUP's deputy leader, Gavin Robinson, said the government knows what steps are needed to restore devolution.\n\n\"They are going to have to bring forward measures in the House of Commons that address the constitutional issues that we have highlighted,\" he added.\n\nHowever, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the DUP had been given \"far too much road\" and that it was time for the government to get much tougher on them.\n\nSpeaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, the Foyle MP said the DUP \"need to get back to work\" as local people are frustrated.\n\n\"We have a quarter of the population on hospital waiting lists and we have the DUP playing games,\" Mr Eastwood said.\n\nColum Eastwood says he is downbeat about Stormont being restored soon\n\n\"We are in this sort of de facto direct rule situation where the British government is making decisions when we need local people making those decisions.\"\n\nAlliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry said he was \"not entirely sure that the government and the DUP are on the same page\" in terms of requests for new legislation to deal with the DUP's concerns over the Windsor Framework.\n\nStephen Farry from Alliance said he was concerned about Stormont's worsening finances during the wait to restore devolution\n\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster that he too did not know exactly what the DUP has asked for.\n\n\"I hear the rhetoric at times from the DUP.

At the time Arm was listed in London and New York.\n\nThe firm designs the tech behind processors - commonly known as chips - that power devices from smartphones to game consoles.\n\nIts designs are used by chip manufacturers like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and household brands like Apple and Samsung to build their own processors.\n\nSoftbank said it had \"confidentially submitted a draft registration statement\" for the listing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe announcement did not reveal how much it planned to raise or when the share sale might take place.\n\nThe firm was seeking to raise between $8bn and $10bn through the listing this year on the technology-heavy Nasdaq platform in New York, according to reports.\n\nListing a firm on a stock exchange takes it from being a private to a public company, with investors able to buy and sell shares of a company's stock on specific exchanges.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"crown jewel\" of the UK's technology sector, Arm was founded in Cambridge, England, in 1990.\n\nEarlier this year, Arm said it did not plan to pursue a London Stock Exchange listing.\n\nReports in January said that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had restarted talks with Softbank about a possible London listing.\n\nArm's decision raised concerns that the UK market is not doing enough to attract tech company stock offerings, with US exchanges seen to offer higher profiles and valuations.\n\nThe registration shows that Softbank is pushing ahead with the multi-billion dollar sale despite difficult conditions in the global financial markets.\n\nThe number of stock market listings has fallen sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, shares in major technology companies have fallen in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nSoftbank said the listing was \"subject to market and other conditions and the completion of the SEC's review process.\"\n\nLast year, Softbank called off its planned $40bn sale of Arm to technology group Nvidia after facing regulatory hurdles in the UK, US and EU.\n\nAfter an acute shortage of semiconductors during the pandemic, the chip making industry has faced slowing demand.\n\nLast week, US chipmaking giant Intel reported its largest quarterly loss in the company's history, while South Korean rival Samsung posted a more than 90% fall in its profits.\n\nA successful stock market listing of Arm would be welcome news for its owner Softbank. Its Vision Funds have been hit by losses due to the declining valuations of many of its investments in technology start-ups.", "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has returned to the front line near Bakhmut where fighting has raged for months.\n\nThe devastated city has long been a focal point of the war as Russian forces try to revive their military campaign in the east.\n\nHis visit came as Russian forces launched a series of strikes on Ukrainian cities.\n\nAt least eight people were killed near Kyiv and in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUkraine's military said it shot down 16 drones, but another five got through.\n\nSeven people died in an attack on student dormitories near the capital in Rzhyschiv. Then a rocket slammed into a block of flats in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, leaving one dead and 25 wounded. Local leaders said the number of victims could rise.\n\nWhile President Zelensky condemned Russia's \"bestial\" attacks on civilians, he also visited the eastern front line, where Ukrainian forces have held Russia at bay for more than seven months. He last visited the area in December.\n\nFootage released by the President's office showed him in an old industrial warehouse giving medals to battle-weary soldiers. \"I am honoured to be here today,\" he told servicemen, \"in the east of our country, in Donbas, and to award our heroes, to thank you, to shake your hands.\"\n\nUK military intelligence said on Wednesday that a Ukrainian counter-attack to the west of Bakhmut was likely to relieve pressure on the main supply route to the city, and that Russia's attack on the city could be losing the \"limited momentum\" it had.\n\n\"Fighting continues around the town centre and the Ukrainian defence remains at risk from envelopment from the north and south,\" the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian occupation officials in Crimea said that a drone attack on the port city of Sevastopol had been repelled, days after President Vladimir Putin visited the city.\n\nExplosions were reported by residents, but the Russian-installed governor said three \"objects\" targeting the Black Sea Fleet had been destroyed and Russian warships were not damaged.\n\nThere was no comment from Ukraine's military, which said earlier this week it had destroyed missiles destined for the fleet at a rail hub in Dzhankoi in northern Crimea.\n\nUkraine's cities were hit by drones in the early hours of Wednesday and later by rockets.\n\nRescue services searched for survivors after the upper floors of two student dormitories were hit in the city of Rzhyshchiv in Kyiv region. At least seven people were killed, including an ambulance driver, police said. Among the nine wounded was an 11-year-old boy.\n\nHours later, two missiles crashed into nine-storey blocks of flats in Zaporizhzhia, setting two buildings on fire. Officials said one person died in hospital and another 25 people were wounded.\n\nA number of flats were destroyed by the blasts and an air force spokesman indicated they might have been hit by Tornado-S rockets, which have a maximum range of 120km (75 miles).\n\nIn a tweet, Mr Zelensky said residential areas in Zaporizhzhia were being targeted and it could not become \"just another day\" in Ukraine or the rest of the world.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Russian attacks came a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a two-day visit to Moscow, promoting a 12-point peace plan.\n\nThe Ukrainian president noted that every time \"someone tries to hear the word 'peace' in Moscow\", another order was given to launch attacks.\n\nPresident Putin said earlier that many of the Chinese proposals \"can be taken as the basis for [the] settling of the conflict in Ukraine, whenever the West and Kyiv are ready for it\".\n\nThe plan makes no specific proposals and does not call explicitly for Russian forces to leave Ukraine's sovereign territory.", "Boris Johnson should pay back the public money used to cover a \u00a3245,000 bill for his lawyers during the Partygate inquiry, opposition MPs say.\n\nAn inquiry by MPs found the former prime minister had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties.\n\nThe top lawyers defending Mr Johnson were paid for with taxpayer funds.\n\nLabour says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should demand Mr Johnson \"pays back every penny\" of public money used to fund his legal defence.\n\nThe government has sought to justify the decision by claiming there is a precedent for supporting former ministers with legal representation.\n\nBut the government has not been able to name a single example of a former minister receiving taxpayer-funded legal support for a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Conservative ministers had \"utterly failed\" to produce evidence to back up their assertion that funding Mr Johnson's legal defence followed convention.\n\n\"This murky arrangement that has seen the public left to pick up the tab for Boris Johnson's Partygate legal bills is not only without precedent but without justification,\" Ms Rayner said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to \"do the decent thing and force Johnson to pay the bill himself\".\n\n\"It's frankly unbelievable that hardworking taxpayers are being left to foot the bill for Boris Johnson's shameful antics,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said.\n\nThe SNP's leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: \"The legal costs, which the public have paid for, need to be recouped from Mr Johnson.\"\n\nMr Johnson's spokesperson referred to the government's response, explaining there is a long-standing position on legal support, justified by precedent.\n\nThe inquiry by the Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about gatherings in government buildings during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nIn an unprecedented decision, the committee found Mr Johnson had committed repeated contempts of Parliament with his Partygate denials.\n\nIn its conclusions, the committee said criticisms of the inquiry in opinions submitted by Mr Johnson's legal advisers were \"without merit\".\n\nMr Johnson said the inquiry amounted to a \"political assassination\", and branded the committee's findings \"deranged\".\n\nThe Cabinet Office made the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs for the inquiry last year, when he was still prime minister.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to two former ministers who were investigated by MPs for misleading Parliament and were not given legal support.\n\nThe former Labour MP and transport secretary, Stephen Byers, was not offered legal support when he faced a four-month inquiry in 2005.\n\nNor was the former Labour MP and paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, who was found to have \"inadvertently\" misled MPs in 2001.\n\nIn a response to a parliamentary question this week, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin defended the decision to pay Mr Johnson's legal costs.\n\nHe said the principle \"can also be applied to parliamentary inquiries, where it relates to one's conduct as minister of the Crown\".\n\nBut Mr Quin provided no examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for parliamentary inquiries.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe MP who submitted the question, Labour's Karl Turner, said that the Cabinet Office had \"created a precedent\" with the decision to fund Mr Johnson's legal defence.\n\nThis meant there was now a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers receive legal support to fight parliamentary inquiries, and backbench MPs do not, he added.\n\n\"We cannot have a system that unfairly advantages one member as against another member, in terms of having their excessively large legal bills covered by the taxpayer,\" Mr Turner said.\n\n\"Mr Johnson is a multi-millionaire if he wants to instruct the country's leading public lawyers and solicitors then let him pay for it.\"\n\nLast month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.\n\nThe Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.", "Lola James died at the Noah's Ark children's hospital in Cardiff on 21 July, 2020\n\nA mother accused of causing or allowing the death of her two-year-old daughter told police: \"I wouldn't hurt her, she's my baby, my shadow\".\n\nLola James died in hospital as a result of a \"catastrophic\" head injury in July 2020.\n\nSwansea Crown Court heard Sinead James told officers she was not responsible for her daughter's injuries.\n\nThe 30-year-old denies causing or allowing the death of Lola four months after her partner moved in.\n\nHer partner, Kyle Bevan, 31, of Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, denies murdering Lola at their home in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.\n\nMs James told police the first she knew about what had happened was when Mr Bevan ran into her bedroom to tell her she needed to get up, saying: \"There's an ambulance coming for Lola, she's limp.\"\n\nMs James said Mr Bevan later told her the family dog had jumped on Lola and knocked her down the stairs.\n\nShe said she called her mother and an ambulance.\n\nShe then went downstairs to see Lola, who was on the living room sofa.\n\nMs James said she told Mr Bevan to put her down as he began to pick her up.\n\nThe court heard she told police: \"I haven't done anything to her, she's my baby.\"\n\nShe told officers Lola was accident prone with \"two left feet\" and that she \"doesn't sleep and falls over everything\".\n\nShe said: \"I wish I was there, I wish I could have stopped it.\"\n\nWhen asked about her relationship with Mr Bevan, Ms James said they had met online and were sleeping together.\n\nShe said: \"I don't believe for a second he would have hurt her.\"\n\nShe said he was \"amazing\" with Lola.\n\nMs James told police that if she had to choose between Lola and Mr Bevan: \"I'd walk away, his bags would be packed and he'd be gone.\"\n\nWhen she saw video during a police interview of Mr Bevan holding Lola up she wanted to \"punch him in the face\".\n\nPolice said the footage depicted Bevan picking her up and letting her \"flop back\" to \"show his mother she couldn't stand up\".\n\nThe court heard he had not yet called an ambulance when it was filmed.\n\nBefore seeing the footage, Ms James said: \"Why didn't he call an ambulance straight away?\"\n\nAs she watched, Ms James said: \"He's not even holding her properly, I feel sick.\n\n\"I want to punch him in the face. He's probably caused her more damage. Why would he do that to a baby?\"\n\nShe said he should be protecting her and called the video \"sickening\".\n\nThe court heard she told police: \"If he can do that what has actually happened to my baby?\"\n\nShe told them she did not know whether she thought Mr Bevan's behaviour was controlling.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAt least 24 injured people have been taken to hospital after a \"devastating\" tornado hit Little Rock, Arkansas, according to the city's mayor.\n\nThe twister churned through the state's capital city on Friday, flipping cars, smashing roofs and toppling trees.\n\nSeveral blocks have been heavily damaged, according to aerial footage posted by the Weather Channel.\n\nNearly 90 million people in 15 US states are under threat from an \"explosive\" storm system.\n\nA state of emergency has also been declared in Missouri and two tornados were reported in Iowa.\n\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard after what she described as \"significant damage\" in central Arkansas.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nLittle Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr tweeted that the tornado in that city was \"devastating\".\n\nIn a tweet on Friday evening he said that no deaths had yet been reported, but \"property damage is extensive\".\n\nThe University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Medical Center in Little Rock said it was expecting at least 15-20 patients.\n\nBaptist Health Medical Center, the state's biggest hospital, said it had five patients in a critical condition.\n\nIt comes just one week after a rare, long-track twister killed 26 people in Mississippi.

But the coastguard still claims that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue.\n\nGreek officials maintain those on board said they did not want help and were not in danger until just before their boat sank.\n\nThe nine suspects all appeared at the Kalamata Court on Monday to face charges of negligent manslaughter, exposing lives to danger, causing a shipwreck and human trafficking.\n\nAlexandros Dimaresis, a lawyer for one of the accused, said that his client was innocent and \"paid the smugglers to be taken to Europe\".\n\n\"He is not a smuggler himself. He was just a passenger,\" Mr Dimaresis said outside court.\n\nThe suspects will be back in court on Tuesday, when it will be decided whether they will remain in jail until the start of the trial.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani authorities have arrested 14 people in connection with the alleged trafficking of several migrants who drowned in the disaster.\n\nThe government in Islamabad has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the human trafficking network thought to be involved, a statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office said.\n\nAt least 21 of those who are missing came from the Kotli district in Pakistan's part of the Himalayan Kashmir region, police said. Two of the 12 Pakistanis who survived the sinking also came from the same town.\n\nSince the fishing boat carrying up to 750 people went down 50 nautical miles off Pylos in southern Greece, the role of the coastguard has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nThe UN has called for an investigation into Greece's handling of the disaster, amid claims more action should have been taken earlier to initiate a full-scale rescue attempt.", "We've been inundated with reaction to today's interest rate decision by the Bank of England - both in favour and against it.

There is also additional guidance on \u201cindividual use of social media\u201d and impartiality is mentioned in the Royal Charter. And some individuals have particular arrangements in their contracts too (which, needless to say, we can't read).\n\nThis paragraph, from the social media guidance brought in by Tim Davie in 2020, feels most relevant:\n\nQuote Message: There are also others who are not journalists or involved in factual programming who nevertheless have an additional responsibility to the BBC because of their profile on the BBC. We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters.\u201d from BBC Editorial Guidelines There are also others who are not journalists or involved in factual programming who nevertheless have an additional responsibility to the BBC because of their profile on the BBC. We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is far from clear if Gary Lineker ever accepted that this applied to him. He told me on The Media Show in 2021 that Davie had \u201cnever called me up and said you can\u2019t tweet about that.\u201d He went on: \u201cI don\u2019t think he could do that anyway.

The schism is sharply felt in Jerusalem, known for its conservative and religious populations.\n\nPolice arrested three people over threats made in the run-up to the event, while an online watchdog reported a spike in homophobic hate speech.\n\nFar-right Telegram and WhatsApp groups published \"violent and hateful messages\" throughout the week, according to FakeReporter, which monitors online extremism. It said that Lehava, a far-right group, referred to march as the \"abomination parade\" and called for protests accompanied by a message stating that it would be a \"deadly Thursday\".\n\nThe event was sealed by protective barricades while the route was patrolled by hundreds of armed police. Organisers reported a record attendance of 30,000 people after warning of a \"public climate of danger\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAs the rally began, Mr Ben-Gvir - swamped by his armed security team - briefly toured a street running parallel, causing marchers to rush to barricades and shout \"shame\" at him.\n\nMr Ben-Gvir (C) has distanced himself from the anti-LGBTQ beast parades\n\nAsked by the BBC if he was deliberately creating a provocation, Mr Ben-Gvir said: \"Perhaps our mere existence is a provocation. For you, that Jews live is a provocation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a few dozen ultra-religious and far-right protesters, organised by Lehava, were separated by police from the Gay Pride rally. Banners read: \"Don't let them have children\" and \"Jerusalem is not Sodom\", in reference to the biblical city supposedly destroyed by God for the sin of homosexuality.\n\nIt comes in a year which has seen an unprecedented clash between secular Israelis and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, culminating in weekly protests against the coalition's now-delayed plans to strip powers from the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Netanyahu has rejected claims his coalition would erode LGBTQ rights. He tweeted during the event: \"I am proud that Israel is one of the most open countries in the world in relation to the gay community and that the discourse in it has become more accepting and respectful every year.\"\n\nGay Pride marcher Elisa Gilman stood with a sign offering \"free hugs\" to younger participants who \"haven't had a hug from a parent for a while\" due to their sexuality.\n\nShe told the BBC a lot of gay people were \"worried\" by the current coalition.\n\n\"Many have said 'I will be here this year because of that - I cannot allow who is in government to affect the fact that this is who I am and this is my life',\" said Ms Gilman who described herself as an \"ally\" to the LGBTQ community.\n\nAnother marcher, Yuval from Jerusalem, who declined to give his surname, told the BBC: \"We're here today to say that we are here to stay and that we will not give up.\"\n\n\"Our government is the most homophobic and transphobic it has ever been. The minister of police who is here supposedly protecting us - until last year he came here to protest against us,\" he said.\n\nIn 2006, Mr Ben-Gvir attended a so-called beast parade against Gay Pride, in which religious activists led goats and donkeys through the streets and hoisted banners calling LGBTQ people \"impure\". Two years later, he was photographed kicking a trans woman at Gay Pride in Tel Aviv. He later claimed it was in self-defence.\n\nMr Ben-Gvir has since distanced himself from the beast parade and reportedly described LGBTQ people as his \"brothers and sisters\".\n\nIn the run-up to this week's event he toured police headquarters saying the marchers must be kept safe, but that those opposing it must also be allowed to protest.\n\nEarlier, the Islamist militant group Hamas had also denounced the parade as \"provocative\" and called on Palestinians to confront it.", "Tottenham: Ange Postecoglou leaves Celtic to become new Spurs manager Last updated on .From the section Tottenham\n\nPostecoglou struggled in his early weeks at Celtic but guided the club to two league titles Tottenham Hotspur have appointed Ange Postecoglou as their new manager on a four-year contract. The 57-year-old leaves Celtic after winning successive Scottish Premiership titles in his two seasons in charge. He is Spurs' fourth permanent manager since Mauricio Pochettino led them to the Champions League final in 2018-19, following Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte. \"We are excited to have Ange join us,\" said Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. \"Ange brings a positive mentality and a fast, attacking style of play. He has a strong track record of developing players and an understanding of the importance of the link from the academy - everything that is important to our club,\" he added. Spurs have been searching for a new manager since Conte's departure in March, with Cristian Stellini and then Ryan Mason taking charge on an interim basis. Postecoglou - the first Australian to manage in the Premier League - arrives at Tottenham after winning a domestic treble in Scotland, where he has claimed five of the six trophies available to Celtic during his two campaigns with the club. He is one of only five managers - along with Jock Stein, Martin O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers and Neil Lennon - to secure a domestic clean sweep with Celtic. \"It has been a pleasure working with Ange, a great football manager and a good man. He has served the club with such energy and determination and delivered a phenomenal level of success,\" Celtic chief executive Michael Nicholson said. \"Of course, we wanted Ange to stay at Celtic and while there is real disappointment we are losing him, he has decided he wants to look at a new challenge, which we respect.\"\n\u2022 None All the best reaction to Postecoglou's appointment in one place\n\u2022 None The boy from Greece who has become Tottenham's main man\n\u2022 None He was four guys in one - how do Celtic replace Postecoglou? Spurs have spent 10 weeks searching for Conte's successor, with Julian Nagelsmann, Luis Enrique, Arne Slot, Graham Potter, Julen Lopetegui, Rodgers and Pochettino all linked with the role at some point. Since losing 2-0 against Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final, they have claimed just one top-four finish in the subsequent four seasons. Postecoglou is no stranger to arriving at a club facing a significant task though, having taken over Celtic in the summer of 2021 after they had finished the season 25 points behind champions Rangers. When he arrived at Celtic, chief executive Peter Lawwell had been replaced by Dominic McKay, Nick Hammond stepped down as head of football operations and long-serving captain Scott Brown left to join Aberdeen. There are several similarities as he walks through the door at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with chairman Levy searching for a new sporting director following the exit of Fabio Paratici, who resigned after losing his appeal against a 30-month ban from football. Addressing the uncertainty surrounding the future of striker Harry Kane - with Real Madrid showing interest in the England captain - will be high on the agenda this summer as the new manager looks to shape a squad capable of taking Tottenham back into the Champions League. Postecoglou won five trophies across two seasons with Celtic Postecoglou's playing career was spent in Australia, primarily with South Melbourne, where he played under Ferenc Puskas, the legendary Hungarian to whom he attributes his coaching philosophy. He stepped into management in 1996 with South Melbourne before winning back-to-back A-League titles with Brisbane Roar between 2009 and 2012. After a season with Melbourne Victory he became manager of Australia in 2013 and guided his country to the 2014 World Cup as well as victory in the 2015 Asian Cup. Further silverware followed during his time in Japan with Yokohama F Marinos, where he ended the club's 15-year wait for a J-League title in 2019. Few in Scotland knew much about Postecoglou when Celtic appointed their new manager two years ago, but after initially struggling he delivered five trophies across two seasons.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Spurs - go straight to all the best content", "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nBallon d'Or winner Karim Benzema has agreed terms on a three-year deal with Saudi Arabian champions Al-Ittihad after leaving Real Madrid.\n\nFrench striker Benzema, 35, won 25 trophies - including five Champions Leagues and four La Ligas - in 14 years with Madrid but they agreed to let him leave his contract a year early.\n\nHe scored 354 goals for Real, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nRonaldo, who hit 450 Real goals, plays for another Saudi club, Al-Nassr.\n\n\"It's a good league and there are many good players,\" said Benzema. \"Cristiano Ronaldo is already there, a friend which shows Saudi Arabia is starting to further progress its level.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available. In return for the invitation to talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices. Sometimes they ran on beyond midnight. They knew the outcome of their work would be vitally important for the whole NHS in England.\n\nSteve Barclay was present for much of the process, as was health minister Will Quince - though he had to take his leave one day because the King was visiting his constituency.\n\nAccording to one union source: \"Steve Barclay was constructive and there was not the heated atmosphere seen before Christmas.\"\n\nOne government source describes the secretary of state's style: \"What gets him going is seeing a problem through - like a maths problem - he doesn't make a big noise and gets his head down.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay was \"constructive\" in talks, a union source said\n\nThere were tensions at times, but no serious fallings out. Late on Wednesday evening a deal was done. Exhausted participants retired, relieved but knowing it had to be sold to members.\n\nRachel Harrison of the GMB reflects on the outcome: \"They were very long days locked on the ninth floor but it was what we asked for - we wanted to be invited in and they did.\"\n\nUnions had insisted before entering the talks that it had to be \"new money\" which funded any pay offer. Ministers, after the deal, said the funding would not come from NHS frontline budgets.\n\nBut there is still ambiguity about the source of the money, with government sources saying some would come from existing planned Department of Health and Social Care spending and the rest after negotiation with the Treasury.\n\nThe pay dispute started with ministers insisting that they would follow recommendations of the pay review body and not negotiate directly with unions. But it was face-to-face talks which broke the deadlock.\n\nThe deal - a one off payment and a 5% pay rise for the year starting in April - included an agreement to review the composition and remit of the PRB.\n\nYet this is not the end of the process. The dispute will only end once health union members give their approval - and that is far from certain.\n\nThere is a separate and ongoing doctors' pay row. There are different pay discussions in Scotland and Wales.\n\nBut strikes which have caused frustrating delays for patients and damaged staff morale have for now come to an end in England. As one union source reflects: \"What a shame it took so long.\"", "Six months after the Hamas attacks on Israel, war, disease, starvation and death ravage Palestinians in Gaza. Israel is deeply divided, as its prime minister struggles to keep his promise of total victory. The United States, Israel's most essential ally, has turned against the way it is fighting the war.\n\nWith Iran vowing vengeance for Israel's assassination of a leading Iranian general in Syria, and months of cross-border conflict with Iran's ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, the risks of an all-out Middle East war are increasing.\n\nThe statistics record the horrors of the past six months. More than 33,000 Gazans, a majority of whom were civilians, have been killed, according to the health ministry. According to Save the Children, 13,800 Palestinian children in Gaza have been killed and over 12,009 wounded. Unicef reports at least 1,000 children have had one or both legs amputated.\n\nMore than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas on 7 October, and 253 people were taken into Gaza as hostages. Israel says that of 130 hostages still there, at least 34 are dead. A UN team reported in March that it had \"clear and convincing information\" that hostages had been subjected to sexual violence \"including rape, sexualised torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\". It said there were \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the violence against hostages was continuing.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nKibbutz Nir Oz is right on Israel's border with Gaza. It feels like a time capsule still stuck in the horrors of 7 October 2023. Just after first light on that morning, Hamas broke through the wire. By the time the Israeli army arrived in the early afternoon, a quarter of the 400 or so Israelis who lived there had either been killed by Hamas or taken hostage.\n\nRon Bahat showed me around. He is a man in his 50s who grew up at Nir Oz. Ron survived with his family through good luck and arms strong enough to hold shut the door of the safe room when Hamas entered his house.\n\nWe walked along the neat lines of small houses, with gardens that are now overgrown. Many had bullet holes or were burnt out and had not been disturbed since the bodies of the dead were recovered. Ron pointed out the homes of friends and neighbours who were killed or taken as captives to Gaza. In one badly damaged house, a pile of neatly ironed children's clothes had somehow survived the fire. The family who lived there did not.\n\nChildren\u2019s jackets and a schoolbag still hang on the wall of one burned-out home\n\nOne grim irony is that Nir Oz is part of a left-wing movement whose members traditionally support the idea of peace with the Palestinians. Six months after Hamas crossed into Nir Oz, Ron is not ready to make any concessions to Gaza.\n\n\"Look, I wish that there will be a leader to bring some prosperity there, because in the end we must have peace. But anyone who supports Hamas is an enemy. The moment they leave their weapons, the war will stop. The moment that Israel leaves its weapons, we will not exist. That's the difference.\"\n\nIn Nir Oz, broken glass still crunches underfoot and gutted houses smell of burnt wood and plastic. No-one is there to clean it up. A few of the surviving residents have come back on short visits, but most are staying away, living in hotels in central Israel.\n\nYamit Avital in Nir Oz kibbutz, near the border fence with Gaza\n\nYamit Avital was back for a few hours, showing around a friend. On that morning in October, she had been staying in Tel Aviv. Her husband was at home and escaped with the children. His brother, living not far away, was killed. Yamit's hands shook slightly when she was talking about coming back to live in Nir Oz again.\n\n\"I don't know, it's too early\u2026 Maybe only when the hostages come back we can start to think about it. We can't think about it now. I have too many friends there, in Gaza.\"\n\nNo-one has been able to show me around the ruins of Khan Younis or Gaza City, or the tents of around 1.4 million displaced civilians in Rafah, in the way Ron Bahat showed me Nir Oz. That's because international journalists can't report from Gaza, as Israel and Egypt, in control of the borders, have not allowed them in. The only exception has been invitation-only, highly supervised trips organised by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). I have been on one, to northern Gaza in early November. Only a month or so into the war, Israeli firepower had already reduced the area to a wasteland.\n\nEvidence is accumulating that both Hamas and Israel may have committed war crimes. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague is investigating Israel for \"plausible\" allegations of genocide against the Palestinians in a case brought by South Africa. The ICJ cannot try a case against Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the US and UK, and many others, as it is not a state.\n\nIsrael rejects the charge that it is guilty of genocide. For many of its citizens and supporters it is grotesque and offensive to allege that the state created after Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust is itself committing genocide. One of Israel's lawyers, Tal Becker, told the justices in court in The Hague that \"the appalling suffering of civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, is first and foremost the result of Hamas' strategy\".\n\nPalestinians see the charges through a different lens, shaped by years of military occupation by Israel. Many Palestinians believe Israel has already created an apartheid state that denies them the most basic rights. In Jerusalem at Easter, a prominent Palestinian Christian political activist, Dimitri Diliani, told me that \"killing children is killing children. It doesn't matter who is the child that's being killed. It doesn't matter who is doing the killing\".\n\n\"I recognise the Holocaust, but that does not mean a green light for Israel to commit genocide against my people or any other people.\"\n\nThe ICJ's deliberations will take years and Israel's accusers will have to prove intent to win their case. War and the deaths of civilians do not add up to genocide on their own. South Africa's legal team argues that statements like the one made by Israel's defence minister Yoav Gallant on 9 October show genocidal intent. \"I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,\" he said after visiting the IDF Southern Command in Beersheba. \"We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\"\n\nIsrael was forced by international pressure, especially from Washington, to loosen aspects of the blockade that the minister envisaged. The amounts reaching Gaza were still grossly inadequate. Six months later, Gaza is facing imminent famine, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) a body backed by governments, the UN and aid groups to provide rigorous and apolitical information and analysis in a food emergency. Oxfam reports that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since January on an average of 245 calories a day - the equivalent of a tin of beans.\n\nGaza's humanitarian catastrophe has also been recorded in detail by Palestinian journalists, civilians posting on social media, and the international organisations running the aid operation, whose staff are allowed to enter the territory. Seven from the World Central Kitchen (WCK), which had been providing millions of meals, were killed by the Israeli army on 1 April.\n\nTheir deaths outraged President Biden and other Western leaders who are staunch allies of Israel. Their condemnation of the killings left Israel even more isolated. Israel expects no sympathy from much of the world. But it has come to expect support and understanding from powerful Western allies. Instead, they have rejected Israel's claim it does not impede the movement of relief supplies.\n\nPresident Biden extracted unusually rapid concessions from Israel, which promised greater humanitarian access to Gaza in a statement rushed out in the middle of the night here in Jerusalem. Perhaps he threatened to attach conditions to the use of American weapons in Gaza.\n\nThe killing of the WCK team seems to have been a tipping point for President Biden, whose backing for Israel has been a constant throughout his long career in politics. Supporting Israel is still his firm principle, but the US is no longer prepared to turn that into a safety net for Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist coalition partners.\n\nNetanyahu has an interest to lengthen the war as much as he can, because as long as the war is still going on, he can say that now is not the time for elections.\n\nPalestinians ask, with some anger and frustration, why it took the deaths of seven aid workers, including six Westerners, to make a difference, after so many thousands of Gazans had been killed. Aid agencies operating in Gaza say the attack on the aid workers was not an isolated incident, but the result of an engrained disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nPresident Biden's outrage might have been a long time coming but it could create a turning point in the war. Over the next month or so, one way of assessing change is simply to count whether Israel is killing fewer Palestinian civilians, or whether increased food and medical aid can save Gaza from famine. Another test will be whether Mr Netanyahu defies American opposition and goes ahead with a ground assault on Rafah, where Israel says the remaining organised units of Hamas must be destroyed. The US says that must not happen until Israel can find a way to protect the lives of almost 1.5 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has delivered the \"mighty vengeance\" he promised Israelis on 7 October. His other promises, of total victory, the destruction of Hamas, and the return of the hostages have not been achieved. Inside Israel, he faces severe political pressure. His approval ratings in opinion polls have plummeted.\n\nIn the past week in Jerusalem thousands of protestors waving Israeli flags blocked streets around the parliament demanding the resignation of the prime minister and new elections.\n\n\"Netanyahu has an interest to lengthen the war as much as he can, because as long as the war is still going on, he can say that now is not the time for new elections,\" said Nava Rosalio, one of the leaders of the anti-Netanyahu movement. Her group is called Busha in Hebrew, which translates as Shame.\n\n\"He says now is not the time to look for who is responsible, which is he. So he prefers to keep the hostages in Gaza, and he prefers to lengthen the war.\"\n\nWhen Hamas attacked, Israel was deeply divided over his government's right-wing policies and culture wars between secular and religious Israelis. In the shock that followed reservists who had suspended their military service as part of the protests rushed back into uniform. Demonstrations were paused in the interests of national unity.\n\nSix months on, it is no longer considered unpatriotic to protest against the failure to end the war and free the hostages. Israel's divisions are wide open once more.\n\nProtesters in Jerusalem call for Prime Minister Netanyahu to resign\n\nMr Netanyahu faces searing accusations that his priority is his own political survival. To stay in power, he must preserve his coalition, which is built around the support of ultranationalist Jewish parties. They do not only oppose the mass release of Palestinian security prisoners to buy the freedom of Israeli hostages, without which a ceasefire will not happen. Mr Netanyahu's two main ultranationalist allies, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, go further. They both want Palestinians to leave Gaza so Jews can settle there instead.\n\nThe prime minister, renowned for his skills in the dark arts of politics, is performing a balancing act to keep them happy while denying that Mr Smotrich and Mr Ben-Gvir's views reflect government policy.\n\nBefore October, Israel's divisions must have made it look vulnerable to Hamas. Six months on, the same schisms within Israel about the present and the future are making it harder to win the war.\n\nCapturing or killing Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza and mastermind of the 7 October attacks, would give Israel a chance to declare victory. But he is still alive, sending his responses to proposals in successive rounds of ceasefire talks from wherever he is hiding. He is thought to be somewhere in the Hamas tunnel network, protected by bodyguards and a human shield of Israeli hostages.\n\nYahya Sinwar must be disappointed that Palestinians on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem have not risen up in support of Gaza. Some must be taking the long view, waiting to see how events unfold in Gaza and the wider Middle East. Others are struggling to feed their families now that thousands of Palestinians are no longer allowed to work in Israel. Some are scared.\n\nIsrael has launched many deadly raids against armed groups in the West Bank, killing innocent bystanders in the process and arresting thousands who are being held without trial. Some Palestinian farmers have been driven off their land after violent and sometimes deadly intimidation by extremist Jewish settlers.\n\nThe Palestinians have been in the struggle for 75 years. What happened on Oct 7th is just one thing that happened in many long years of oppression.\n\nOpinion polls show strong support among Palestinians for the attacks on 7 October, though many deny the evidence that Hamas committed atrocities. At a noisy demonstration against the Israelis in Ramallah in the West Bank, I asked Joharah Baker, a Palestinian activist, whether the Hamas attacks had moved the Palestinians any closer to independence from Israeli rule. She said that was not the point.\n\n\"What happened on 7 October is just one thing that happened in many long years of oppression\u2026 Our struggle will continue until we are free. That is what any people under occupation, under oppression, under colonial settlers will do.\"\n\nAccording to the leading Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shikaki, even those who dislike Hamas approve of the way its attacks have put the Palestinian desire for independence back on the political map of the Middle East. The war has accelerated a new way for that to happen. His latest polls indicate that younger Palestinians do not think the two-state solution of an independent Palestine alongside Israel will ever emerge.\n\nInstead, he says, a plurality of under-30s want a single state between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan, in which they believe they could fight and win democratic rights. They compare their fight with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and believe they have a Palestinian Nelson Mandela waiting in an Israeli jail. He is Marwan Barghouti, imprisoned since 2002 and serving five life sentences for murder. If he ran for president, the indications are that he would win easily. Even though he is a leader of the rival Palestinian faction, Fatah, Hamas put Marwan Barghouti's name on the list of prisoners they want released in exchange for hostages.\n\nProtesters in Ramallah in the West Bank chant support for the Palestinians of Gaza\n\nIt is impossible to see Jewish Israelis ever giving up the Jewish nature of their state. The fact that Palestinians see that as a possibility is another sign of the distance between them.\n\nSix months into the war, there is no immediate sign that it is ending. Benjamin Netanyahu has avoided any specifics about how Gaza would be governed when this war ends, except for insisting that Israel must be in control - in other words, an occupation.\n\nHe has rejected America's proposal to replace Israeli troops with a force from the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. The Americans want a PA, revitalised, eventually to govern Gaza. That would most likely require new leadership. Current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is elderly and hugely unpopular. Palestinians say he has failed to fight corruption, failed to show sympathy for Gaza, and failed to order the Palestinian police to protect them from aggressive Jewish settlers while he continues security cooperation with Israel.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has also rejected Joe Biden's idea of a grand bargain that would transform the Middle East. In return for allowing Palestinian independence, Israel would be recognised by Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis would get a NATO-style defence agreement with the US. Instead, the prime minister tells Israelis that he is the only man who can save them from the mortal hazard of a Palestinian state imposed by America. That is music for the ultranationalists in his government, who are much keener to keep the West Bank and all of Jerusalem than make a deal with Saudi Arabia.\n\nPalestinians gather to receive free food in Gaza last month\n\nAway from the conference rooms where leaders discuss the future, the war has created another enormous obstacle to peace. Palestinians and Israelis have not been as suspicious of each other since the turbulent decades of assassination, hijackings and war in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe pollster Khalil Shikaki identifies an accelerated mutual process of dehumanisation since 7 October.\n\n\"The Palestinians are not seen as partners for peace. They are not seen as people who deserve equality because of what they have done on 7 October. So, they [Israelis] question their humanity. We see similar developments, unfortunately, also among Palestinians, who see what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"And they say those who are targeting women and children, deliberately killing entire families, demolishing entire neighbourhoods cannot be humans as well. So, they see them as monsters.\n\n\"This dehumanisation is absolutely disastrous for the future.\"", "Chloe Mitchell was last seen between ten and eleven days ago\n\nA 26-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of 21-year-old Chloe Mitchell in County Antrim.\n\nBrandon John Rainey of James Street, Ballymena, was charged with murdering Ms Mitchell between 2 and 5 June.\n\nMs Mitchell was last seen in the County Antrim town on the night of 2 June and into the early hours of 3 June.\n\nA huge search operation got under way and, on Sunday, suspected human remains were found.

Rishi Sunak was quizzed about his childcare policy by MPs in March.\n\nThe list has not been updated for nearly a year and was last compiled by Lord Geidt, who resigned as Boris Johnson's ethics adviser.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said that the commissioner was investigating whether Mr Sunak was not clear that he had dual obligations to declare the connection as a ministerial interest and also to declare it when speaking to MPs about the issue.\n\n\"The prime minister has set out in his response to the Liaison Committee that he is confident the appropriate process has been followed to avoid or mitigate any potential conflict of interest, and that the interest of ministers' spouses or partners is not something that would influence their actions either as ministers or as members of parliament,\" he said.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner MP said the failure to update the rules or publish the register of ministers' interests had \"left a transparency black hole which is enabling the prime minister and those he has appointed to dodge proper scrutiny of their affairs\".\n\nShe added: \"If Rishi Sunak has got nothing to hide, he should commit to publishing the register before May's elections so the public can see for themselves.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said the investigation was another example of a Conservative prime minister allegedly \"bending the rules\".\n\n\"After months of Conservative sleaze and scandal, the public just want a government which is focused on the country, rather than saving their own skin,\" Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said.\n\nAn update on the commissioner's website says Mr Sunak is being investigated under paragraph 6 of the code of conduct for MPs.\n\nThe paragraph reads: \"Members must always be open and frank in declaring any relevant interest in any proceeding of the House or its committees, and in any communications with ministers, members, public officials or public office holders.\"\n\nThe commissioner for standards is an independent officer who investigates allegations that MPs have breached Parliament's code of conduct.\n\nFollowing investigation, if the watchdog thinks the allegation represents a breach of the code, they can put such cases before MPs sitting on the Committee on Standards, who can decide any sanctions.\n\nBreaching the rules on standards can lead to serious consequences for some MPs, including suspension from the House of Commons. There are many of these investigations every year but most end with a minor telling off from the commissioner.\n\nMr Johnson has been a serial offender when it comes to the late declaration of earnings and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had to apologise for something similar last year.\n\nThe rules are there for a reason though and it is all about transparency. MPs have a duty to be open about their financial affairs so colleagues and the public can assess whether there is any conflict of interest.\n\nThe whole system is undermined if MPs fail to follow the rules for whatever reason and most would expect a prime minister to be particularly careful about the paperwork.\n\nThe rules around lobbying in Parliament were tightened up in an updated version of the code of conduct, which was published in February following the controversy over paid advocacy work undertaken by former MP Owen Paterson.\n\nThe pilot of bonuses for childminders was announced in the Budget on 15 March as part of the government's overhaul of childcare.\n\nMr Hunt said the government would be \"piloting incentive payments of \u00a3600 for childminders who sign up to the profession, rising to \u00a31,200 for those who join through an agency\".\n\nThe pilot could drive up the number of childminders entering the profession and generate more business for companies such as Koru Kids.\n\nKoru Kids is listed as one of six childminder agencies on the government's website.\n\nOn its website, Koru Kids welcomed the government's reforms and said \"the new incentives open to childminders are great\".\n\nThe website says new childminders would get a bonus of \u00a31,200 if they \"come through an agency like Koru Kids who offer community, training and ongoing support\".", "UK airlifts at an airstrip near Khartoum ended on Saturday\n\nTwo extra evacuation flights carrying British nationals have left Sudan, as UK efforts now turn to diplomacy and humanitarian aid.\n\nThe \"exceptional\" flights - billed as the last UK airlift from Sudan - took off from Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast on Monday evening.\n\nMilitary rescue flights from an airstrip near the Sudanese capital Khartoum ended on Saturday.\n\nNearly 2,200 people had been evacuated as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said it would release passenger numbers for the two latest flights on Tuesday.\n\nBritish nationals and others, including Sudanese NHS staff, were asked to travel to Port Sudan by midday on Monday for the \"additional exceptional\" flights.\n\nThe Foreign Office would not confirm the movements of the flights, but a flight tracking website showed a RAF transport Hercules aircraft had landed in Larnaca, Cyprus, at 22:45 local time (20:45 BST).

The scammer's social media account was then deleted before BBC News had the chance to report it to Instagram.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, the company that owns Instagram, said the sale of future exam papers or answer sheets was not allowed and any such content would be removed from the platform.\n\nBill Hewison, a case analyst at exam board, AQA, said many scammers use doctored images of previous exams, changing the date and text on the front cover to try to dupe students.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, we saw an account claiming to sell one of our exams for \u00a37.50,\" he said.\n\n\"Right at the other end of the scale, you've got thousands of pounds [being quoted] - two, three, four thousand pounds.\"\n\nBBC News was granted exclusive access to see how AQA's malpractice teams try to shut down the fraudulent accounts.\n\nThey do not know who is behind the accounts, but they have scoured social media for anyone claiming to sell papers to students, before and during exam season.\n\nExam boards have no power to shut the accounts down so instead, they report them to social media platforms - often citing copyright as a way to escalate the complaint.\n\nA spokesperson for TikTok said any accounts \"promoting fraud or scams\" are removed.\n\nSnapchat said they take fraudulent accounts off the platform and urged users to report suspicious activity.\n\nIn 2019, exam board Edexcel apologised after part of an A-level maths paper was shared on social media the day before the exam.\n\nBut legitimate leaks are rare - and fraudulent accounts on social media are a growing problem.\n\n\"If we do a search on Tuesday, we will see five accounts. If we do the same search on Wednesday, we will see 10 accounts,\" Mr Hewison said.\n\n\"If you get one, they'll just create another account.\"\n\nJCQ chief executive Margaret Farragher said it was like \"digital whack-a-mole\".\n\n\"As soon as they try to close down one of these fake accounts, another one opens up,\" she added.\n\nOfqual chief regulator Jo Saxton told students not to rely on \"fraudsters on the internet\" ahead of their exams.\n\n\"You risk not only losing money but the consequences for you are really serious,\" she said.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

We calculate there would need to be 3% on average [extra] funding for schools in order to do that.\"\n\nAsked whether she feared the government could overrule the pay review body, Dr Bousted said: \"Unfortunately I think that's entirely possible. We hope that that's not the case.\"\n\nThe NEU is balloting for further strike action in the autumn, which could involve co-ordinated strikes with three other education unions.\n\nDr Bousted said autumn strike action would not happen if a fully-funded 6.5% rise was offered, saying it was \"in the government's hands\".\n\nMost state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise for the year 2022-23.\n\nThe NEU wants teachers to have an above-inflation pay increase, plus extra money to ensure any pay rises do not come from schools' existing budgets.\n\nAfter intensive talks, the government offered an additional one-off payment of \u00a31,000. It also offered a rise for most teachers next year of 4.3%, with starting salaries reaching \u00a330,000.\n\nThe Department for Education described it as a \"fair and reasonable offer\", and said schools would receive an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years.\n\nAll four unions involved in the dispute rejected the offer.\n\nAlmost 40,000 full-time working-age teachers left the profession last year - the highest level since records began in 2010 - according to government data released last month.\n\nHowever, overall the number of teachers has increased by 2,800 to 468,400, because more teachers have entered the profession.\n\nAre you a teacher with a view on the strike?

Despite the significant progress in the last 20 years, some dissident groups continue to carry out attacks.\"\n\nTo conclude, she said: \"The threat continues to evolve and is increasing, meaning we must also evolve to keep the British people safe. We will work with the public and our international allies.\"\n\nIn the strategy, the Home Office states: \"In the UK, the primary domestic threat comes from Islamic terrorism, which accounts for approximately 67% of attacks in 2018, about three quarters of MI5 caseload and 64% of those in custody for terrorism-connected offences.\"\n\nThe report goes on to say that the \"domestic terror threat\u2026 is less predictable, harder to detect and investigate.\"\n\nIt points out there is \"a persistent and evolving threat from Islamist terrorist groups overseas\".\n\nAnd it says there is \"an operating environment where accelerating advances in technology provide both opportunity and risk to our counter-terrorism efforts.\"\n\nIt concludes: \"It is within this context that we judge that the risk from terrorism is once again rising.\"\n\nThe government said it was also monitoring the risk posed by the so-called incel movement.\n\nThe incel movement is an online subculture to which multiple mass murders and hate crimes against women have been attributed.\n\nIncel is short for \"involuntary celibate\". People who define themselves as incel say they can't get a sex life despite the fact that they want to be in a relationship.\n\nThe strategy says: \"It is possible that violent adherents to movements and subcultures, such as Involuntary Celibacy (Incels), could meet the threshold of terrorist intent or action.\"\n\nOn prisoners, the strategy says: \"Those convicted of terrorism, or a related offence, may continue to pose a threat; four of the nine declared terrorist attacks in the UK since 2018 were perpetrated by serving or recently released prisoners.\n\n\"Individuals convicted of non-terrorism offences may also hold a terrorist mindset or develop one during their time in prison.\n\n\"The attacks by prisoners inside HMP Whitemoor, the 2019 Fishmongers' Hall and 2020 Streatham and Reading attacks by those on probation, demonstrate the significant threat that offenders may continue to pose both in custody and on release.\"\n\nThe last time this strategy was published was in 2018, after a significant year of terror attacks in the UK in 2017 including the Manchester Arena bombing and London Bridge stabbing attacks.

Sanchez made the same move for \u00a325m.\n\nBrighton fans of a certain age still have to pinch themselves when they think about how far the club has come in the past 30 years.\n\nFrom struggling in the depths of the Football League and facing liquidation in 1997, the Seagulls' stunning rise has been remarkable.\n\nFormer chairman Dick Knight saved the club when his consortium purchased the majority of shares, before stepping down for sports betting entrepreneur Bloom to take over in 2009.\n\nBloom financed the building of the Amex Stadium - a fundamental part of Brighton's renaissance - as well as delivering a state-of-the-art training ground.\n\nBloom's interest-free loans enabled investment off the pitch and led to success on it.\n\nBrighton reached the Premier League for the first time in 2017, establishing themselves as one of the most attractive and progressive teams in the English top flight.\n\n\"As ever we are hugely grateful to Tony Bloom for his clear vision, his world class ownership of our club, and his ongoing financial support,\" added Barber.\n\n\"Similarly, we are extremely fortunate to have a top quality board, who provide us with great stability and guidance;

Dr Eriksen says scientists are not sure why this is, but it could be explained by stronger legislation being replaced by voluntary agreements, the breakdown of plastics, or the fact that less data was collected.\n\nProf Richard Thompson at Plymouth university, who was not involved in the study, said the estimate adds to what scientists know about marine pollution.\n\n\"We are all agreed there is too much plastic in the ocean. We urgently need to move to solutions-focused research,\" he told BBC News.\n\nThe highest concentration of ocean plastic is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, with some large floating masses found elsewhere including the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\nThe authors also suggest that the changing levels of pollution before 2000 may be due to the effectiveness of treaties or policies that govern pollution.\n\nIn the 1980s several legally-binding international agreements mandated countries to stop discarding fishing and naval plastics in the oceans, as well as to clean up certain amounts.\n\nThese were later followed by voluntary agreements which the authors say may have been less effective, and could explain the rise in plastics from around 2000 onwards.\n\nThe authors argue that solutions must focus on reducing the amount of plastic produced and used, rather than cleaning up oceans and recycling plastics because this is less likely to stop the flow of pollution.\n\nThe research was published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I try to take cooling and water breaks when I can.\"\n\nEast coast night-time lows between now and the weekend will be as much as 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above average for the region, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\n\nThe largest US power grid operator, PJM, issued a level one emergency on Thursday for the 13-state eastern US grid in anticipation of an increased demand for electricity.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAnd record-breaking heat continues to bake the Southwest and Central US.\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, has now endured 28 consecutive days with the mercury at or above 110F (43C).\n\nThe evenings have offered little respite - overnight temperatures have not dropped below 90F (32C) for at least 16 days.\n\nEl Paso, Texas, has surpassed even Phoenix, hitting 42 consecutive days of temperatures at or above 100F (38C) on Thursday.\n\nIn addition to the scorching weather, some parts of the US are facing intense thunderstorm systems.\n\nSome 180,000 people are without power in Michigan after a storm soaked the region and downed power lines on Wednesday.\n\nThe Upper Midwest and Great Lakes are forecast to get more thunderstorms, which could bring 75-mph winds and golf-ball-sized hail, on Thursday afternoon into Friday.\n\nThose storms will then spread into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic late Friday into Saturday, the NWS predicts - bringing damaging winds, hail and possible flash flooding.", "The big claim from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is a modest one - we are no longer going into recession, and inflation will fall faster.\n\nThat is better news, relatively speaking, given the size of the shock to the economy from higher energy prices. But the big picture on living standards is that we are still in the middle of an historic fall. It is little wonder that Mr Hunt felt compelled to extend the largest part of the energy bill support that was due to run out.\n\nBut the big broad strategic decision the chancellor has made is to spend the windfall from better upfront growth in the economy to try to get the UK out of a slow growth mire.\n\nThe government has spent nearly all the extra revenue from better economic news, which means it has borrowed about \u00a320bn a year to spend on trying to boost business investment, getting people back to work and extra defence.\n\nThe plans to boost growth look like microsurgery: several dozen measures, designed to unlock two key self-admitted problems - poor business investment, and getting the workforce back up to full strength. And that surgery has a notable timing - all frontloaded to provide as big a boost possible now, before the next general election.\n\nThere are some eye-catching thrusts into a high-tech future of a dozen Canary Wharfs situated near our biggest universities. Post-Brexit changes to trading rules are focused on five key sectors. Pharmaceuticals will get the fastest regulator in the world and automatically accept medicines approved in the US, EU and Japan, building on the Covid vaccine success.\n\nBut some of the biggest measures run out just after the election, and that's why the forecasts from the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), show growth declining afterwards.\n\nSo it's maximising the bang for the buck early, trying to get a deliverable, visible, noticeable impact for voters by the time of the election, which we're expecting by late 2024.\n\nIn fact in the small print of the OBR report it says that because the changes to corporation tax are a temporary measures \"we have assumed that the Budget measure has no long run impact on the capital stock\" and \"all the additional investment is ultimately displaced from future years\".\n\nSo you get a pre-election boom in business investment and then it falls below the level that it would have done without the policy, with \"no overall impact\" on total investment.", "Peter Bol denies cheating - he and experts raise questions about the integrity of some tests\n\nWhen runner Peter Bol edged ahead of the pack during the men's 800m final at the Tokyo Olympics, it felt like the whole of Australia was cheering him on.\n\nBol - a Sudanese refugee who arrived in Australia aged eight - was the country's first finalist in the event in 53 years.\n\nDespite slipping to fourth at the final stretch, Bol's gutsy race in 2021 cemented his status as the new darling of Australian sport.\n\nHe has continued to impress - but two months ago, his momentum for the next Olympics was shattered and his life upended by what he says are untrue allegations he is a drug cheat.\n\nBut Australia's anti-doping regime has also been accused of making \"catastrophic blunders\" in its handling of his case, which experts say could have ramifications globally.\n\nIn January, Bol was informed he had failed an out-of-competition drug test and was provisionally suspended - unable to compete or train.\n\nHe had returned a positive result for the banned substance erythropoietin.\n\nBetter known as EPO, it is a naturally occurring hormone. But when injected in its synthetic form, EPO is a form of blood doping which has been employed by athletes - most famously Lance Armstrong - to aid stamina and recovery.\n\nCyclist Lance Armstrong was stripped of his titles after it emerged he had used EPO\n\nBol immediately requested a fresh analysis of his sample, a process that is supposed to be private.\n\nBut a week later - just days before he was tipped to be named Young Australian of the Year - his initial result and subsequent suspension was leaked to the media. The runner took to social media to express his \"shock\".\n\n\"It is critically important to convey with the strongest conviction I am innocent and have not taken this substance as I am accused,\" he said in a statement.\n\nA month later, on 14 February, his back-up sample returned an \"atypical response\" - meaning it was neither positive nor negative. Experts say it is rare that the two samples do not match.\n\nBol's provisional ban was lifted immediately, and the runner said he had been exonerated. \"The relief I am feeling is hard to describe\u2026 the last month has been nothing less than a nightmare,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBut Sport Integrity Australia (SIA) said he had not been cleared and vowed to continue its investigation.\n\n\"An [atypical finding] is not the same as a negative test result,\" its statement said, adding it was not possible to say when the process would conclude.\n\nBol has said he is still waiting to be interviewed by SIA officials. But last week, his team said two independent laboratories had cleared Bol of ever injecting EPO.\n\nAn expert in Canada and a team in Norway analysed the results from Bol's samples. They both found the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory (ASDTL) had erred in the way it performed the test and that it had also read the results incorrectly - mistaking naturally occurring EPO for synthetic.\n\nThey concluded Bol's initial sample should never have been deemed positive.\n\nThe ATSDL has 20 years of experience in EPO testing and is the only World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) approved facility in Australia, but Bol's lawyer Paul Greene accused it of \"inexperience and incompetence\". He demanded SIA drop its investigation and apologise for \"catastrophic blunders\".\n\nSporting Integrity Australia and the ASDTL did not answer the BBC's questions about the case.\n\nCatherine Ordway, a sports lawyer and former director at Australia's anti-doping agency, says the situation appears damning and Bol's case could have \"major ramifications for other cases around the world\".\n\nIf the lab did make mistakes during the testing process it could jeopardise its accreditation, says Dr Ordway, who notes other facilities have previously lost permits over a single false positive.\n\nBut more importantly, Bol's case has revived doubts over the test itself. A confirmed bungle could call into question EPO test results dating back decades, Dr Ordway tells the BBC.\n\n\"The World Anti-Doping Agency expert group is of course saying the test is robust\u2026 but [there have been] some serious concerns about it for quite some time,\" she says.\n\nThere are two key ways EPO testing could go wrong, exercise physiologist and biochemist Rob Robergs tells the BBC.\n\nA lot of drug tests are \"incredibly sensitive\" to small errors, the Queensland University of Technology academic says. But mistakes can also be made in the interpretation of EPO test results, as the process - unlike testing for many other banned substances - does not provide a simple yes or no answer.\n\nBecause EPO is a naturally occurring hormone, labs are trying to determine if there is any synthetic EPO.\n\n\"When they're making a judgement on that, it's subjective,\" Dr Ordway says. \"They're trying to read it and say: 'Is it outside of normal range?' But how do we determine normal range?\"\n\nSome people - often high-performance athletes - have naturally elevated hormone levels, Dr Robergs points out. Others, including Bol himself, have speculated over whether the athlete's genetic and racial background could have affected his results.\n\nIt's hard to tell if any of those factors were considered when anti-doping authorities determined the acceptable range of EPO, Dr Robergs says.\n\n\"We just don't know\u2026 there's a lack of transparency.\"\n\nBol says his training ahead of next year's Olympics has been disrupted\n\nBoth Dr Ordway and Dr Robergs say Bol's case could undermine confidence in the global anti-doping system and say Wada should review of its current EPO testing procedures.\n\nBoth independent laboratories that analysed Bol's test results also suggested the Wada method for EPO testing needs to be amended.\n\n\"We need to maintain and restore the trust in the system. Otherwise, if you lose the trust of clean athletes, then the whole system falls down,\" Dr Ordway says.\n\nBut some say the saga should also prompt authorities to consider how they treat athletes accused of doping, given the imperfect nature of the science.\n\nSIA has \"very black and white\" approach to anti-doping and are \"ruthless\" in their pursuit of perceived cheats, sports historian Stephen Townsend tells the BBC.\n\n\"This case casts doubt\u2026 on whether or not they should assume athlete guilt before they assume athlete innocence,\" says Dr Townsend, from the University of Queensland.\n\nIt's been a messy saga for both Bol and SIA, and any future resolution is unlikely to be much different, he says. \"SIA are the sports police. It's their job to protect the sanctity of sport and protect this idea of a level playing field.\n\n\"Whilst they probably recognise that they don't have much chance of pursuing Bol for a doping violation in this case, they also cannot admit that they got it wrong.\"\n\nThat leaves Bol with a cloud over his head that he admits he may never be able to shake.\n\n\"There's always going to be speculations,\" Bol said an interview with Seven last month.\n\n\"[When] I perform well, people are going to think you're on the juice. And if I don't perform well, people are going to think you got off it.\"", "A Wrexham fan from Argentina's Welsh-speaking area of Patagonia is desperate to get to the Racecourse next season.\n\nDavid Mardones has been in love with Wales' oldest football team since 2019 - before the club's Hollywood takeover by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.\n\nThe Red Dragons are soaring again after sealing promotion back to the Football League after a 15-year absence.\n\nDavid's only problem? He'll have to travel more than 7,000 miles (11,265 km) to get to a game.\n\nThe process that led to David becoming a Wrexham fan began in 1865, a year after the club was formed, when 153 Welsh pioneers set off for South America on a clipper ship called Mimosa.\n\nThe Welsh-speaking community established afterwards - Y Wladfa - has endured, with between 2,000 and 5,000 Argentines speaking Welsh to this day.\n\nDavid takes great pride in being one of them.\n\n\"My connection to Wales comes from my mother's roots, she instilled in me the Welsh traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"The language is something that I learn every day, here in Patagonia we are committed to expanding both the culture and the language and to preserve it.\n\n\"My grandparents surname was Jones.

She will be the one to continue honouring the Welsh culture in Patagonia,\" he said.\n\nThe Trevelin flag features the blue and white of Argentina's national flag and Y Ddraig Goch - the red dragon of Wales\n\nDavid was contacted by some Wrexham locals after posting pictures on a Welsh Pride Facebook group.\n\n\"One of them - who is like my brother - is Tudur Dylan Jones. Talking to him a long time ago around 2019, he told me 'I am a fan of Wrexham, you must also become a fan, the first in Patagonia',\" he said.\n\n\"I was excited about the idea and when we created the Y Wladfa Wrexham fan group, we began to have connections with many people.\n\n\"It is my dream to go to Wrexham and be at the Racecourse celebrating goals surrounded by fans.

The BRC has said there is a three- to nine-month lag to see a decrease in wholesale prices reflected in-store.\n\nIn March, the union Unite accused some retailers of \"fuelling inflation by excessive profiteering\".\n\nThe boss of Sainsbury's said the supermarket would pass on any falls in the price of goods as soon as it could and was \"absolutely determined to battle inflation for our customers\".\n\nHowever, Simon Roberts admitted widespread price falls were not likely to come soon as energy and labour costs continued to rise.\n\nVictoria Scholar, an analyst at investment firm interactive investor, said while there was \"hope\" that food prices will come down, it was \"more likely that price growth will just slow instead in the near-term as consumers continue to feel the squeeze from rising weekly food bills\".\n\n\"The unfortunate nature of the type of inflation the UK is facing is that it is affecting essential items such as food, hitting those at the lower end of the income spectrum most acutely,\" she added.\n\nWhile overall food prices continued to rise in April, the BRC said inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, both food and non-food, had fallen marginally to 8.8% in April.\n\nBut just because the inflation rate has fallen, that does not mean prices are falling, it just means that prices are not rising as quickly.\n\nThe BRC said overall price rises in the shops had slowed slightly in April because of \"heavy spring discounting in clothing, footwear, and furniture\".\n\nHow are you coping with the cost of living crisis?

This has prompted a huge response that has included the US Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, Coast Guard, Maryland authorities and specialist private firms.\n\nThe effort aims to unblock the 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep shipping channel, re-float and remove the Dali and clear whatever remains of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris from the wider Patapsco.\n\n\"Those things are happening simultaneously,\" Col Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, told the BBC. \"But the priority is for the channel, because we need to get those people back to work and help all the businesses that are affected.\"\n\nThe port is one of the busiest on the East Coast of the United States and a key regional hub for goods including steel, aluminium and agricultural equipment. It is used by car-makers including General Motors and Honda. As many as 15,000 jobs depend on it, including 8,000 directly employed there.\n\nSonar images taken by the US Navy show vast quantities of debris sitting underwater (highlighted in yellow)\n\nThe mission has turned the area into a hub of activity, buzzing with small US Navy sonar vessels and police boats, workers testing spark-emitting hydraulic shears, and - so far - seven huge crane barges, including the Chesapeake, a 1,000-tonne capacity crane once used by the CIA to build a ship used to recover a Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific.\n\nPiece by piece, debris will eventually be disassembled and lifted onto barges to be taken away.\n\n\"With every layer of debris they remove, they have to go back in and survey the wreckage to see if it reacted the way we thought it was going to,\" Col Pinchasin said. \"Are there any instabilities? Are they things we missed? What did we not see?\"\n\n\"They need to have discipline and be very self-critical.\"\n\nThe dangerous work of making these determinations has so far fallen on teams of divers who inspect both the ship and the vast, unseen debris field beneath the surface.\n\nThey are often unable to see more than a foot or two in the muddy brown waters of the Patapsco, forcing them to be guided by operators in nearby surface vessels.\n\nTheir assessments, Col Pinchasin said, are essential to ensuring that larger pieces of debris can be dismantled and removed safely.\n\n\"The pieces might be mangled, but there's a lot of force pent-up in how they're sitting right now,\" she said, gesturing at a large chunk of metal protruding from the shipping channel.\n\n\"If you were to cut one of those things, and there's tension there you don't know about and it snaps, people can be in a lot of danger,\" she added. \"We need to know what's connected, and that's why the divers have to go in. They have to feel and reach to verify\u2026 but it's like they have their eyes closed.\"\n\nA separate team of divers, drawn from the ranks of the Maryland State Police, stands ready to dive if and when investigators believe they have found the remains of the three men still missing from the collapse.\n\nThe continued search for those men, she added, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those involved in the salvage operation.\n\n\"These are families that did not get to celebrate Easter together,\" she said. \"This is very solemn ground.\"\n\nThose involved in the operation and maritime experts say that the scope of the operation has few, if any comparisons.\n\nAn initial $60m (\u00a347.4m) in emergency funds have been earmarked to cover the work. The true cost may be much higher, with one politician, Maryland Democrat David Trone, telling CBS that the cost could eventually rise to $1bn.\n\n\"The scale is the biggest challenge, but also the complexity,\" said Captain Dan Hoban, a British Royal Engineer who was on a routine exchange with the US Army Corps of Engineers when the bridge collapsed.\n\n\"It's a really messy situation. From an engineering perspective, we are trying to figure out where the cuts are going to be made and then incorporate that into a lifting plan,\" added Capt Hoban, who has been helping with the mission.\n\n\"But it needs to be safe for all those operating out there,\" he added. \"Everyone wants to get going quickly, but trying to do so safely and efficiently. We don't want to create a more difficult situation. That's the key.\"\n\nLarge crane barges are also serving as launch pads for extensive dive operations around the Dali\n\nPeter Ford, a long time merchant mariner whose firm SkyRock Advisors specialises in infrastructure projects, said that the \"intricacies\" of the Baltimore operation made it considerably more hazardous than other complex operations, such as that which freed the Ever Given, after it got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021.\n\n\"This is beyond anything we've seen,\" he said. \"It's all going to be hard. It's the mixture of the infrastructure above and below water and the fact that debris is literally draped over and balancing on the vessel.\"\n\nOnce salvage crews begin cutting larger pieces of the debris, Mr Ford predicts that the constant shifting and movement of the debris and the vessel alike can become a potentially dangerous challenge.\n\n\"God forbid that somebody miscalculates and this very sharp steel ends up cutting into a part of the ship where the bunker fuel is, or some sort of hazardous commodities on the vessel are breached and leaked into the ocean,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a game of Jenga you don't want to lose.\"\n\nWorkers plan to use specialised cutting tools and hydraulic shears to remove parts of the Key Bridge\n\nFor now, the salvage operation is still in its early stages and is largely focused on assessing the scene and the bridge, removing smaller pieces and have so far opened smaller temporary shipping channels to allow limited maritime traffic to pass through the area.\n\nBy the end of April, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to open a limited access channel 280ft (80m) wide and 35ft (10m) deep to allow one-way traffic for barge containers and some roll-on-roll-off vessels that carry cars and equipment.\n\nThe entire, permanent channel is expected to be clear and ready for use by the end of May, the \"unified command\" responsible for the operation said in a statement on 4 April.\n\nThat target date, however, may change because of the weather or unforeseen problems with the clearance operations.\n\n\"We have to go slow to go fast. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast,\" she said. \"This is a long haul.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He denies the allegations.\n\nThe alleged incidents are said to have occurred between 1982 and 2016.\n\nA dedicated phone line set up to help people contribute evidence to the review will close on Friday.\n\nBarrister Gemma White, who is leading the review, said it was set up to \"expand the ways people can come forward\" and report information.\n\nShe was appointed by the BBC Board last August after an internal review found that the corporation should have paid more attention to a string of sexual assault allegations that had been made against the former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ.\n\nThe inquiry, which has already seen more than 50,000 BBC documents, is expected to publish its findings in the summer.\n\nWhite thanked everyone who had used the phone line and said: \"We know that taking the decision to call was not easy for many of you and that speaking to us has taken courage.\n\n\"Your evidence will assist me in my task of independently establishing whether the BBC knew of concerns and responded appropriately to them.\n\n\"If you have been thinking of contributing but have not been sure about whether to do so, please do get in touch now.\"\n\nWestwood, 65, stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra in April last year and strongly denies the allegations.\n\nLast year, a statement from a representative of Westwood said: \"Tim Westwood strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\n\"In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially.", "Rain Newton-Smith took over as the CBI's new director-general last month\n\nThe CBI has hired a team of ethics advisors to help overhaul its operations, following allegations of serious sexual misconduct by staff.\n\nThe business lobby group's new head Rain Newton-Smith told members on Friday it had taken on the consultancy firm Principia Advisory.\n\nThe CBI is trying to claw back its reputation following the allegations, which include rape.\n\nBut it has already suffered an exodus of members.\n\nPrincipia Advisory bills itself as a \"leading advisor on organisational ethics\".\n\nIts website suggests that ethical crises should be dealt with using a \"whole systems' approach\" involving accountability by identifying individuals responsible, followed by \"deeper changes\".\n\nThe allegations at the CBI include claims of harassment and sexual assault including two allegations of rape, one at a summer party held by the group in 2019, another at one of its overseas offices.\n\nThe City of London Police is currently investigating the rape allegations.\n\nThe CBI has suspended day-to-day operations pending an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 6 June, at which it is expected to outline a new strategy.\n\nWhen the first allegations of harassment and sexual assault emerged in early April, the lobby group asked the law firm Fox Williams to investigate.\n\nIn response to Fox Williams' report, the CBI admitted it had hired \"culturally toxic\" staff and had failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues. That had led a \"very small minority\" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women, the group said.\n\nAn earlier report by the law firm led to the dismissal of Ms Newton-Smith's predecessor, Tony Danker. He was the subject of separate complaints of workplace misconduct, for which he has apologised.\n\nThe CBI said Ms Newton-Smith had spoken to more than 250 members and former members in an effort to shore up support.\n\nBut some of its most high profile members have deserted the organisation, including John Lewis and BMW. Others such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have suspended their engagement.\n\nThe government has also suspended any activity with the lobby group, with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt saying there was \"no point\" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted it.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The chancellor says some of the mortgage relief schemes being talked about would prolong the \"inflationary agony\".\n\nThe government has ruled out introducing major financial support to mortgage holders over fears it would drive the cost of living higher.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said offering mortgage relief schemes would \"make inflation worse, not better\".\n\nBut he said he would meet mortgage lenders later this week to ask what help they could give to households struggling with rising bills.\n\nBut the government said it was \"spending record amounts\" helping people and that it already had \"specific tools\" to provide support, citing help - in the form of a loan - for people who receive benefits.\n\nA spokesperson added households had been provided with \u00a33,300 each on average to help ease the cost of living pressures.\n\nConservative MP Sir Jake Berry asked Mr Hunt in Parliament on Tuesday to consider \"reintroducing a bold Conservative idea of mortgage interest relief at source\" to avoid what he described as a \"mortgage bomb\" happening.\n\n\"If we don't help families now all the other money we have spent helping them will be wasted if they lose their home,\" he said.\n\nBut the chancellor said the government was not considering such a move.\n\n\"Those kind of schemes, which involve injecting large amounts of cash into the economy, would be inflationary,\" he said.\"As much as we sympathise with the difficulties and do everything we can to help people seeing their mortgage costs go up, we won't do anything that would mean we prolong inflation.\"\n\nMr Hunt said he would be meeting the principal lenders to ask what help they could give to people struggling to pay more expensive mortgages and \"what flexibilities might be possible for families in arrears\".\n\nInflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, stood at 8.7% in April, meaning consumer prices overall were 8.7% higher than they were in April 2022.\n\nIn an attempt to reduce inflation, the Bank of England has been raising interest rates, making the cost of borrowing, including for a mortgage, more expensive.\n\nIt is expected that the Bank will raise rates further this week and that they will stay higher for longer.\n\nPrior to the Bank's decision, expectations of a rise has already been reflected in the funding cost of mortgages, hitting new borrowers, and people trying to remortgage.\n\nLenders have been pulling deals and putting up rates at short notice and on Monday the average rate on a two-year fixed deal rose above 6%.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also called for mortgage relief and a mortgage protection fund, but Treasury minister Andrew Griffith said such policies would delay bringing down inflation.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves asked Mr Hunt where are families \"going to get the money to pay the Tory mortgage penalty\", claiming that higher costs were a \"a consequence of the Conservative mini-budget last year and 13 years of economic failure\".", "Partygate investigator Sue Gray was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff in March this year\n\nFormer civil servant Sue Gray has chosen not to be interviewed as part of a Cabinet Office inquiry into talks with Labour about a senior party role, a minister has said.\n\nMs Gray quit the civil service after being offered a job as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff.\n\nA government appointments committee is investigating whether she breached civil service rules over the move.\n\nEarlier, Sir Keir said he was confident Ms Gray had not broken any rules.\n\nMs Gray has held some of the most senior roles in the civil service and is best known for leading an investigation into the Partygate scandal, which contributed to Boris Johnson's downfall as prime minister last year.\n\nShe ended her decades-long career with the civil service in March, as Labour announced the party had offered her one of its most senior jobs ahead of the next general election.\n\nThe Conservative government said the situation was \"unprecedented\" and ordered an internal investigation into the circumstances of her resignation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden issued a written statement to the House of Commons containing an update into the circumstances leading to Ms Gray's resignation.\n\nIn the statement, Mr Dowden said: \"Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations as part of this process but chose not to do so.\"\n\nMr Dowden added: \"I am unable at this stage to provide further information relating to the departure of Ms Gray whilst we consider next steps.\"\n\nThe internal investigation by the Cabinet Office is separate to an inquiry by the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which will provide the final judgement on Ms Gray's departure.\n\nAcoba is to recommend how long Ms Gray should wait before being allowed to take up the job with Labour.\n\nThe BBC has been told that Ms Gray's focus is on Acoba and she has \"fully cooperated\" with them and \"given them all the details requested\".\n\nDave Penman, leader of the FDA union, which represents civil servants, told Times Radio he understood why Ms Gray was prioritising Acoba rather than the Cabinet Office's internal investigation.\n\n\"Acoba is really the real deal when it comes to this and who's going to make a decision,\" Mr Penman said. \"And it really should be, because it isn't doing it for political ends.\"\n\nUnder the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.\n\nSenior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government.\n\nAcoba provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.\n\nHowever, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by its recommendations.\n\nA long delay could hamper attempts to have Ms Gray in place well before the next general election, which is widely expected next year, to help Labour prepare for government if it wins power.\n\nEarlier, Sir Keir accused the government of using the issue to try and deflect from the local election campaign, saying it should be focusing on the cost-of-living crisis instead.\n\n\"[The public are] not sitting at their breakfast talking about Sue Gray, they're talking about their bills,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMs Gray was thrust into the limelight after leading a government investigation into allegations of parties being held in Downing Street during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nShe has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team, since joining the civil service in the 1970s.\n\nMs Gray resigned from the post of second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in March, after it emerged she had been offered a job with Labour.\n\nLabour has insisted it did not approach Ms Gray until after her Partygate report was published.\n\nBut Mr Johnson and his allies have seized on Labour's job offer to claim Ms Gray's investigation when he was in power was an attempt to smear him.\n\nHer report was critical of the senior political and civil

They are OK but he feels broken.\n\nMore than 30,000 people have fled Port-au-Prince, many braving long dangerous bus journeys along gang-controlled roads to make it here. She wishes her family would do that too but she says change is hard for them - they are very reluctant to leave their home and business.\n\n\"I feel like I'm powerless because they are my parents,\" she says, exasperated. \"I cannot tell them what to do.\"\n\nNun's young life in many ways reflects the overlapping crises of her country.\n\nHer mother was killed in the 2010 earthquake which claimed more than 100,000 lives. Her cousin was killed by a gang last year, with many family members unable to attend the funeral because of the escalating violence on the streets.\n\nShe said her father did not want her to be a victim, and encouraged her to leave Port-au-Prince to pursue her ambitions.\n\n\"My neighbour in Port-au-Prince had six or seven sons, and two of them ended up in gangs. The father was a church person, a Christian. The boys used to go to church and would sing. They had bright futures, but that didn't stop them from falling into it.\"\n\nThis is a brutal reality for many children.\n\nA new UN report says more than 1,500 people have been killed by gang violence in the first three months of this year. The gangs recruit and abuse young boys and girls, the report says, sometimes killing those who try to escape.\n\n\"People ask why am I in Haiti?\" says Nun. \"Well, you either stay and you fight, or you go and have some peace.\"\n\nMany are choosing the latter.

Many are profoundly sceptical of a solution proposed by the international community.\n\nEven though the council looks to be made up of Haitian leaders, it's been created by Caricom, an intergovernmental organisation consisting of 20 nations located in the Caribbean. Many Haitians view it as \"foreign interference\".\n\nThe gangs who are currently Haiti's de facto rulers have also dismissed the council.\n\nOne of the country's most powerful gang leaders Jimmy 'Barbecue' Ch\u00e9rizier said he would consider a ceasefire: \"If the international community comes with a detailed plan, we can sit together and talk, but they do not impose on us what we should decide.\"\n\nIt will be hard though to convince many Haitians to accept violent gangsters as future political leaders.\n\nYvrose Pierre, mayor of Cap-Haitien, says gangs \"don't have any compassion\"\n\nYvrose Pierre, the first elected female mayor of Cap-Haitien, said: \"When gangs attack they are terrorising people and they don't have any compassion, they just kill. And we can't let that happen, If it's going to be someone who's going to be killed it's going to be them, not us.\"\n\nAbout five million people in Haiti - including one in two children - are on the verge of famine, according to the charity Save the Children.

Jonathan Brearley, Chief Exec of Ofgem, warns energy suppliers, 'your reputation is on the line'.\n\nTougher rules over which homes can be forcibly switched to a prepayment energy meter have been criticised by campaigners who want a total ban.\n\nCustomers must be given more chance to clear debts and forced meter fittings will be banned in homes with residents all aged over 85, regulator Ofgem said.\n\nCharities say the measures are not enough because they are voluntary, but Ofgem says they will soon be mandatory.\n\nFitting was halted after agents broke into the homes of vulnerable people.\n\nThe investigation by The Times, exposing the actions of agents for British Gas, led to a public outcry.\n\nSimon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the new rules \"do not go far enough\". Citizens Advice said they should be swiftly made mandatory.\n\nA total ban on forcible fitting would need to be introduced by government ministers.\n\nEnergy Secretary Grant Shapps appeared to confirm the government would take action. Asked as he left Downing Street whether more would be done to control pre-payment meters, Mr Shapps said: \"Yeah, we'll be on this.\"\n\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the regulator needed to balance managing debt, while also protecting vulnerable customers. However, he said firms' reputations were on the line if they failed to follow the rules.\n\n\"We cannot look at everything that suppliers do, so we cannot guarantee there will be no bad practice out there. But we have the ability to go deep into a company to see what is happening,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nTarique Chowdhury says suppliers could have done more\n\nQuestions have been raised about energy firms marking their own performance, but they will need to satisfy five conditions before they can resume force-fitting of meters from May. In practice, it could be months before some companies are able to start forcible installations again.\n\nOfgem said it would be turning the code into new mandatory rules, and would strengthen them if required.\n\nMr Brearley said there would be \"much tighter\" monitoring of the new rules. He said that if companies failed to adhere to the requirements then tighter regulations would be introduced that would be \"against their commercial interests\".\n\nHe said the regulator could call in information from smart meters and bodycam evidence to check companies' performance.\n\nThe plans are insufficient, according to Tarique Chowdhury, 55, who had a prepayment meter force-fitted in the autumn of 2020 after a previous tenant had built up debts.\n\nHe said that the \"conveyor belt\" approach to fittings had been wrong, and its forced nature \"felt like being burgled\". The new code, he said, lacked teeth.\n\n\"A loss of reputation is a risk these companies can take,\" he said, claiming that the companies could have spent money on proper checks.\n\nSwitching people onto prepayment meters without their consent has become more common since energy prices went up.\n\nIt can be done by warrant or remotely via smart meters, with suppliers saying it may help indebted customers manage their spending.\n\nBut campaigners say prepayment meters - which must be topped up - leave vulnerable customers at risk of running out of credit and losing access to light and heat.\n\nAll energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales have signed up to the code of conduct which sets out the practices they should adhere to when fitting the meters.\n\nUnder the rules, suppliers will now have to make at least 10 attempts to contact a customer and conduct a \"site welfare visit\" before a prepayment meter is installed.\n\nRepresentatives fitting them will also have to wear body cameras or audio equipment to make sure the rules are followed.\n\nIf a customer has repaid what they owed, then their case can be reassessed and they may be able to move back off a prepayment meter.\n\nHowever, there are concerns the rules will only protect the highest risk individuals.\n\nFor vulnerable customers in a \"medium risk\" category, suppliers will be required to carry out further risk assessments but can still go ahead with forced installations if they consider them justified.\n\nMedium risk individuals could include elderly people aged between 75 and 84, parents of children under five years old, pregnant women and people with Alzheimer's disease among other conditions.\n\n\"What about elderly people below the age of 85? Also some disabled people could still miss out - people using power to charge their wheelchairs, for example. There will be people who aren't covered,\" said Mr Francis of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition.\n\nDisability equality charity Scope is calling for an outright ban, warning the rules mean some disabled households could still have meters force-fitted.\n\nAn estimated 600,000 people were forced to switch to prepayment meters after struggling to pay their bills last year, up from 380,000 in 2021, according to Citizens Advice.\n\nEven before force-fitting of meters could resume, companies should be satisfied they pass tests including an audit to uncover any wrongfully installed meters. Also, they must deal with any historical issues over meter fitting outlined by the regulator.\n\nDavid Ford had debt agents arrive at his home in Brighton threatening to use a locksmith to break in and install a prepayment meter, which was later fitted.\n\nHe said that improvements should have been made to the system years ago, by the regulator and government.\n\n\"When this gets done it can leave you in a worse position,\" said Mr Ford, who - like his partner - has disabilities.\n\nSuppliers have previously pointed out that if customer debts go unpaid, they will have to be covered eventually through everyone else's bill.\n\nHave you had a prepayment meter forcibly installed?

Regular pay fell by 0.8% after the effect of inflation was taken into account.\n\nThe latest wage figures were higher than expected and Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said this \"won't ease the Bank of England's inflation fears significantly\".\n\nLast month, the Bank of England raised interest rates by more than expected, lifting its key rate to 5% from 4.5%.\n\nMr Webb said that while he expected the Bank to push rates to 5.25% at its next meeting in August, he added \"we can't rule out\" an increase to 5.5%, saying \"much will depend\" on next week's inflation figure.\n\nDeutsche Bank said that an increase in rates to 5.5% next month \"now looks more likely than not\".\n\nForecasts of more rate rises by the Bank have helped to push mortgage costs to their highest level for 15 years.\n\nIn January, when the UK's inflation rate was above 10%, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to halve it by the end of the year.\n\nMel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told the BBC's Today programme that while forecasts still suggest that would happen, \"it is not going to be easy\".\n\nThe figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also showed:\n\nThere are indications that what is called \"tightness\" in the labour market - where there are too few workers to fit the jobs available - is starting to ease.\n\nHowever, business groups have continued to stress the difficulty of finding the right workers, despite the slight rise in unemployment and fewer vacancies.\n\nThe government is now offering all workers a \"Midlife MOT\" on their careers to help those in their mid-40s and above to retrain.\n\nThe ONS data showed that pay rises were highest for those in better paid sectors such as finance, and were lower in retail.\n\nThe most up-to-date figures for just the month of May seem to show wage rises beginning to slow. This raises the possibility that pay increases have now peaked, which could lead to a calmer path for inflation.\n\nKitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that while wage costs remain \"very acute\" for companies there were some \"hopeful signs\" in the latest ONS figures, \"with the number of vacancies falling and more people coming out of inactivity back into the labour market\".\n\nThe Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \"Our jobs market is strong with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around one million job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further.\"\n\nLabour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were \"another dismal reflection of the Tories' mismanagement of the economy\".\n\n\"Britain is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic and real wages have fallen yet again,\" he added.", "Plans for the NFT for Britain were launched when Rishi Sunak was chancellor\n\nPlans for a government backed non-fungible token (NFT) produced by the Royal Mint have been dropped, the Treasury has announced.\n\nRishi Sunak ordered the creation of a \"NFT for Britain\" that could be traded online, while chancellor in April 2022.\n\nNFTs are assets in the digital world that can be bought and sold, but which have no physical form of their own.\n\nThe Royal Mint announced it was \"not proceeding with the launch\" following a consultation with the Treasury.\n\nEconomic Secretary Andrew Griffiths said the department would keep the proposal \"under review\".\n\nNFTs have been touted as the digital answer to collectables, but some sceptics fear they could be a bubble waiting to burst. They have been used as speculative assets and some have sold for millions of dollars.\n\nResponding to the announcement, Harriet Baldwin, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, said: \"We have not yet seen a lot of evidence that our constituents should be putting their money in these speculative tokens unless they are prepared to lose all their money.\n\n\"So perhaps that is why the Royal Mint has made this decision in conjunction with the Treasury.\"\n\nNFTs are unique units of digital data that use the same \"blockchain\" technology behind cryptocurrencies - such as Bitcoin. The records cannot be forged because the blockchain ledger is maintained by thousands of computers around the world.\n\nThe digital tokens, which emerged in 2014, can be thought of as certificates of ownership for virtual or physical assets, and can be bought using traditional currency or cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Treasury is working to regulate some cryptocurrencies and had planned to enter the NFT market as part of a wider bid to make the UK a hub for digital payment companies.\n\nIn April 2022, the then-chancellor Mr Sunak said: \"We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.\"\n\nAmong the best-known NFTs are a series known as the \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\", which give the bearer ownership over a unique picture of a cartoon ape.

I cannot provide exact details.\"\n\nBut travellers are not in danger, he continued. \"We do not consider this a public safety matter.\"\n\nThe Toronto Sun reported earlier on Thursday that police thought organised crime groups were involved. Mr Duivesteyn said it was too early to tell.\n\n\"We're three days in, so our investigators have their eyes open to all avenues,\" he said. \"We're kind of keeping a broad outlook on it, so we're looking on all angles on how this item was stolen.\"\n\nIn a statement, the airport said that thieves did not gain access to the airport itself but \"accessed the public side of a warehouse that is leased to a third party, outside of our primary security line\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for comment.", "Tanks hit by Russian mines are either being quickly repaired or scavenged for parts\n\nThe general in charge of Ukraine's stuttering counter-offensive in the south has said Russian defences are making it difficult for military equipment, including Western tanks and armoured vehicles, to move forward.\n\nGen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi says his forces are struggling to overcome multi-layered minefields and fortified defensive lines.\n\n\"That is why most of the tasks have to be performed by troops.\"\n\nHe says Russia's military has displayed \"professional qualities\" by preventing Ukrainian forces from \"advancing quickly\".\n\nLatest unconfirmed reports from the US suggest the main thrust of the counter-offensive has begun. The Institute for the Study of War says Ukrainian forces appear to have broken through \"certain pre-prepared Russian defensive positions\".\n\nBut so far there's little evidence that Western supplied tanks and armoured vehicles have been able to tip the balance decisively in Ukraine's favour.\n\nSeveral Leopard tanks and US Bradley fighting vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the first days of the offensive, near the city of Orikhiv.\n\nUkraine's 47th Brigade, which had largely been trained and equipped by the West to try to break through Russian lines, were soon stopped in their tracks by mines and then targeted by artillery.\n\nRussia released multiple videos of the incident claiming Ukraine's offensive had already failed. In reality it was an early setback rather than a decisive blow.\n\nRussia released footage of tanks it said it had destroyed in the early days of the offensive\n\nWe visited the same brigade's outdoor workshop, hidden in a forest behind the front line, where they are now trying to repair more than a dozen armoured vehicles - most of them US Bradleys.\n\nThey first arrived unscathed but now bear the scars of battle. Broken tracks and buckled wheels - the tell-tale signs that several have hit Russian mines.\n\nSerhii, one of the engineers, says: \"The faster we can repair them, the faster we can get them back to the front line to save someone's life.\"\n\nBut he also admits that some are beyond repair and will have to be either scavenged for spare parts or \"returned to our partners\" to be rebuilt.\n\nWhile Western armour has provided Ukrainian troops with better protection, it has not been able to punch through the rows of Russian mines - one of the biggest barriers for Ukraine's advance.\n\nTravelling the southern front we also saw British supplied Mastiff armoured vehicles damaged and destroyed.\n\nMaksym, a tank commander near the front line, says Russian lines are defended by rows of minefields\n\nThe 47th Brigade is now using some of its older, Soviet-era tanks to clear minefields. But they too can't escape the explosives hidden in the ground, even when fitted with specialist mine-clearing equipment.\n\nNearer the front line, tank commander Maksym showed us his recently-damaged T-64 tank. It's been fitted with two rollers on the front to deliberately set off the mines. He lost one of the rollers the night before as he was trying to clear a path for troops.\n\n\"Normally our rollers can withstand up to four explosions,\" he says. But the Russians, he adds, have been laying mines on top of each other to destroy their mine clearing equipment.\n\n\"It's very hard because there are too many mines,\" Maksym says, adding that there were often more than four rows of minefields in front of the Russian defensive lines.\n\nIt's been painful to watch the battle unfold for Doc and his drone reconnaissance team from Ukraine's Volunteer Army.\n\nUkrainian drone pilot Doc says Russia is increasingly using remote-controlled mines to slow them down\n\nDoc, his call sign, took part in last year's successful offensive on Kherson. But he says this time it's proving to be much tougher. For the first time in the war, he says, soldiers are being injured by mines more than artillery: \"When we go forward we meet minefields everywhere.\"\n\nDoc shows me a video he recently filmed from one of his drones while Ukrainian troops advanced towards a Russian trench.\n\nThere's a massive explosion as soon as the soldiers enter. The trench was empty but rigged with mines. Doc says Russian forces are now using remotely controlled mines. \"When our soldiers get to the trenches they push a button and it blows up, killing our friends.\" He says he's seen the tactic being used over the past two weeks and calls it \"a new weapon\".\n\nThere is a military logic to Ukraine's offensive in the south. It's seen as key to dividing Russian forces and reaching the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol - all the way to Crimea. But the focus on this axis means that Ukraine is also now attacking Russian defensive lines where they're strongest.\n\nSlow or not, the offensive is taking place and it will definitely reach its goal\n\nGen Tarnavskiy said his forces were doing \"hard and painstaking work\". He said \"any defence can be broken but you need patience time and skilful actions\".\n\nUkraine was slowly wearing down their enemy, he said. Russia didn't care about losing men, and recent changes in their military leadership \"means everything is not OK\", he added. He insisted that Ukraine had yet to commit its main strike force.\n\n\"Slow or not, the offensive is taking place and it will definitely reach its goal,\" he says.\n\nI ask Gen Tarnavsky how we can judge whether it's a success or a failure?\n\nHe smiles and replies: \"If the offensive were not successful, I wouldn't be talking to you now.\"", "Patients in Sudan are trapped in hospitals without electricity and water, the BBC has been told, while others needing medical care are being evacuated, as fighting continues for a third day.\n\n\"I thought we were going to die on the street,\" exclaims Faheem after being evacuated from a hospital with his 14-year-old daughter, Amal.\n\n\"Amal had to undergo a critical operation for a tumour in her head, following complications from previous surgeries. But we had to keep moving rooms because of the shelling. We eventually reached the ground floor. But then we were told to leave and search for a safe area.\"\n\nAlmost 100 people have died since the violence broke out on Saturday.\n\nIt follows a rift between two men, vying for control: the head of the army and in effect the country's president and his deputy, the leader of the formidable paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\n\"I carried Amal as buildings around us were being bombarded. She was feeling very unwell and was being sick,\" Faheem explains.\n\nThe father and daughter managed to safely flee the area. Faheem told the BBC that she is doing well and they hope to return to see a doctor in a couple of weeks for a follow up visit, if possible.\n\nWhile some people are being evacuated, others have been trapped in hospitals around the country for days on end.\n\nA satellite image from 16 April reveal fires burning near a hospital in Khartoum, Sudan\n\nWorkers and volunteers have told the BBC they have endured days living under \"immense psychological strain due to shortages of food and drink\", as well as dealing with the fear of the ongoing indiscriminate shelling in the surrounding areas.\n\n\"We heard the sounds of bombardments and gunshots,\" Ashraf, who is accompanying his injured relative to a Sudanese hospital tells the BBC.\n\n\"The hospital is facing a critical issue, with no water and electricity, which puts the patients' lives at risk,\" Ashraf warns.\n\nA doctor we spoke to, who has been stuck at the same hospital for three days, confirmed the worsening conditions.\n\n\"The hospital is confronted with a pressing challenge: the disruption of water and electricity supply, which is putting the remaining patients in a precarious position.\"\n\nHe says even though the hospital has received food aid he is worried about what will happen if the building is hit.\n\n\"They are trying to evacuate the hospital at the moment, in coordination with the concerned authorities but there is an absence of a proper evacuation plan, which is causing further concerns, as the hospital is situated in a high-risk area, vulnerable to potential attacks,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMany hospitals in close proximity to the army headquarters in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, have been the hardest hit.\n\nBombings have resulted in severe damage to some places such as the Al-Shaab Hospital, where an ambulance driver and three others were injured.\n\nFour other hospitals were also affected, with some being rendered completely out of service, while one police hospital has been entirely emptied out and reportedly taken over by the RSF.\n\nAcross social media, videos verified by the BBC show people evacuating one hospital, as gunshots ring out in the background. At another, a health worker can be seen trying to reassure patients about oxygen supplies running low, as a woman can be heard shouting for assistance in the background.\n\nIn another video sent directly to the BBC women can be seen sheltering in the basement of a hospital in darkness, while they prepare the evening meal to break the fast.\n\nThe Sudan doctors' union issued an urgent statement calling for the protection of health facilities as well as allowing safe passage for ambulances.\n\nIt described bombings as a clear violation of international humanitarian law and called on the international community to help.\n\n*The names of the interviewees have been changed to protect their safety.", "Local Hero was released in 1983 and is recognised as a classic\n\nIt is the story of a US petro-chemical giant seeking to build a refinery in a coastal village whose staff are won over by the gentler rhythms of local life.\n\nThe 1983 Bill Forsyth movie Local Hero was set in Scotland, but had a universal story which won over film fans around the world.\n\nIt also brought fame to a red phone box in the Aberdeenshire village of Pennan, which played a key role in the film.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of its UK release, its stars and local people have been speaking about the film's importance.\n\nOne of the central characters is Mac MacIntyre, played by Peter Riegert.\n\nIn the film he updates his boss in America each night from the traditional red phone kiosk on the seafront. Pennan features as the fictional village of Ferness.\n\nSpeaking from his home in New York, Mr Riegert, now, 76, said the best part of being involved in Local Hero was that it was still \"so fondly appreciated\" 40 years on.\n\n\"Whenever I say yes to something I'm not saying yes because it's going to be a classic, because no-one knows,\" he told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"But it was really clear to me when we were making it that this was as good as it gets.\n\n\"It may just be the best-written screenplay I've ever read. Everything came off the page. The script was so magical. Local Hero was filled with whimsy metaphor - everything about it was right in my wheelhouse.\"\n\nHe described the film's setting as \"a magical place\".\n\n\"I realised that my job was to leave home thinking I was one person and I was going to be leaving Scotland knowing I was another person.\n\n\"There were two events that were going to influence me. One was the physical location and the other was the people.\n\n\"The light on the beach during the magic hour, I'd never seen anything like it. It was spectacular.\n\nPennan - with the phone box visible - is nestled at the foot of cliffs on the Aberdeenshire coast\n\n\"And that was every day we were shooting there. The sunset seemed to be changing colours - it wasn't the Northern Lights - but it was whatever that was, and to see it every night.\n\n\"I didn't have to act. I was just there being in awe.\"\n\nHe recalled a memorable telephone scene from the film.\n\n\"We were shooting that scene at midnight,\" he said.\n\n\"I was under the impression that if I had some brandy or whisky, I would stay warm. But it has the opposite effect. By the time we were finished shooting, I was so drunk.\n\n\"I went to Bill (Forsyth, the director) the next day and said I'm so sorry. And he said: 'For what?' I said: 'Oh my God I was so drunk' and he said: 'Yeah, it was very believable'.\"\n\nMr Riegert added: \"I love that the movie still means so much to people. It's very thrilling to have it so well thought of.\"\n\nBill Pitt, 63, is originally from Charlestown, South Carolina, but now runs self catering cottages overlooking Pennan.\n\nHe paints and maintains the phone box with the help of Eddie Hayes.\n\n\"I think it's very important,\" Mr Pitt said.\n\n\"It brings people in. It's a big economic driver for the area. The phone box means a lot to people and we take it seriously that we want to keep it looking nice. It's a reflection of the community, on Pennan and the wider area.\n\n\"We just enjoy coming down here and painting it to make it look good. It's appreciated by locals, it's appreciated by visitors that come to the area.\"\n\nAsked if he felt like a Mac Macintyre character himself, he said: \"My wife and I moved over in 2006 and a little bit of it really had to do with the phone box and the film Local Hero.\n\n\"When we go back home to South Carolina, our heart is still here. Similar to what Mac did going back to Houston. And I think Pennan and the north east has that feeling for many people.\"\n\nMr Hayes added: \"People enjoy coming and making a call from the Local Hero phone box. It makes their holiday.\"\n\n\"You just try to do the best job you can and hope it will be well received,\" the 75-year-old said.\n\n\"It's such a satisfying feeling that Local Hero has had such longevity. It's so popular in the States and has this extraordinary shelf life.\"\n\nLawson said the role was \"right up there\" alongside the highlights of his 50-year career.\n\n\"I am very proud of the movie, he was a great character to play,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a movie set in Scotland but it had a universal story. It could have been anywhere in the world.\"\n\nAsked if he had a message for the film's fans, he said: \"It's very moving, it's very touching, that people still have this connection with the film after 40 years and want to celebrate that.\n\nOver the next month local events and screenings are being held to celebrate the anniversary of the film, which also starred Burt Lancaster, Peter Capaldi and Fulton Mackay.\n\nShona Stephen runs the Coastal Cuppie at Pennan Harbour, keeping locals and tourists refreshed.\n\nShe hopes the film's legacy lives on.\n\n\"It takes in so many tourists who just love the film,\" she said. \"There's a real cult following I would say for Local Hero.\n\n\"For the amount of people who come and for the size of Pennan, for the iconic phone box, it's absolutely amazing.\n\n\"I meet a lot of people who have come especially to Pennan to see the telephone box - from Australia, America, New Zealand, France, Germany.\n\n\"I think we're very keen to keep it going because it's so iconic.

On Tuesday, SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was also arrested in relation to the same investigation. Both men were released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nMs Forbes - who came second in the leadership contest behind Humza Yousaf - was speaking to the Radio 4 programme - Leading Scotland Where? which airs on Wednesday at 20:30 BST.\n\nIt is her first broadcast interview since the contest and was recorded after Mr Murrell's arrest but before Mr Beattie's.\n\nMs Forbes told the programme: \"I think we need decisive action or we will be in trouble.\n\n\"People are watching with astonishment but they want to see the leadership dealing with it and resolving it.\"\n\nShe added: \"Right now with questions over integrity, trust, transparency - I think voters are watching extremely carefully.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the next general election - expected to take place in 2024 - she said people would vote on \"the basis of how we have sorted out our internal problems - even more than that how we govern\".\n\n\"There is still time to sort it out.

Kate Forbes, Ash Regan and Humza Yousaf will answer audience questions in Edinburgh, in a race which has exposed old divisions.\n\nIt was an occasion of real political drama, a moment when it seemed the Scottish National Party might tear itself apart.\n\n\"Those of us who put Scotland and the party above narrow personal or political obsessions cannot and will not tolerate behaviour which is divisive and harmful,\" thundered the SNP leader in a fiery speech.\n\nImmediately, a group of rebel SNP members strode out of the hall in protest; raucous jeers, cheers and applause ringing in their ears.\n\nThis is not a description of the latest leadership hustings but of the SNP's 1982 conference in Ayr.\n\nThe leader was Gordon Wilson; the rebels subsequently expelled from the party included a young Alex Salmond; and their demand was for the SNP to embrace a vision of Scotland as a socialist republic.\n\nNow, four decades later, old fissures are opening up again, with heated debate about the party's direction of travel on economics, independence and social issues.\n\nAll this is unfolding in a very different political landscape.\n\nHaving run Scotland's devolved government since 2007, the SNP of today is vastly bigger, slicker, and more successful than it was when it had only two MPs in the early '80s.\n\nThe group of rebel SNP members strode out of the party's 1982 conference in Ayr\n\nA new generation of nationalist politicians - Kate Forbes, Ash Regan and Humza Yousaf - are not only competing for the party crown, but also to become the sixth first minister of Scotland since powers over health, education and other domestic issues were devolved from London to Edinburgh in 1999.\n\nNeither Ms Forbes nor Mr Yousaf were born at the time of the Ayr affair. Ms Regan was at primary school.\n\nFor much of their adult lives, their party has been known for its extraordinary public unity and iron political discipline, first under Mr Salmond and then, following Scotland's rejection of independence in the 2014 referendum, under Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nBut trouble was brewing well before Ms Sturgeon announced her shock resignation last month, triggering the leadership contest.\n\nHer ministry had been under pressure on economics from both left and right; on independence from frustrated members of both the SNP and Mr Salmond's breakaway Alba Party; and on gender reform from critics led by the Harry Potter author JK Rowling.\n\nThe SNP has been known for its public unity and political discipline\n\nFirst, the economics. Since bringing the Scottish Green Party into government two years ago to support her minority administration, the first minister had been accused of indulging an anti-growth agenda.\n\nThis was allegedly exemplified by her rejection of new drilling for oil and gas, the imposition on business of an unpopular bottle recycling scheme, and plans to curb alcohol advertising.\n\nDespite raising taxes on the richest Scots, the SNP leader was also accused by the left of cosying up to capitalists.\n\nJonathon Shafi, the author of a pro-independence newsletter called Independence Captured, argues that the SNP has been \"captured by corporate lobbyists\".\n\nHe accuses the Scottish government of embracing neoliberal economic policies which prioritise capital over labour by, for example, flogging off national green energy resources on the cheap, and forming an alliance with the Conservatives to create freeports, which he derides as \"tax havens\".\n\nMs Sturgeon rejects such criticism but economic issues have been a key part of the campaign so far.\n\nA special edition of the Debate Night programme will air at 20:00 on BBC One Scotland. The candidates will face questions from an audience of voters from across the political spectrum in Edinburgh.\n\nThe debate, hosted Stephen Jardine, will also be streamed live on the BBC News website and on BBC iPlayer.\n\nKate Forbes, currently on maternity leave from her role as finance secretary, is often described as the most business-friendly contender, although she stresses that she champions growth for a purpose: to secure independence and end poverty.\n\nMs Forbes has described the bottle return scheme as having the potential to cause \"economic carnage\". She argues that after Covid, Brexit, and energy price hikes, firms should be given \"a bit of breathing space\".\n\nMr Yousaf and Ms Regan have also expressed reservations about the scheme, and all three candidates have raised concerns about the potential impact of a proposed advertising ban on Scotland's \u00a35.5bn whisky industry.\n\nIf either Ms Forbes or Ms Regan is victorious, the power-sharing deal with the Greens would appear to be in jeopardy while Mr Yousaf is generally seen as the continuity candidate, a position which has opened him up to the kind of attacks rarely seen since the intra-party warfare of the 1980s.\n\nWhen Ms Forbes used a debate televised by STV to trash Mr Yousaf's record as transport minister, justice secretary and health secretary, it felt like a lid had blown off a simmering pot.\n\n\"More of the same is not a manifesto,\" said Ms Forbes, \"it's an acceptance of mediocrity.\"\n\nIn the next debate, hosted by Channel 4 News, Mr Yousaf hit back, accusing his rival of being the Conservatives' favoured candidate.\n\nThe Scottish Tories, he claimed, were \"rooting for you to win\".\n\nLabour senses an opportunity here, both for Sir Keir Starmer's attempts to win the keys to 10 Downing Street in London and for Anas Sarwar's ambition to one day move into the first minister's official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh.\n\nIn Monday's Sky News debate all three candidates said that in the event of a hung parliament at Westminster they would, in theory, prop up a minority Labour government in return for the formal transfer to Holyrood of the power to hold a second referendum on independence, a deal which Sir Keir has repeatedly insisted he would not strike under any circumstances.\n\nAnd in an attempt to win back voters Labour have lost to the SNP, the party's sole MP in Scotland, Ian Murray, who represents Edinburgh South, has resurrected the old \"Tartan Tory\" label which was often applied to the SNP under Gordon Wilson.\n\nSir Keir Starmer with Anas Sarwar on a visit to Glasgow last week\n\nHe has accused Ms Forbes of right-wing economics, even though her plan to grow the economy to invest in public services has distinct echoes of New Labour.\n\nWhat, though, of the national question? Here too there is division and discord, as well as potential opportunity.\n\n\"As Albert Camus said: 'Freedom is nothing but a chance to do better',\" said Steve Norris, convener of the SNP's Kirkcudbright and District branch in the south west of Scotland.\n\nHe regards this leadership election as probably the most important in the party's history.\n\nHe is impressed with Ms Forbes, describing her as \"honest, straight, true and brimful of integrity\".\n\nMr Norris is also complimentary about Ms Regan, saying: \"She's got her own ideas about how we achieve our march towards independence and that has attracted a lot of members...to her side.\"\n\nSteve Norris is convener of the SNP's Kirkcudbright and District branch\n\nCrucially, those ideas do not involve holding another referendum on leaving the UK.\n\nInstead Ms Regan would treat all future Westminster and Holyrood elections as referendums in all but name. If at any point pro-independence parties polled more than 50% of the vote, Ms Regan says this would constitute a mandate to open negotiations with London.\n\n\"The ballot box is the gold standard of democracy,\" she says - insisting that if the UK government at first refused to enter talks, international outrage would force it to climb down, a claim rejected by both Labour and the Tories.\n\nIn the meantime, the MSP for Edinburgh Eastern says that as first minister she would focus on running the Scottish government, with work on preparing for secession devolved to an Independence Convention and an Independence Commission.\n\nAt a hustings in Fife, Ms Regan suggested that voters could be alerted to the moment \"we've solved\" all of the problems standing in the way of independence by means of a public installation in Glasgow or Edinburgh to be known as a Readiness Thermometer.\n\nThe current temperature of the thermometer is unclear, although by Ms Regan's own logic it is presumably not yet hot enough for independence.\n\nAsh Regan resigned as community safety minister over the gender reforms\n\nMs Forbes' approach to the issue is at once fast and slow.\n\nFast because she has pledged to, somehow, obtain the power from Westminster to hold a referendum within three months of winning a majority at the next Westminster election.\n\nSlow because she says independence will only be secured by winning over undecided voters through a strategy of patient competence.\n\n\"We maximise that support through good governance; a growing, thriving economy; a mission to eradicate poverty; and demonstrating that Scotland's better days are ahead with independence,\" says the MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.\n\nMr Yousaf's message is not dissimilar. \"Don't get bogged down in process,\" he argues. Focus on making the case for independence, and the path will become clear.\n\nHe has distanced himself from the controversial policy, which appears to have contributed to Ms Sturgeon's downfall, of turning the next general election into a de facto referendum on independence, stating over and over that he's \"not wedded to it\".\n\nHumza Yousaf has been portrayed as the continuity candidate\n\nThe MSP for Glasgow Pollok is dismissive of the notion that Westminster would agree to begin independence negotiations in the event of pro-independence parties winning more than 50% of the vote in a general election.\n\n\"When we need to get them on a phone call they don't even bloody come on the phone, right, let alone telling them to come up the road and demanding that they take part in negotiations,\" he said.\n\nMr Yousaf has a similarly blunt assessment of Westminster on the other big issue which has split the SNP - gender.\n\n\"There's a fundamental principle here about our democracy which is under attack,\" he told me on the day of his campaign launch.\n\nTo recap, briefly: in December, after a lengthy and fractious process, the Scottish Parliament approved legislation which would have lowered from 18 to 16 the age at which someone could change the sex on their birth certificate, as well as removing medical and administrative hurdles to doing so.\n\nMs Regan had resigned on principle as community safety minister rather than vote for the law, which she opposed.\n\nKate Forbes said she would have voted against gay marriage\n\nThen, arguing that the Scottish bill contravened Britain's Equality Act by making it harder to exclude people born biologically male from women-only spaces, the UK government took the unprecedented step of blocking it from receiving royal assent.\n\nMs Forbes - who told me that she too would have voted against the law, had she not been on maternity leave at the time - said she was \"loath\" to challenge Rishi Sunak's government on the matter in court, instead suggesting that the conflict could be solved by Holyrood amending the legislation.\n\nMs Regan is not convinced that is possible. She proposes dropping the bill and sending the issue of gender to a citizens' assembly for consideration.\n\nMr Yousaf diverges dramatically from the other two candidates on this point though, insisting it is vital to take the case to court.\n\n\"There's a fundamental principle here about our democracy which is under attack,\" he told me. This argument is rejected by the UK government, which insists it is acting entirely properly within the structures of the Scotland Act which established devolution.\n\nThis is not the only social issue roiling the campaign.\n\nMs Forbes, a member of the Calvinist Free Church of Scotland, has attracted strong criticism for saying she would have voted against gay marriage had she been a politician at the time it became law in 2014.\n\nHer stance has also attracted some praise.\n\n\"I actually really commend her for her honesty,\" says Alec Ross, an SNP member who owns an agricultural business in Stranraer.\n\nMr Yousaf, who is a Muslim, has denied that he dodged the final vote on the subject in 2014 for religious reasons.\n\nDespite Kate Forbes insisting that she would defend the hard-won rights of any minority, including gay people, a slew of SNP parliamentarians deserted her campaign, leaving Mr Yousaf heavily favoured by the party establishment, including the key figure of Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\n\nThis has led supporters of the two women in the race to cry foul, claiming that the hierarchy is doing all it can to stitch up the contest for Mr Yousaf.\n\nThey point to the case of South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper, who broke the rules by using her party email address to campaign for the health secretary.\n\nM\u00e0iri McAllan, the environment, biodiversity and land reform minister who is often tipped as a future SNP leader herself, and who is backing Mr Yousaf, denies any foul play, pointing out that Ms Harper's email privileges were suspended as a result.\n\n\"I think the fact that the parliamentary group has largely supported Humza is much more about his record and what his vision is for the party and for Scotland than anything to do with any conspiracies,\" she told me.\n\nTo distinguish the party from Labour and the Conservatives, she adds: \"It's more important than ever that the SNP is that centre-left, socially democratic progressive party.\"\n\nForty-one years after the stushie in Ayr the battle continues to rage for the SNP's cultural, political, and economic soul.", "Prince Harry is claiming up to \u00a3440,000 in damages for newspaper articles published by Mirror Group Newspapers which he alleges breached his privacy.\n\nAmounts being claimed were released on the final day of the trial examining allegations of phone hacking.\n\nThe case has been brought by Prince Harry and three others.\n\nPrince Harry's lawyers have highlighted 33 stories in their claim, including reports about his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy and his drug taking.\n\nThe duke's lawyers initially suggested he could be awarded up to \u00a3320,000 if his case is successful in relation to the 33 stories.\n\nIn a document released later, they said he is also seeking further damages of about \u00a3120,000.

Hungarian leader Viktor Orban and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were among the few figures from the world stage.\n\n\"To be happy means to love parties, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to have a sense of humour,\" said Archbishop Mario Delpini in a homily that encapsulated the four-time prime minister's flamboyant life.\n\nBerlusconi was a divisive figure for Italians, and renowned abroad for his crude jokes and so-called bunga-bunga parties.\n\nIn the front row of the cathedral were his five children, who have been catapulted into the limelight, as part of an inevitable succession story.\n\nBerlusconi's coffin left the cathedral flanked by Carabinieri police in plumed helmets\n\nDuring his lifetime, Berlusconi amassed a vast empire that spanned media, real estate, finance, cinema and sport - as well as a powerful political party that is part of Italy's current government.\n\nHe was one of Italy's richest men. According to Forbes, his business assets are worth about \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.15bn).\n\nBut he never publicly indicated who should lead his business empire after his death and there are also big questions over the future of the Forza Italia party he created.\n\nBerlusconi has two children from his first marriage and three from his second. All of them have stakes in Fininvest, his holding company.\n\nThe future of his business interests will likely depend on how he has chosen to distribute the 61% stake he had in Fininvest.\n\nWill there be equal shares for all, or more for the two eldest children, Marina and Pier Silvio, who have held management roles in the empire since the early 1990s?\n\nThis 1993 picture shows Silvio Berlusconi with his wife Veronica and their 3 children, Luigi, Eleonora and Barbara\n\nOther valuable assets are undoubtedly Berlusconi's numerous luxurious villas. They could be tricky to pass on to his offspring in an equal way.\n\nHis Villa San Martino in Arcore, north-east of Milan, covers 3,500 sq m and dates back to the 18th Century. He also has homes at Lake Maggiore, in Rome, Cannes, the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n\nThe jewel in Berlusconi's crown of properties is Villa Certosa, a mansion in Sardinia that he bought in the 1970s.\n\nHe hosted world leaders there, from Vladimir Putin to George W. Bush. It has 126 rooms and looks like a theme park - including a fake volcano that erupts lava.

Watch: Uproar on the streets of Paris and jeers in parliament over retirement age increase\n\nPolice in Paris have clashed with protesters after the French government decided to force through pension reforms without a vote in parliament.\n\nCrowds converged on Place de la Concorde in response to raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nThe plans had sparked two months of heated political debate and strikes.\n\nFinally, Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne invoked article 49:3 of the constitution - allowing the government to avoid a vote in the Assembly.\n\nThe decision was taken minutes before MPs were scheduled to vote on the controversial bill, because there was no guarantee of winning a majority.\n\nThe move caused fury among opposition politicians. Many jeered the prime minister, sang La Marseillaise and held up signs of protest in parliament.\n\nA no-confidence motion was filed against President Emmanuel Macron's government on Friday by a group of opposition parties.\n\nLeader of left-wing party La France Insoumise (LFI), Mathilde Panot, tweeted that Mr Macron had plunged the country into a government crisis, without parliamentary or popular legitimacy.\n\nThousands of people came out on the streets of Paris and other French cities to reject the move, singing the national anthem and waving trade union flags.\n\nSome protesters clashed with police as evening fell. A fire was lit in the middle of the Place de la Concorde and police with shields and batons fired tear gas and moved to clear the square.\n\nBy nightfall, 120 people had been arrested, Paris police told AFP news agency.\n\nBut unions vowed to maintain their opposition to the pension changes, with the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) saying another day of strikes and demonstrations was being planned for Thursday 23 March.\n\nThe constitutional procedure that has prompted all this anger may sound obscure, but it is very much part of the political vocabulary in France.\n\nEven though Mr Macron was re-elected last year on a platform of retirement reforms, his ruling coalition has no majority in the Assembly and would have needed support from the Republicans party to pass the pension changes.\n\nOfficials from Mr Macron's Renaissance party spent the morning desperately whipping members into line in a bid to pass their bill.\n\nThey knew some of their MPs could vote against or abstain, faced with the evident unpopularity of the bill, so they resorted to special constitutional powers.\n\nBut whenever a government invokes the 49:3, it can be sure it will be accused straight away of riding roughshod over the will of the people.\n\nIn fact, it has been used precisely 100 times in the more than 60 years of the Fifth Republic, and by governments of all shades.\n\nObviously, it tends to be used more frequently by governments that do not have an in-built majority in parliament, such as the socialist Michel Rocard's in the 1980s and \u00c9lisabeth Borne's today.\n\nShe has in fact already used it several times, but those occasions were for public finance bills which were less controversial.\n\nUse of the procedure is a way to bypass a vote which might be lost, but the down side for the government is that the opposition parties can immediately table a vote of no-confidence.\n\nIf these are voted through, the government falls. That is a theoretical possibility now, but unlikely, because it would mean the far-right, the left and much of the conservative opposition all coming together.\n\nThe dispute once again makes France look unreformable. By comparison with other countries in Europe, the change to the pension age is far from dramatic.\n\nBut the bill is regularly described by opponents as \"brutal\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading\".\n\nMorale in France is low and getting lower, and people see retirement as a bright spot in the future. But many feel that this is a rich man's government taking even that away.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "Amjal Shahpal praised the killer of French school teacher Samuel Paty for being \"as brave as a lion\" on Twitter\n\nA man who posted an image of a terrorism victim's severed head on Twitter, urging others to decapitate those who insult Islam, has been found guilty of encouraging terrorist acts.\n\nAjmal Shahpal also praised the killer of French school teacher Samuel Paty for being \"as brave as a lion\".\n\nThe 41-year-old, of Birkin Avenue in Radford, Nottingham, was convicted after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.\n\nHe is due to be sentenced on 13 April.\n\nJurors deliberated for about five hours before convicting Shahpal by majority verdicts of one count of intentionally encouraging terrorist acts and one of doing so recklessly.\n\nAjmal Shahpal was on trial at Birmingham Crown Court\n\nHe was cleared of a third charge of encouraging acts of terrorism.\n\nAfter the verdicts, Judge Melbourne Inman KC rejected a bail application and remanded Shahpal in custody.\n\nThe judge told him: \"You have been convicted of two offences.

It grew to 3,177 in 2020-21.\n\nThere were also more births registered to women aged 32 or over in 2021 compared with 2011.\n\nThe RCM said older women were more likely to experience higher rates of pregnancy-related conditions and higher rates of assisted birth, leading to longer stays in hospital.\n\nThe State of Maternity Services 2023 report said \"all of these factors and more have massively increased and complicated the workload of our midwives\".\n\nThe RCM said Northern Ireland needed to take several steps to deliver high quality, safe, care for women and babies, including the funding and publication of a new maternity and neonatal strategy.\n\nIt would help design and plan services based on current trends.\n\nNorthern Ireland is the only region in the UK without an active maternity strategy. The last one ended in 2018.\n\nThe report said: \"Demand for maternity services cannot be managed through waiting lists, so it is vitally important to base workforce planning on evidence rather than assumptions.\"\n\nIt said without a strategy, policies risked \"being piecemeal, contradictory and without buy-in from everyone involved\".\n\nThe RCM said a new strategy had cross-party support but was \"held back by the frustrating continuation of the suspension of the assembly and executive\" in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn response, the Department of Health said an independent review of midwifery services was due to be published in autumn this year.\n\n\"It is envisaged that this programme of work will help form the basis of a new maternity strategy in due course,\" it said.\n\nThe RCM report comes amid wide-scale budgetary pressures for the Department of Health, which has seen cuts to some health programmes and services.\n\nThe RCM welcomed an increase in student midwives, with more than 70 graduating each year.\n\nBut retention of existing staff also needed to be prioritised in order to see the workforce grow. The report pointed to 129 midwife vacancies across Northern Ireland in December 2022.\n\n\"We need urgently for politicians to get back to work in the institutions.

Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis will announce his 2024 presidential bid in an online appearance with Twitter CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday.\n\nMr Musk is scheduled to host a Twitter Spaces conversation with Mr DeSantis at 18:00 local time (22:00 GMT).\n\nAn official launch video from the DeSantis campaign is expected later the same evening.\n\nMr DeSantis, 44, is viewed as former president Donald Trump's chief rival for the Republican Party's nomination.\n\nThe governor joins a growing list of contenders seeking to unseat Mr Trump, who leads by more than 30 points in national opinion polls.\n\nRepublican voters go to the polls in a series of primary elections beginning next February to determine which candidate will face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 2024 general election.\n\nTwitter Spaces is a platform that allows \"creators\" to host live audio conversations that other Twitter users can join and engage with.\n\nWednesday's event will be moderated by tech entrepreneur David Sacks, a close ally of the Tesla founder and a supporter of Mr DeSantis.\n\nA Fox News tweet about the upcoming Twitter Spaces \"interview\" was retweeted by Mr Musk to his 140 million followers on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the two plan to appear together in person and whether Mr Musk is showing support for the Floridian's campaign by hosting the launch on his platform..\n\nAt a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) event earlier, Mr Musk claimed the occasion will mark \"the very first time\" such an announcement takes place on social media.\n\nHe told attendees that he was not planning to make an endorsement but wants to use Twitter as a public town square.\n\nThe tech mogul has previously expressed support for Mr DeSantis in 2024, including writing on Twitter last November that his preference is for \"someone sensible and centrist\".\n\nMr DeSantis's announcement will come on the first day of a fundraising retreat in Miami where his supporters will reportedly be briefed about the upcoming campaign.\n\nIt will end months of speculation about when Mr DeSantis will officially announce his candidacy.\n\nHis tenure as Florida's governor has seen the state expand gun-ownership laws, implement restrictions on sex and gender identity education in public schools, and bring in new limits on abortion.\n\nOver the coming months, he is expected to pitch himself as an accomplished politician with a long list of conservative policy achievements and without the \"daily drama\" of Mr Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, he aimed thinly veiled criticism at the former president, saying that governing is not about \"building a brand or talking on social media\".\n\nMr Trump is no longer an active user of Twitter, although his account was re-instated in November after it was removed in the wake of the 6 January riots at the US Capitol.\n\nInstead, Mr Trump uses his own platform, Truth Social, where he has frequently launched broadsides against Mr DeSantis.\n\nTwitter has significantly more active users than Truth Social, potentially giving the DeSantis campaign an opportunity for more publicity.\n\nIt will also give him the ear of Mr Musk's large fan base.", "Principal Sean Spillane said pupils were prevented from going to school\n\nThe principal of a primary school that was

lifted on Tuesday afternoon and a few hours later, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the security operation had ended.\n\nWhen asked what had sparked the day-long alert, a PSNI spokeswoman said: \"Police received information concerning the pitches and took proactive steps to ensure the area was safe.\"\n\nBomb disposal equipment was used during the searches at Henry Jones playing fields\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, staff at Lough View Integrated Primary School said they were advised by police to keep their building closed during the operation.\n\nIts headteacher Sean Spillane said the closure had disrupted his pupils' education and the alert had stopped people in the area from going to work.\n\n\"I'm so shocked today that we've had to take this action, but more than anything it's just disappointment, it's just disillusionment and anger as well,\" Mr Spillane told the BBC's Nolan Show.\n\n\"We're now having to explain to our children that some people, because they don't agree with a particular sport being played across the road from our school, that they can't exercise their right to come to school today.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, PSNI Ch Insp Rosemary Thompson said: \"A thorough search of the playing fields at Church Road in Castlereagh has been conducted and, thankfully, nothing untoward has been found.\"\n\nThe statement added that PSNI \"enquiries remain ongoing\" and asked for anyone with information to contact them.\n\nSecurity force personnel are wearing protective gear during the search operation\n\nEarlier, East Belfast

Some 60,000 remained in a few blocks in the ghetto until a new round of deportations began in January 1943.\n\nHundreds of young, poorly equipped Jewish fighters withheld the onslaught of German troops for three weeks.\n\nAs the Nazis burned the ghetto block by block, many people were burnt alive or suffocated.\n\nOf the remaining residents, almost all were captured and sent to the death camps of Majdanek and Treblinka in Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\nNazi soldiers march Jews out of the ghetto on 19 April 1943\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Steinmeier - together with Polish President Andrzej Duda and Israeli President Isaac Herzog - laid wreaths at the monument to the ghetto heroes in Warsaw.\n\nAnd speaking at the commemorative ceremony, the German president said that President Putin's war \"brings immeasurable suffering, violence, destruction and death to the people of Ukraine\".\n\n\"You in Poland, you in Israel, you know from your history that freedom and independence must be fought for and defended. You know how important it is for a democracy to defend itself.\n\n\"But we Germans, too, have learned the lessons of our history.

It never automatically issued vouchers, which had to be requested by a passenger.\n\nBut it said it recognised that during the height of the pandemic it could not offer \"all the usual channels for customers to request a refund\".\n\nAs a result, it added, if a customer had been due to travel on a flight cancelled by the airline between 9 March 2020 and 19 November 2020 and they opted for a voucher, BA had already contacted them to offer a full refund.\n\n\"We have issued 4.8 million refunds since the start of the pandemic and offered highly flexible booking policies enabling millions of our customers to change their travel dates or destinations,\" BA said.", "Last updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nSarina Wiegman says England are in a \"good place\" despite being held by Portugal in their final match on home soil before heading to Australia for the 2023 Women's World Cup.\n\nThe Lionesses were frustrated as they failed to find the net and twice hit the bar on their way to registering 23 attempts in front of a 26,267 crowd in Milton Keynes.\n\n\"We should have put it in the back of the net. We all know that,\" said the England boss, who flies to Australia with her players on Wednesday.\n\n\"We created lots of chances, and of course we wanted to score that goal.

They lacked energy, presumably impacted by the fact they had not played for several weeks following the end of the Women's Super League (WSL) season, and were forced out wide for large periods by a stubborn Portugal defence.\n\nDaly should have scored early on though when Lauren Hemp curled in an inviting cross at the back post, only for her to poke the ball wide, while James showed glimpses of quality, combining nicely with full-back Bronze on the right-hand side.\n\nHowever, it was not until the second half that the European champions started to show spark and their superiority.\n\u2022 None All the best 2023 Women's World Cup content\n\nRusso's introduction had an impact as she dropped in deep to link up with James, who moved to the number 10 position and was more effective than Ella Toone had been in the opening half.\n\nThe striker had the best of the chances, firing wide on two occasions when teed up by Kelly, as well as being denied by Borges' block on the line.\n\nIn a flurry of chances, Bronze's header crashed against the crossbar and Kelly also had a shot parried away. Hemp had an earlier chance but she could not get her header on target.\n\nIt gives Wiegman food for thought on team selection and what system to play, with England's opening game of the World Cup fast approaching.\n\nEngland are not short of talent, even with several key players missing through injury, but finding a way for them to work together remains Wiegman's biggest challenge - and she appears to be more unsure on how the team will look than she was going into Euro 2022.\n\nSeveral key players will miss the World Cup through injury including captain Leah Williamson and forward Beth Mead - who were both watching on in Milton Keynes - meaning England will have to adapt in Australia.\n\nThey were most effective when they were able to get in behind Portugal's defence in the second half, with Kelly particularly fruitful out wide.\n\nAs the game wore on, England's connections started to build, and James' link-up play with Bronze and Russo in particular helped her claim for a World Cup starting position.\n\nThe Chelsea forward was one of England's brightest players, while Daly failed to take her chance from the start as number nine, struggling to have an impact and missing a few opportunities.\n\nYoung Manchester City defender Esme Morgan was backed by Wiegman to start at centre-back despite struggling against Australia, but here she showed maturity and composure alongside Jess Carter.\n\nIf Millie Bright, who has not featured since March because of a knee injury, does not recover in time for the opening game of the tournament, Morgan has shown she is capable of playing there.\n\nAll in all, the shutout provided successful auditions for James, Morgan and Russo, less so for Toone and Daly.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

After that we can have negotiations.\"\n\nHe said he had no personal problem with Gen Burhan, but regarded him as a traitor for bringing into government those loyal to former President Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted by the army and RSF together in 2019 after mass street protests.\n\nBashir's regime - in power for three decades - was known for its Islamist ideology and imposition of a strict version of Sharia (Islamic law).\n\n\"Unfortunately Burhan is being led by the radical Islamic front leaders,\" Hemedti said.\n\nIn 2021, he and Gen Burhan overturned an agreement to share power with civilians, taking full control in a coup.\n\nThey fell out this year over the proposed return to civilian rule, in particular about the timeframe of incorporating Hemedti's 100,000-strong Rapid Support Force's (RSF) into the army.\n\n\"I am looking forward to having the civilian government today - before tomorrow, a fully civilian government. This is my principle,\" Hemedti told the BBC.\n\nThis is not the first time the RSF leader has spoken of his commitment to democracy, although analysts point out that his forces have brutally put down civilian protests in the past.\n\nHemedti told the BBC that his RSF fighters were not the enemies of the military soldiers, explaining they were battling to protect the country from \"the relics of the government of the past 30 years\".\n\n\"We won't fight you.

He was given his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999.\n\nIn addition to his performance work, Spacey was the artistic director at the Old Vic theatre in London between 2004 and 2015.\n\nThe US star was recognised for his work by being made an honorary Commander and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2010 and 2015, respectively.\n\nBut a string of allegations of sexual misconduct made against him - part of a Hollywood reckoning which began with a Harvey Weinstein expos\u00e9 in October 2017 - brought his career to a halt.\n\nSpacey, who always denied the claims, then came out as a gay man - a move he was criticised for by some figures in the gay community, who suggested he was attempting to shift the focus away from the allegations. The actor later expressed his regret for this, saying that was never his intention.\n\nOne of the allegations was made by actor Anthony Rapp, who said he was 14 when Spacey invited him to a party and made a sexual advance towards him. His claims reached court in New York last year, but after a three-week civil trial, the lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nSpacey's tenure at the Old Vic was also scrutinised, after 20 male staff members at the theatre alleged he had behaved inappropriately towards them.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAs a result of the sexual misconduct claims against Spacey - some of which formed part of his recent trial in London - the projects he was appearing in at the time they were made were thrown into doubt.\n\nScenes from a film which was already in the can, All The Money in the World, were re-shot with a new actor, Christopher Plummer, replacing Spacey.\n\nThe actor was also fired from his role as Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards, and production on the show's sixth season was suspended for several months.\n\nWhen it finally resumed, the number of episodes had been cut from 13 to six, with Spacey's co-star Robin Wright taking over the lead role.\n\nSpacey had been effectively ostracised from Hollywood, and worked only rarely in the years following the accusations.\n\nHowever, the actor found some solace in Italy, where he still enjoyed a pocket of support.\n\nHe gave his first public performance for almost two years, in 2019, reading a poem about at museum in Rome\n\nHis first high-profile appearance in the country came in 2019 when he recited Gabriele Tinti's poem The Boxer for members of the public at a museum in Rome. The poem is about a boxer lamenting the loss of his once-glorious career.\n\nSpacey's performance came less than three weeks after prosecutors in New York dropped a criminal case relating to charges of indecent assault and battery.\n\nHe went on to work with Italian director Franco Nero on 2022's L'uomo Che Disegn\u00f2 Dio (The Man Who Drew God), marking his return to acting with a role as a police detective.\n\nIn January 2023, he was given a lifetime achievement award by Italy's National Museum of Cinema.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe museum, in Turin, said it gave the prize in recognition of Spacey's \"personal aesthetic and authorial contribution to the development of the art of drama\".\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the actor thanked the museum for having the \"balls\" to present him with the award.\n\nBut by the summer, he was appearing in Southwark Crown Court in London, denying nine sexual offences between 2001 and 2013.\n\nThe trial lasted nearly four weeks and heard from multiple witnesses, including Spacey himself.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spacey was found not guilty on all counts.\n\nSo what could be next for Kevin Spacey? Hollywood is no stranger to comeback stories, so it is certainly possible we could see him on screen again before long.\n\nBut Spacey's future will ultimately come down to whether or not the public will still have the appetite to see his films - and whether or not he still wants to make them.", "The government borrowed less than expected in June, helped by higher tax receipts and a big drop in debt interest payments.\n\nBorrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - fell to \u00a318.5bn, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nIt is \u00a3400m lower than last June and below predictions by the government's independent forecaster.\n\nBut the ONS said borrowing is still the third highest for June on record.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had expected public borrowing to reach \u00a321.1bn.\n\nMeanwhile, the ONS said that borrowing for April and May had been revised down by \u00a37bn.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt \"now looks likely to have a little more wiggle room in the Autumn Statement to fund a few pre-election giveaways\".\n\nBut she added: \"With the full upward impact on borrowing from higher interest rates and weaker GDP growth still coming down the line, we continue to think any package of pre-election net tax cuts will probably need to be modest or swiftly reversed.\"\n\nMr Hunt said it was important to \"avoid reckless spending\".\n\n\"Now more than ever we need to maintain discipline with the public finances,\" he said.\n\nThe ONS said that the interest paid on government debt hit \u00a312.5bn, below a record \u00a320bn in June last year but still historically high.\n\nSome of the interest that the government pays on its debt is linked to the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation which remains stubbornly high despite a slowdown in June.\n\nThe Bank of England has also been raising its key interest rate since December 2021 to curb rising prices.\n\nTax receipts were stronger than expected in June, at \u00a377.4bn. This was higher than the OBR forecast and \u00a35.6bn more than the same month last year.\n\nOverall, public sector net borrowing between April and June reached \u00a354.4bn - \u00a312.2bn ahead of the comparable period in 2022 but less than the \u00a361.9bn forecast by the OBR.\n\nProviding energy bill support was always going to bump-up public spending, while interest payments on the government's debt have increased too due to higher inflation and interest rates.\n\nBut bigger tax receipts meant a smaller deficit in June than expected.\n\nInflation has meant that there is an increasing number facing higher tax bills, given that the threshold at which different rates of income tax apply aren't being raised in line with the cost of living.\n\nThose receipts also reflect a more resilient economy than some reckoned.

2022 stands at 90%.\n\nA separate freedom of information request by the BBC to TfL showed one in six cars registered in outer London did not meet ULEZ standards last year, based on figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\n\nThe BBC has repeatedly requested the complete data behind the 90% claim from the mayor's office, including the number of vehicles captured on camera.\n\nThe ULEZ is due to be expanded in August\n\nThe official statistics watchdog called on the mayor to provide more details to back up the claim and said it was part of a pattern where the mayor's agency TfL made public claims without publishing supporting evidence.\n\nThe Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), the independent regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority, looked at what Mr Khan has said about ULEZ after a complaint from Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham Munira Wilson in April.\n\nShe said Mr Khan's claim about how few households would be hit by ULEZ was \"misleading.\"\n\nTfL said at the time that nine out of 10 cars seen on its cameras \"driving in outer London on an average day\" did comply with ULEZ standards.\n\nHowever, Ms Wilson said this was not evidence about the number of households affected.\n\nIn his letter to Ms Wilson, UKSA chairman Sir Robert Chote said: \"We are satisfied that data collected by TfL at the time supports the mayor's claim that nine in 10 cars seen driving in outer London now meet ULEZ standards.\n\n\"However, data on households in outer London who have a car that meet ULEZ emissions standards are not available.\n\n\"The statement made by the mayor relating to households in outer London is therefore not supported by publicly available data.\n\n\"The data underlying the mayor's claim on cars driving

\"inconsistent\" with \"principles of intelligent transparency\" and the Code of Practice for Statistics to which the mayor and TfL voluntarily subscribe.\n\n\"This case is one of several examples raised with us in which TfL has made statements or issued press releases based on unpublished TfL data or where data quoted are not provided with sufficient context,\" he said.\n\n\"This prevents interested members of the public from being able to verify the figures, which can undermine trust in the organisations producing the analysis and their other outputs.\n\n\"While some additional

from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500.\n\nThere will also new support for schemes that provide alternatives to single-use items like coffee cups.\n\nCircular Economy Minister Lorna Slater said it was part of a wider package of measures to tackle Scotland's \"throwaway culture\".\n\nMore than \u00a3280m a year is spent cleaning up litter in Scotland, which environmental campaigners say is the worst in a decade.\n\nThe six-year \"National Litter and Fly tipping Strategy\" sets out how national and local government, businesses and communities can work together to drive change.\n\nIt includes an action plan of measures to be carried out by Scottish government and partner agencies in the first year.\n\nA key measure is fines for fly-tipping rising to \u00a3500, with support for private landowners - including funding for trials - to help deter rubbish being dumped on their property.\n\nThere will also be increased action to detect fly-tippers, especially unregistered waste carriers advertising online, and a dedicated Sepa operation to tackle rogue operators.\n\nThe strategy also includes new powers to a fine the registered keeper of a vehicle that has committed a littering offence.\n\nSingle use coffee cups are used in their millions each year\n\nA new online hub will also be launched to provide information and support to community groups and other local organisations about tackling litter problems.\n\nThe strategy has been developed in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautiful and environment agency Sepa.\n\nBarry Fisher, CEO of Keep Scotland Beautiful, said the strategy did not deliver everything they had asked for, but he recognised that Scotland was facing \"a number of challenges which make this unrealistic at this time\".\n\nHe added: \"We realise that the strategy will not immediately reverse the decline we have recorded in cleanliness levels across Scotland, however it is a positive start, and we are now calling on everyone to play their part.\"\n\nCircular Economy minister Lorna Slater said \"enforcement\" was a key theme of the plan.\n\nShe added: \"The strategy sets out robust commitments, including raising fixed penalty

nationals to deter them from migrating to the UK.\n\nThe adverts, which will run in Albanian on Facebook and Instagram, will warn that people will \"face being detained and removed\" if they make the journey.\n\nThe government said the campaign, starting next week, would \"make clear the perils\" migrants on small boats face.\n\nLabour said the move \"beggars belief\", and the asylum system was \"in chaos\".\n\nAccording to the Home Office, Albania is a \"safe and prosperous country\" and many nationals \"are travelling through multiple countries to make the journey to the UK\" before making \"spurious asylum claims when they arrive\".\n\nThe campaign follows a similar social media drive launched by the government in August last year.\n\nThis is one of the adverts the Home Office has ran targeting people considering entering the UK without permission\n\nImmigration minister Robert Jenrick said the campaign would \"work proactively at the source before people set off on dangerous and unnecessary journeys\".\n\nAlbania was the most common nationality applying for asylum in the UK in the year to March 2023, with 13,714 applications by Albanian citizens.\n\nBetween January and March, 1% of small-boat arrivals were from Albania.\n\nMr Jenrick said: \"We are determined to stop the boats and the campaign, launching in Albania this week, is just one component of the Home Office's work upstream to help dispel myths about illegal travel to the UK, explain the realities and combat the lies peddled by evil people-smugglers who profit from this vile trade.\"\n\nThe government would not say how much the publicity drive is expected to cost.\n\nLast year Albanians demonstrated in central London following comments from the government, calling it 'the language of hatred'\n\nTim Naor Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action, called the campaign \"pointless\" and said it \"repeats the myth that refugee migration is illegal\".\n\nHe said: \"This is yet another pointless campaign that shows ministers refuse to understand that a small minority of the world's refugees have very powerful reasons to come here.\n\n\"If the Government wanted to smash the smuggling gangs and stop people crossing the Channel in flimsy boats it would create more safe routes for refugees to travel here to claim asylum.\"\n\nChief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais Steve Smith said \"no amount of taxpayer-funded PR spin\" will deter refugees \"from seeking a safe future\".\n\n\"Refugees have experienced some of the worst things imaginable from war and conflict to torture and human rights abuses.\n\n\"The only solution that will put people smugglers out of business, stop small boat crossings and save lives is to offer safe passage to refugees with a viable asylum claim in the UK.\"\n\nShadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"It beggars belief that as Channel crossings continue to rise and the asylum system is in chaos, all the Conservatives can come up with to stop the criminal gangs is an ad campaign.\n\n\"At every turn, the Tories so-called solutions fail to meet the scale of the crisis. All they are doing is tinkering at the edges.\"\n\nThe campaign follows the government's Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to send asylum seekers who arrive in Britain via unauthorised routes back home or to a third country such as Rwanda.\n\nMinisters also hope the legislation will cut the daily \u00a35.5m cost of housing migrants who make it to the UK.\n\nThe Bill, currently in the House of Lords, has faced backlash from public figures and campaigners including the Archbishop of Canterbury, who argue that it is both unworkable and \"morally unacceptable\".", "Willoughby and Schofield filmed a segment about the lying in state for This Morning\n\nITV's chief executive has backed Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield after the hosts were accused of jumping the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state.\n\nDame Carolyn McCall said the pair did nothing wrong and were \"of course\" safe in their jobs presenting This Morning.\n\nThe reaction in the press and on social media showed \"how misinformation just spreads, and it is really horrible for them\", Dame Carolyn said.\n\n\"I don't think they're feeling great. I mean, it's hard,\" she added.\n\n\"Imagine yourself in the eye of a storm like this, where you're trying to say you've done nothing wrong, and all the noise around you is saying that you have. It's difficult to handle.\"\n\nWilloughby and Schofield were criticised after being seen on a live feed that streamed the viewing of the Queen's coffin. Members of the public queued for many hours to get into Westminster Hall.\n\n\"They did have accreditation,\" Dame Carolyn said. \"Lots of people say they didn't. They were sent by This Morning to do a piece for 20 September, which ran. They were to interview people inside and outside. They didn't displace anyone in the queue. And actually, they've been very misrepresented.\"\n\nWilloughby has said they had \"official permission to access the hall.... strictly for the purpose of reporting\"\n\nThe backlash showed how \"minority shrillness can become very, very loud and can become picked up and can become a story\", she added.\n\nThose taking aim at them included Domino's Pizza, which put out a tweet saying: \"Apologies to anyone waiting on their pizza, we've just received an order from Holly and Phil.\"\n\nDame Carolyn said ITV spoke to Domino's, which advertises on the broadcaster's channels. \"We just said to them, 'What are you doing?'\n\n\"They said, 'We think it's really funny, don't you?' We said, 'No.' They didn't think of the impact that would have on how people would pick that up and start memeing it, and that's what happens with these things.\n\n\"They did not do anything wrong.\"\n\nDame Carolyn was speaking at the Royal Television Society London Convention, in an interview with BBC media editor Amol Rajan.\n\nThe saga of Holly, Phil and The Queue is a very modern one. As Dame Carolyn McCall implied, there is no science as to why some stories take off on social media and others don't. Usually, it is an unlikely, toxic mix of factors.\n\nHere, public affection for the Queen, images of other celebrities who queued for hours, and Holly and Phil's reputation as cuddly and relatable presenters contrived to see them fall foul of the public mood.\n\nDame Carolyn was speaking at a Royal Television Society event where there was some concern about the impact of a recession on the media. She was very interesting on a curiosity of modern capitalism: namely, why some companies making no profit (like some streaming services) have huge valuations, while others whose underlying business is reporting solid growth (like ITV) are seeing their share price fall.\n\nMarket sentiment, as Britain is finding out this week, is not always rational or predictable.\n\nDame Carolyn also discussed the November launch of streaming service ITVX, which is aiming to upgrade the \"very clunky user experience\" of the ITV Hub.\n\nShe said ITVX would offer many more programmes, with more than 9,000 hours available for free in an attempt to appeal to younger audiences.\n\n\"The issue for Hub was that, with that small amount of content, they wouldn't stay. They'd come in for the whole of Love Island and then they disappear. They wouldn't come back, because there was nothing else for them to watch.\"\n\nITV has not yet found Laura Whitmore's replacement as Love Island host, she said. Asked if the company has found a host for the reboot of Big Brother, she replied: \"Not announced yet.\"\n\nOther broadcasting executives speaking at the convention included BBC director general Tim Davie, who said he was not worried by the departures of a number of high-profile presenters for commercial rivals in recent months.\n\nAt the weekend, Fortunately podcast hosts Fi Glover and Jane Garvey became the latest names to leave, following the likes of Vanessa Feltz, Simon Mayo, Emily Maitlis and Andrew Marr.\n\n\"We didn't look like we had a weak squad in the coverage of the Queen,\" Mr Davie said. \"We have a very broad squad of people. There will be people moving in and out of the BBC. That always has been done to a degree. It's a hyper-competitive market.\"\n\nHe also said having former Downing Street communications director Sir Robbie Gibb on the BBC board had helped the broadcaster in its quest for impartiality.\n\nSir Robbie's presence on the 13-strong board has attracted controversy, with Maitlis recently claiming he was an \"active agent of the Conservative Party\".\n\nMr Davie told delegates: \"We are absolutely fighting for fair and balanced output with due impartiality.\n\n\"We do take board members with all kinds of background and whatever - some of them have baggage.\"\n\n\"But they have views and they are able to share those views, but they don't shape the output.

While we know nothing can be said to change the pain felt by Sean Anderson's family and friends, our deepest condolences remain firmly with them to this day.\"\n\nCape had said at the time: \"Sean was a popular, hard-working and experienced employee. His co-workers are obviously shaken and saddened.\"", "Airports and airlines have told the BBC they are confident they have enough staff to avoid a repeat of last year's disruption in the Easter holidays.\n\nSome struggled with staff shortages last year as passengers returned, leading to delays and cancellations.\n\nWages have risen, as businesses try to attract and keep new recruits.\n\nAirline bosses have warned strikes in France are likely to cause issues, but still expect passenger numbers to return to pre-Covid levels of 2019.\n\nEasyJet's chief operating officer, David Morgan, said: \"When they close an airport because of strikes you are going to see disruption. But the vast majority of flights, even during a disrupted period, will run smoothly\".\n\nEasyJet started recruitment six months early, while Manchester Airport said it already had enough security staff for the summer peak.\n\nPassenger numbers swiftly returned after Covid restrictions were lifted in March 2022. But many holidaymakers encountered huge disruption, as some aviation businesses could not scale up or reverse pandemic job cuts quickly enough to cope.\n\nFor people to get away on flights smoothly, various businesses need to work together with the right resources in place.\n\nLast spring, Manchester Airport faced particular criticism for long queues caused by shortages of security staff. By the summer, its managing director Chris Woodroofe could only promise a \"reasonable\" experience.\n\nThis time he promises a \"great\" experience, adding: \"I can absolutely reassure passengers they won't see the [security] queues they saw in summer 2022. We're aiming to deliver at least 95% of our passengers in fifteen minutes\".\n\nHe said the airport had 350 more security officers than the same time last year, and there would be enough staff in place this April to cope with the busiest day in August.\n\nA new 100 person-strong 'resilience team' has been set up, trained to help in any area where pressure builds up.\n\nStaff shortages led to long queues at airports last Easter\n\nLast year, shortages of ground handlers also proved a particular challenge. These teams do tasks like unloading baggage and helping to prepare the plane for departure.\n\nIt is the responsibility of airlines, many of whom contract out the services to specialist providers. Swissport is the world's biggest, operating at 292 airports including Manchester.\n\nKaren Cox, Swissport UK & Ireland managing director, said returning to peak levels of operations in 2022 had been a \"massive challenge\".\n\nTo prepare better this time, she said Swissport had kept on 5,000 workers over the winter and recruited 1,500 more.\n\nMs Cox described an \"absolute war for labour\", caused by Covid and Brexit reducing the pool of available workers. But she said: \"I sit here now at end of March ready for summer.\"\n\nAs well as recruiting early, she said Swissport had done a number of things to recruit and retain workers.\n\n\"We did the single biggest pay deal in our history, and we've given all of our people advance roster notification so they can actually plan their lives,\" she said.\n\nBacklogs in security clearance for new workers were also an issue last year, but Swissport says this is not a problem now.\n\nAirlines too are optimistic. EasyJet was just one carrier to make large numbers of cancellations last year. The carrier and British Airways offered bonuses as airlines battled to recruit and retain staff.\n\nEasyJet's David Morgan said the airline started hiring for this summer as early as July last year.\n\n\"We would not normally start recruiting until January, something like that,\" he said. \"So we wanted to get ahead of the game to make sure that if there were challenges getting people through, we had plenty of time to do that.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can say confidently that we are fully staffed for this summer. We have a good resilient number of crew in the system even to cope with the bumps if stuff that's thrown at us.\"\n\nMr Morgan acknowledged wages have gone up across the industry, and these costs and higher fuel prices are being reflected in fares.\n\nBut he insisted this was not hitting bookings. \"We are seeing people prioritise travel. Easter is booking really well and we're seeing good signs for the summer as well.\"\n\nThe communication director of travel firm TUI, Aage Duenhaupt, said: \"You can never come to the point where you can give a guarantee for everything. But what we can prepare, that's what we're doing.\"\n\nMr Duenhaupt said ground handling partners had given assurances they now had the right resources in place, and the airline had made extra planes available.\n\nElsewhere, security staff at London Heathrow's Terminal 5 are due to begin a 10-day strike on 31 March, which has already caused British Airways to remove flights from its schedules and could mean queues for security.\n\nIn a cost of living crisis, are people still keen to travel? Richard Slater of Henbury Travel in Macclesfield thinks so.\n\nHe said many customers - who include those looking for package holidays and cruises - are booking late. But his agency had \"seen incredible demand, back to 2019 in fact probably higher\".\n\n\"We're certainly seeing some people having to cut their cloth a little bit and potentially shorten their holiday, whereas others have been saving up through the pandemic,\" he added.", "A beach resort bristling with fortifications. A major road lined with anti-tank ditches. Satellite analysis by BBC Verify has uncovered some of the extensive defences built by Russia as it prepares for a major Ukrainian counter-attack.\n\nAfter months of stalemate, the expected assault is likely to be a crucial test for Ukraine as it seeks to prove it can achieve significant battlefield gains with the weapons it has received from the West.\n\nBy examining hundreds of satellite images, the BBC has identified some key points in the significant build-up of trenches and other fortifications in southern Ukraine since October.\n\nThese four locations offer an insight into what Russia expects from the counter-offensive, and what defences Ukrainian forces might encounter.\n\nSeized by Russia in 2014, Crimea was formerly known for its beach resorts.\n\nNow, instead of sun loungers and parasols, the coastline stretching for 15 miles (25km) is littered with defence structures installed by Russian troops.\n\nThe image below shows the only open sandy beach on the west coast without natural defences such as cliffs or hills.\n\nFirstly, there are \"dragon's teeth\" along the shore: pyramid-shaped blocks of concrete, designed to block the path of tanks and other military vehicles.\n\nBehind them is a line of trenches, providing cover from incoming attacks. Several bunkers can also be spotted along the trenches.\n\nStacks of wood, digging machines and stores of dragon's teeth along the coast suggest building work was still in progress when the image was taken in March.\n\nSome military experts suggest the defences are likely to be a precaution, rather than a sign that Russia expects to defend a seaborne assault, since Ukraine has little naval capacity.\n\nIntelligence analyst Layla Guest says: \"The fortifications are likely in place to deter any bold Ukrainian operation to attack Crimea via the sea rather than on land.\"\n\nThe beach fortification is just one example of a vast network of trenches, as shown by the black dots in the map below, based on work by open-source analyst Brady Africk.\n\nBBC Verify has been able to identify other key fortification sites by pinpointing individual trench locations from videos on social media.\n\nOnce an exact location was discovered it was then possible to trace an entire trench network using satellite images.\n\nThe small city of Tokmak lies on a key route in the south-east of the country that Ukrainian forces may want to use to cut off Crimea from other Russian-held territories.\n\nThere have been reports that Ukrainian civilians have been moved out in order to turn the city into a military fortress. This would provide soldiers with access to supplies and a base to retreat to.\n\nThe satellite image above shows that a network of trenches in two lines has been dug north of Tokmak - the direction Ukraine would have to attack from.\n\nBehind these trenches is a further ring of fortifications around the city, with three layers of defences that can be seen distinctly in this close-up satellite image.\n\nThe top of the satellite image shows an anti-tank ditch. These are usually at least 2.5m deep and designed to trap any enemy tanks that attempt to cross.\n\nBehind the ditch are several rows of dragon's teeth and another trench network.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces are likely to face further traps.\n\nIt's highly likely that mines have also been hidden between Tokmak's three defence lines, says Mark Cancian from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"Minefields are a standard part of every defence, and the Russians have used them extensively throughout the war.\n\n\"Here they will be large and better concealed, slowing down Ukrainian attacks so that other combat elements, like artillery and infantry, can strike the attacking forces.\"\n\nBBC Verify has also discovered three other towns near Tokmak have been similarly fortified.\n\nA line of anti-tank ditches and trenches now runs alongside a 22-mile (35km) stretch of the E105 main highway, west of Tokmak.\n\nThe E105 is strategically important, connecting Russian-held Melitopol in the south with the northern city of Kharkiv, held by Ukraine. The road also runs through the Zaporizhzhia region, which could be the target of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nThe side that controls the E105 can easily move troops around the region.\n\nIf Ukrainian forces attempt to use this road, Russia will likely target it with heavy artillery from behind their defences. Russia's position is also in range of another nearby road - the T401 - which could also be targeted.\n\n\"The Russians are worried about the recently built Ukrainian armour units. If these units can get on a main highway, they can move very quickly,\" says Mr Cancian.\n\n\"The Russian defences aim to push them off the roads and therefore slow them down.\"\n\nThe port of Mariupol has a strategic position between the Russian-occupied territories in the east and Crimea in the south. It also became a symbol of resistance to invasion when a hard-core of fighters held out for months as the city was besieged.\n\nGiven Russia expects Ukraine to try to retake it, BBC Verify decided to look at the territory surrounding the city - leading to the discovery of a collection of circular trenches.\n\nLocated near the small village of Rivnopil about 34 miles (55km) north of Mariupol, each circular trench has a mound of soil in the middle, possibly either to protect artillery or to keep guns stable.\n\nMeanwhile, the circular trenches allow soldiers to take cover and to move the artillery so it can aim in any direction.\n\nIt shows that Russia is preparing to defend areas of open ground (without natural protection from hills and rivers) alongside their wider trench network.\n\nBut some analysts note that Ukrainian forces can use similar satellite images and drone surveillance to identify and bypass many of these defences.\n\nAlexander Lord from strategic advisory firm Sibylline Ltd says: \"The Russians will therefore likely attempt to funnel Ukrainian forces down certain routes which are heavily mined and pre-targeted by Russian artillery.\"\n\nSatellite images show obvious defences - but that might all be part of Russia's plan.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRead more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify", "The speeding groom was pulled over on the M4 in Wiltshire\n\nA groom heading to his wedding was pulled over by traffic police who caught him speeding at 121mph on a motorway.\n\nWiltshire Police Special Ops tweeted \"usually, the bride is always late\" but the wedding-bound driver had \"some explaining to do\" after being pulled over on the M4 in his silver BMW.\n\n\"A rear nearside tyre with cord exposed topped this stop off,\" the force added.\n\nThe speeding groom will appear in court at a date to be confirmed.\n\nWiltshire Police confirmed that members of the wedding party later collected the groom to take him to his ceremony.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The harm done by that one word is absolutely immeasurable\".\n\nOfsted inspected the school again in June in line with government guidelines to monitor schools that need to improve - and not as a result of Ms Perry's death.\n\nIn their latest report, seen by the BBC, the watchdog said: \"The school's work to address previous weaknesses has been swift, thorough and effective.\"\n\nThe primary school was initially inspected in November 2022 and subsequently rated inadequate after concerns were raised over leadership and management.\n\nMs Perry's family said the inspection process caused her significant distress.\n\nFor Caversham Primary school this is a bittersweet moment for staff and parents.\n\nIt's just six months since Ruth Perry's suicide left a gaping hole in the school community.\n\nFor her colleagues this is recognition of everything they have done.\n\nFor her family it raises again the question of whether the stakes of Ofsted inspection have been far too high for headteachers.\n\nMPs are to hold an inquiry in the autumn looking at how the inspection system is working. It won't consider the circumstances around Ruth Perry's death, which will be examined by a coroner.\n\nThe new report said useful advice was sought from beyond the school straight after the last inspection.\n\n\"In particular, this helped leaders to understand fully the extent of the weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements and prioritise what needed to be done,\" the report said.\n\nIn a statement, the head teacher's sister Ms Waters said staff at the school who had worked with or been trained by Ms Perry had never been anything other than \"excellent, caring and professional\".\n\nShe added: \"The reversal of the previous judgement in a matter of a few months illustrates why schools should be given the opportunity to correct any technical weaknesses before the final report is published.\n\n\"An inspection should be about helping schools with independent scrutiny, not catching them out and publicly shaming them.\"\n\n\"That Ruth was left feeling suicidal as a result of Ofsted's previous judgement demonstrates, in the most tragic way possible, the intolerably high stakes created by the current inspection system,\" she added.\n\nAn inquest later this year will fully investigate Ms Perry's death, which also prompted a wider debate about whether one-word grades for schools make sense.\n\nIn their latest report Ofsted said the arrangements for safeguarding at Caversham Primary School were effective.\n\n\"A positive culture of safeguarding now pervades the school,\" it added.\n\nLast month, Ofsted announced changes to its inspection system.\n\nThese included allowing schools that were given an inadequate rating over safeguarding to be re-inspected within three months, giving them a chance to be re-graded if they have addressed concerns.\n\nOfsted previously said it always strived to make inspections \"as positive an experience for school staff as they can be\".\n\nMPs have now launched an inquiry into Ofsted's school inspections, looking at how useful they are to parents, governors and schools in England.\n\nAmanda Spielman, the watchdog's chief inspector, previously told the BBC the \"whole school accountability system\" was built around the one-word judgements.\n\nShe acknowledged there were issues around accountability at schools but said scrapping one-word judgements \"wouldn't really solve the underlying discomfort\".\n\nThe Department for Education has also defended one-word inspections.\n\nIt said they \"succinctly summarise independent evaluations on the quality of education, safeguarding, and leadership which parents greatly rely on to give them confidence in choosing the right school for their child\".\n\nIt said the government used them to \"highlight success, identify schools that need support and to trigger intervention where necessary.\"\n\nWatch the story of head teacher, Ruth Perry, who took her life after her school's rating was downgraded by Ofsted.\n\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

So my friends would always look at me like, 'Oh, it's not that bad.'\n\n\"The help isn't a button that is pressed, where you're automatically OK,\" he continued. \"It is something that will always be there and just has to be managed.\"\n\nJamal Edwards gave Ed Sheeran his first big break in 2010\n\nEdwards, who gave Sheeran his first big break, died suddenly from a heart attack in February 2022 after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner concluded.\n\nSheeran said the tragedy convinced him to kick a drug habit he had developed in his 20s.\n\n\"I remember just being at a festival and being like, 'Well, if all of my friends do it, it can't be that bad,'\" he said. \"And then it just turns into a habit that you do once a week and then once a day and then, like, twice a day and then, like, without booze. It just became bad vibes.\n\n\"I would never, ever, ever touch anything again, because that's how Jamal died,\" he added. \"And that's just disrespectful to his memory to even, like, go near.\"\n\nShortly after Edwards' death, Sheeran's wife was diagnosed with a tumour which could not be operated on until after she had given birth to their second daughter, Jupiter.\n\n\"You feel so powerless,\" Sheeran recalled. \"There's nothing you can do about it.\"\n\nSeaborn ultimately carried the baby to term and had successful surgery in June 2022, the morning that Sheeran headlined Wembley Stadium, Rolling Stone said.\n\nThe emotional toll of those events can be seen in a trailer for Sheeran's forthcoming Disney+ documentary, The Sum Of It All.\n\nIn one scene, the star is pictured crying on stage, as he grapples with Edwards' death and Seaborn's health condition, while simultaneously facing a lengthy copyright trial.\n\n\"I've never seen him cry on stage,\" Seaborn observes in the clip. \"He hasn't had the time to process and be at peace with his thoughts.\"\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

And that was the record. It was all very, very, very fast.\"\n\nThe star added that he recorded a second, entirely separate, album with Dessner which has no firm release date at present.\n\nHe also revealed the existence of a collaborative album with reggaeton star J Balvin, as well as forthcoming music with Pharrell, Shakira, David Guetta and Justin Bieber.\n\nIn fact, he told Rolling Stone he has five more albums in mind using another category of symbols.\n\nHe plans to work on the last one in that series on and off for the rest of his life, \"adding songs here and there.

If you stand at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and look up and then you imagine that on top of a mountain range that is already 350m (1,148ft) above sea level. \"\n\nMr Williams is concerned about the impact on people's health and the environment and says he would rather they were offshore.\n\n\"We don't need these, there are plenty of alternatives. It causes a lot of grief and stress for those who live near them and we should be looking at alternatives like hydro, we should be looking at floating offshore wind, and the tidal lagoon in Swansea,\" he said.\n\n\"There are over 200 wind turbines in south Wales already, we're doing our fair share.\"\n\nBut according to the chairman of the UK's independent Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, it is not \"proper\" to say other places should shoulder the burden for tackling climate change.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Residents fear the 250m high turbines would pose risks to wildlife, property values and wellbeing\n\n\"I think every community has to say to itself, 'if we don't have this what are we going to have?'\n\n\"We can't all the time say we're in favour of things but somewhere else. That isn't an acceptable moral position,\" said Lord Deben.\n\nHe added that people could not expect others to carry the cost of net zero without doing something themselves.\n\nThe Welsh government's Future Wales plan has identified 10 areas as suitable for onshore wind developments - two in north Wales, two in south Wales and six in mid and west Wales.\n\nApplications for wind farms will not be automatically approved for these areas, according to the policy, but there is a presumption large-scale wind energy developments will secure planning consent.\n\nDeveloper Bute Energy has submitted plans for four wind farms - one in Conwy county, two in Powys and one on the border between Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf council areas.\n\nAled Rowlands from Bute Energy says the firm is listening to the concerns of local people\n\nIt hopes to connect the projects in Powys to the grid using a network of pylons stretching to Carmarthen as current grid capacity in mid Wales is insufficient to meet future demand, according to a report by a group of Welsh MPs.\n\nThe projects have proved controversial with concerns being raised about their size and proximity to people's homes.\n\nAled Rowlands, the company's director of external affairs, said the firm was listening to the concerns of local people.\n\nThe majority of people support and understand the need for a transition to renewable energy, he said, but that transition will inevitably mean more infrastructure like pylons to improve the current grid capacity.\n\n\"It's very important that society now says what it wants and what is acceptable in order for us to be able to get to net zero, to be able to use clean, green energy,\" said Mr Rowlands.\n\nAccording to the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales (CPRW), there is a \"gold rush\" for net zero, and the number of \"unsuitable applications\" for turbines over 200m (656ft) high and pylons across rural Wales is causing concern in many communities.\n\nDr Jonathan Dean from CPRW's Anglesey branch said the number of recent applications and the alarm they were causing in those areas is unprecedented.\n\n\"I've lost count of the number of projects, it's like a gold rush. I've got big concerns [over whether] that it is a good policy, that it is a fair policy.\n\n\"I'm concerned for communities who are battling against them [like] David and Goliath,\" he said.\n\nThe charity favours using offshore wind to reach, and exceed our net zero goals, but one expert in renewable energy warns against putting our eggs in one basket.\n\nProfessor of renewable energy in the school of engineering at Cardiff University, Nicholas Jenkins, said that to decarbonise the whole of the UK economy by 2050 and the electricity supply by 2035, all of the options need to be available.\n\nWales wants to reach net zero by 2050 and wants to meet 100% of its electricity needs from renewables in 12 years' time.\n\nProf Jenkins warned that focusing on offshore wind and small modular nuclear reactors, at the expense of onshore wind, is a \"risky strategy\".\n\n\"I think it's really questionable whether the required amount of generating capacity can be delivered in time,\" he said.\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We need a range of technologies, at different scales, to meet our future electricity needs as we move towards a net zero energy system. Wind and solar are cost-effective options to generate electricity and have a clear role to play.\n\n\"We want to ensure local communities and people in Wales directly benefit from energy generated in Wales. We are taking action to support local and shared ownership and developing strong, local supply chains.\"", "Tvorchi held up a sign displaying the name of their hometown while participating in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThe hometown of Ukraine's Eurovision act was hit by Russian missiles moments before the band took to the stage in Liverpool, officials say.\n\nThe head of Ternopil regional state administration, Volodymyr Trush, confirmed two people had been injured.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry accused Russia of attacking Kyiv and Ternopil regions before and during Tvorchi's Eurovision performance.\n\nTen minutes before taking to the stage at the Liverpool Arena, Tvorchi posted on Instagram citing reports of Ternopil in western Ukraine being attacked.\n\nAfter performing, they added: \"Ternopil is the name of our hometown, which was bombed by Russia while we sang on the Eurovision stage about our steel hearts, indomitability and will.\n\n\"This is a message for all cities of Ukraine that are shelled every day.

They cannot remember her now. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nWhen British special forces raided a family home in Afghanistan in 2012, they killed two young parents and gravely wounded their infant sons. A BBC investigation has revealed that special forces command didn't refer the incident to military police and it was never investigated, until now. In Afghanistan, a family is still trying to heal.\n\nLate on the evening of 6 August 2012, in the courtyard of a family home in Afghanistan, Abdul Aziz Uzbakzai sat down for the last dinner he would ever have with his son. At the table were Abdul Aziz and his wife, four of their five children, and two of their young grandchildren. It was the 18th night of Ramadan, the holy month when Muslims fast. The family lived together in a modest home in a village called Shesh Aba in Nimruz province.\n\nThat day had begun like any other - a shared pre-dawn breakfast, before sunrise brought the fasting hours and family members went to work. Abdul Aziz's eldest son, Hussain, opened the small grocery shop he ran. Hussain's wife Ruqqia cared for their two young boys and began her work in the home. A goat was slaughtered by a neighbour in anticipation of evening meals that would break the day's fast.\n\nThe only thing out of the ordinary, according to the family's account, was the arrival of two unknown male visitors. In rural Afghanistan, it is not uncommon to receive unexpected guests, and tradition dictates that they are shown hospitality. But Abdul Aziz felt himself becoming wary of the two men, he said, and he called Hussain to close the shop early and come home.\n\nAfter sunset, the two guests were given food and ate separately and they left without incident at 10pm, Abdul Aziz said. It was a hot summer night in Shesh Aba, so the family ate outside. At the end of the meal, Abdul Aziz stood up and said he was tired and would go to bed. He said \"Goodnight Hussain Jan\" - a term of loving affection - to his son, \"Goodnight daughter\" to Ruqqia, and \"Goodnight boys\" to the boys.\n\nAbdul Aziz at the family home in Shesh Aba. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nThe boys were young then - Imran three and his brother Bilal just one and a half. They do not remember anything now about what would unfold later that night, and the family has tried to shield them in the decade since from the worst of the horror. They know that before bedtime, their father had pulled their mattresses out into the courtyard, because the heat had made their shared room stifling, and that they had fallen asleep with their parents, for the last time, under the stars.\n\nBy that point, in 2012, coalition forces had been waging war in Afghanistan for a little over a decade. Elite special forces units from leading coalition countries were regularly carrying out so-called \"Deliberate Detention Operations\", also known as \"Kill/Capture missions\". Troops typically flew in by helicopter after dark and launched fast-moving assaults against suspected Taliban targets. For the UK, these night-time raids were usually executed by the SAS or SBS, the highly-respected special forces units of the British Army and Royal Navy.\n\nBut unknown to the British public at that time, SAS operatives were already suspected at the highest levels of UK Special Forces of illegally killing Afghan men who had surrendered and been detained, and later covering up the killings with fabricated reports. A BBC Panorama investigation published earlier this year revealed that one SAS squadron killed 54 people in suspicious circumstances in one six-month tour. The pattern led one of the highest-ranking special forces officers in the UK to warn in a secret memo to the head of special forces that there could be a \"deliberate policy\" in effect to kill detainees, \"even when they did not pose a threat\".\n\nOne of these \"Kill/Capture\" raids was about to be executed on Abdul Aziz's family home. At about 3am, British military helicopters descended through the dark sky over Nimruz and landed outside the village. Special forces operatives dropped to the ground and moved towards where the family were sleeping. Abdul Aziz was woken by the first gunshots, and within minutes foreign soldiers were in his room, he said, pushing him on the ground, handcuffing and blindfolding him.\n\n\"I pleaded with them to let me go to where my son and daughter-in-law and their children were sleeping,\" Abdul Aziz said. \"I could hear my two daughters screaming and pleading for help. No one was helping them. I could not do anything for my children.\"\n\nThe family lives in a small village made up of traditional mud homes, in Nimruz province. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nChaos had descended on the rural family home. According to his account, Abdul Aziz was blindfolded, beaten and interrogated. The foreign soldiers asked him about the visitors who came to the house earlier that day, he said. He would be kept inside, blindfolded, for the duration of the raid.\n\nThe special forces operatives had also gone to the house next door, where a widower called Lal Mohammad lived with his six sons and three daughters. One of his sons, Mohammad Mohammad, who was 12 at the time, told the BBC that he and his brothers were brought outside and detained by the assault team. He was blindfolded and - possibly because of his young age - taken separately to Hussain's home and held there for the rest of the raid.\n\nIt was only after the troops left the village, hours later, that Abdul Aziz was able to take off his blindfold and go out into the morning light to the place where Hussain and Ruqqia and the boys had been sleeping. \"There was blood everywhere\", he said, \"blood soaked into the sheets and the mattresses.\" According to members of both families who saw Hussain and Ruqqia's bodies, both had been shot in the head. Imran and Bilal's bloody bedclothes lay there, but the boys were gone.\n\nMohammad Mohammad ran back next door to his family home, where he had last seen his older brothers detained by the soldiers. He found Mohammad Wali, who was 26, and Mohammad Juma, who was 28, inside the home, dead with gunshot wounds to the head, he said. Other family members said that the two were shot at close range in the head, and an image of Mohammad Wali's body seen by the BBC appears to show a head wound.\n\nMohammad Mohammad's account appears to mirror the pattern of killings that had already raised suspicions among senior special forces officers.\n\n\"I swear to God, my brothers were farmers,\" he said. \"They worked from dawn until night. They were neither with the Taliban nor with the government. They were killed for no reason.\"\n\nAccording to the accounts of Abdul Aziz and other family members who saw Hussain and Ruqqia's bodies, their eyes were closed and their jaws had been bound shut with cloth tied under the jaw and around the head, maybe to allow the assault team to accurately photograph their faces - a standard procedure after a fatal shooting.\n\nThe young parents appeared to have been killed in their bed, the family said. It was not clear if they had woken up before they died. At first, the family assumed Imran and Bilal were dead too. But the boys had been airlifted out with the special forces, one-year-old Bilal with bullet wounds to his face and shoulder, three-year-old Imran with a gunshot wound in his abdomen, fighting for his young life.\n\nIn the aftermath of the raid, a British military commander had a decision to make. Under UK law, commanders are obliged to inform military police if there is any possibility that a Schedule 2 offence has been committed by a person under their command. Schedule 2 offences are serious offences like unlawful killing and grievous bodily harm. The guidance for commanding officers says that the circumstances must only \"indicate to a reasonable person that a Schedule 2 offence may have been committed\" in order to legally oblige them to refer the incident to the military police. It is considered a low bar.\n\nIn Shesh Aba, a woman was among the dead and two infant boys had been shot. An Afghan newswire report published the day of the raid quoted the local governor as saying that the foreign forces had \"killed and wounded six civilians\", including \"two children\". A former investigator from the Royal Military Police told the BBC that, based on the available information, there was \"no question in my mind that this incident should have been referred to military police\".\n\nBut the BBC has discovered that the raid was never referred to military police and never investigated by anyone outside of UK Special Forces. The Royal Military Police (RMP) told us that they did not appear to have been informed of the Shesh Aba raid at the time, and are now reviewing the incident \"as a direct result\" of our inquiries.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that British forces were involved in the raid and that a Serious Incident Review, or SIR (an internal review undertaken automatically after an operation goes wrong in a serious way) had been carried out, but that the commanding officer had decided against referring the incident to military police.\n\nThe MoD said: \"There is a comprehensive MOD policy in place for actions to be taken in the event of possible civilian casualties.\n\n\"Following a review by senior Army lawyers, it was decided by the Commanding Officer, in accordance with the Armed Forces Act 2006 and MoD policy, that the circumstances did not require a referral to the Service Police.\"\n\nGeneral Sir Mark Carleton-Smith was head of UK Special Forces at the time of the Shesh Aba raid in 2012.\n\nThe BBC asked both the MoD and RMP to reveal the rank of the commanding officer who made the decision, but both declined to say. The BBC has obtained a secret internal special forces document laying out the protocol for deciding on referrals to the military police. It appears to show that once an SIR has been completed, it has to go to the Director Special Forces - the highest-ranking special forces officer in the UK - for a decision on whether to refer the incident.\n\nDirector Special Forces at the time of the Shesh Aba raid was General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, who went on to become the head of the British Army, before stepping down earlier this year. Asked by the BBC about the Shesha Aba raid, General Carleton-Smith said he could not recall whether he was briefed on the \"specific tactical detail of the operation\", but that he was in no doubt he would have been \"guided by the advice of the in-theatre commanders\", as well as the legal judgement of a senior Army lawyer that no referral to military police was necessary.\n\nHe said the recommendation to him at the time from the commanding officer in Afghanistan was that there was no evidence of a criminal offence, that the Rules of Engagement hadn't been broken, and that \"the circumstances of the operation justified the lethal use of force\". He added: \"And I certainly never saw or read any evidence or advice that suggested unlawful behaviour\".\n\nGeneral Carleton-Smith told the BBC it remains his view that \"the Rules of Engagement were correctly observed despite the occasionally tragic outcomes that are sadly inevitable during war\".\n\nThe Rules of Engagement that applied to this raid dictated that lethal force could only have been used against someone who posed an imminent threat to life. There has been no suggestion from the Ministry of Defence that any weapons were found at Hussain and Ruqqia's home or that they were armed when they were shot.\n\nImran and Bilal play marbles in the courtyard, a few feet from a mulberry tree planted in the spot where their parents were killed. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nSIR reports were intended in part to help commanding officers make a decision about whether a referral to military police was necessary. But a former senior RMP officer who served at the time of the raid in Shesh Aba, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said there were \"serious problems\" across the Armed Forces with the use of the reports.\n\n\"Instead of getting to the bottom of what happened and correcting any criminal behaviour, SIRs became a way of cleansing an incident of any wrongdoing,\" he said. \"Some senior officers were using SIRs as a tool to prevent scrutiny. It seemed they were deciding on non-referral and then writing the SIR to justify the decision.\"\n\nThe problem was \"widespread\", the senior officer said, but UK Special Forces was \"notable in its lack of referrals\". The BBC has identified at least three other occasions when an SIR was completed by UK Special Forces but not referred to the RMP. \"In Special Forces, it's easier to keep it 'in house',\" the former senior officer said. \"There's a lot less oversight.\"\n\nA former RMP investigator who spoke to the BBC said he was \"not surprised\" that the Shesha Aba raid was not referred. \"I'm afraid, given my experience of these kinds of cases, I'm not surprised that the commanding officer decided not to inform the police,\" he said. \"But it's clear it should have been looked into.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the RMP said that its current review, prompted by the BBC's inquiries, \"should in no way be taken as implying that the incident was unlawful or that the British Armed Forces had improperly failed to make the Service Police aware, although these are factors that will be considered by our review team as a matter of course\".\n\nThe MoD said that it was \"the long-standing policy of successive governments not to comment on matters relating to Special Forces\" and that all British military operations were \"conducted in accordance with UK and international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict\".\n\nThe BBC asked the MoD if anyone had ever been officially disciplined over the Shesh Aba raid, but they declined to respond.\n\nAs dawn broke over Nimruz that day, the helicopters that had brought the troops flew back to base bearing the wounded Imran and Bilal. The special forces had also taken Hussain's youngest brother, Rahmat Ullah, who was 12.\n\nRahmat had been detained during the raid and he had no idea what had happened. When his blindfold was finally removed, aboard the helicopter, he saw his young nephews. Imran was conscious, crying. \"He looked like he was in severe pain,\" Rahmat recalled. \"He asked me for water, but I didn't have any.\"\n\nThe boys were sent to separate military bases. The family was not allowed to go to where Imran was so, aged just three, he spent the first part of his recovery alone. Eventually he was transferred, and it fell to Abdul Aziz and their grandmother Mah Bibi to comfort the boys and try to explain that their parents were gone.\n\n\"They were just too small to understand,\" Abdul Aziz said. \"Imran would cry more, maybe because of the pain, but maybe because he could sense that his mother was no longer alive.\"\n\nImran stands by his parents' graves. \"I wish our mother and father were with us today,\" he said. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nAbdul Aziz was offered some compensation at the military hospital for the boys' injuries but he refused the money, he said. \"I refused to benefit from the murderers at that time, they had destroyed our world,\" he said.\n\nWhen the boys were discharged, their grandparents took them home to the village. They have lived there since, with their older sister Hajira, in the home where they were shot. They don't remember anything about that night, or the weeks that followed, but after they came home Imran began to scream in his sleep and sleepwalk outside during the night. \"I don't know why I do it,\" he said. \"I am asleep when it happens, and my grandfather or grandmother brings me home.\"\n\nImran and Bilal doing their homework together. The boys look out for one another, Abdul Aziz said. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nImran is 13 now. He has a long surgical scar down the front of his torso and a scar on the left of his belly, and more scar tissue across his lower back. He has bullet fragments inside his torso - including a large fragment embedded in his spine. \"Running causes me pain, and I feel pain in my stomach,\" he said, pointing gently to the scars on his belly and back. \"I also feel more pain in the winter and when the summer comes I'm relieved.\"\n\nBilal is 11. He has a scar on his face from a bullet that hit him millimetres from his left eye and a scar on his shoulder where another round hit him and left a bullet fragment inside his bone. He gets pain in his arm when he uses it a lot, he said, and the position of the scar on his face is a permanent reminder of how close he came to death.\n\nScars on Imran's abdomen show the damage from the bullet wound as well as his surgical incision. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nBoth boys have bullet fragments inside them. Imran has a large fragment lodged in his spine. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nThe boys go for a few hours in the mornings to a religious school, but there is no proper school nearby that they can attend for full time education. Imran enjoys the lessons, particularly reading. Bilal is less keen. \"I don't like school,\" he said, with a smile. He likes playing with his older brother. On a cool afternoon in October, the two of them played marbles in the courtyard of their home, and they looked as though they were in their own little world. A few feet away, there was a Mulberry tree in the place where their parents were killed. Either side of the Mulberry tree were two thin Jujube trees, planted by Imran and Bilal, for Mohammad Wali and Mohammad Juma, their neighbours who were killed.\n\nImran and Bilal do not talk much about their parents. They have no memory of Hussain and Ruqqia, so their loss is defined by a general sense of absence. \"I wish our mother and father were with us today,\" Imran said, \"so we could go to the city to walk around and enjoy ourselves, as other children can.\"\n\nThe family is poor, and the boys have had limited access to medical care since they were discharged a decade ago. Recently, they travelled to the trauma hospital in the city of Lashkar Gah, about six hours' drive from the village, for a medical examination arranged by the BBC. X-rays showed the bullet fragments still lodged in their bodies. It was the first time the boys had ever seen them. The doctors said that nothing could be done to safely remove the fragments from Imran's torso, so he will have to live with them. \"He is lucky to be alive,\" the surgeon said.\n\nAs the boys were examined, Abdul Aziz sat quietly alongside them and held their hands, just as he had sat with them 10 years ago, in another hospital, when they were much smaller, knowing that they were his responsibility now.\n\nImran sits in a hospital in Lashkar Gah, where the boys were examined in October. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nAbdul Aziz has raised the boys since the night of the raid. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nHussain and Ruqqia were married on a hot summer's day in 2006, in Zahedan, Iran, where Ruqqia's family lived. Excitement had been building in the village in Afghanistan, and when the appointed day came Abdul Aziz and about 100 members of the wider family set out across the border for the ceremony.\n\nWhen they returned a few days later with the new bride and groom, there were celebrations to rival the festival of Eid. Livestock was slaughtered to make rich meals for the family and their neighbours. Those who had new clothes wore them. Those who didn't have new clothes wore the best clothes they had. \"It was a joyous moment for everyone,\" Abdul Aziz recalled. \"From then on, I called Ruqqia my daughter.\"\n\nHussain opened a small grocery shop in the village. Ruqqia was a 'Hafiz Quran', a memoriser of the Muslim holy book, and she taught local children. Shortly after the wedding, their daughter Hajira was born, and then Imran, and a year and a half later Bilal. Hussain took on a new role as the head of the family and the financial provider. He doled out pocket money to his siblings, paid for their schooling and later their weddings. \"He was our strength and power,\" said his younger brother, Mansour. \"We didn't worry about a thing when he was alive.\"\n\nThe boys help with work in the fields. \"I am getting older, it is harder to work,\" Abdul Aziz said.

He regrets turning down the offer of compensation for the boy's injuries. If it came again today he would accept. \"I am getting older, and it is harder to work and harder to feed the children,\" he said.\n\nAt one time, Abdul Aziz would set off every day after work, under the burning sun or through bracing cold, to the cemetery where his son and daughter-in-law are buried. Hussain's mother, Mah Bibi, often walked with him. Eventually, her sadness overtook her and became a depression that she has not recovered from, and now she cannot go as often. Abdul Aziz suffers too. He is physically tired. But every Friday he walks a kilometre along the dusty track that leads from the village to the graves. They lie in a small, walled off area of the cemetery reserved for those killed by the foreign soldiers. There are eight graves there in total. Two belong to Hussain and Ruqqia. Two to Mohammad Wali and Mohammed Juma.\n\nLast Friday, Abdul Aziz set out for his weekly visit. For half an hour, as the sun set, he sat still by the graves and said prayers for Hussain and for Ruqqia. He spoke to his son. \"I told him that I missed him, and that I could still remember him when he was just a little boy,\" Abdul Aziz said afterwards. He had not uttered a word by the grave. \"I do not speak to him aloud,\" he said. \"I speak to him in my heart.\"\n\nKiyya Baloch and Ahmad Naveed Nazari contributed to this report\n\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\n\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\n\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\n\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

which can be won with victory at home to Chelsea on Sunday - and the FA Cup, where they play Manchester United in the final at Wembley.\n\nReal keeper Thibaut Courtois performed heroics to save two Erling Haaland headers early in the first half but he was powerless to stop Bernardo Silva's close-range finish after 23 minutes, the Portugal midfielder scoring a looping header for the second eight minutes before half-time.\n\nCity faced the occasional threats from Real after the break, Ederson saving well from David Alaba and Karim Benzema, but they were no match and when Manuel Akanji's header deflected in off Eder Militao 14 minutes from time the celebrations started.\n\nSubstitute Julian Alvarez then wrapped up the dominant win with a late strike after latching onto a brilliant Phil Foden pass.\n\nCity will play Inter on 10 June as they look to win the Champions League for the first time.\n\nCity have put themselves in a magnificent position to become only the second English club to win the Treble first claimed by Manchester United in 1999.\n\nCity look to have finally broken Arsenal in the Premier League title race and will be overwhelming favourites to beat Inter Milan, although the desire to keep this feat for themselves will provide fuel and inspiration for United in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\n\nGuardiola's side have somehow found ways to miss out on the Champions League in the past but the addition of Haaland's sheer menace as well as more defensive steel makes it difficult to see how they will not find a way past surprise finalists Inter.\n\nCity made a Real side full of experience and quality look several classes beneath them in a first half that will be among the finest this stadium has seen, the dazzling interplay, fierce intensity and pace giving them a two-goal advantage that would have been far more but for the excellence of Courtois.\n\nThis night had a special atmosphere even before kick-off and victory will taste even sweeter after the pain of last season's loss at the same stage, when City were almost in the final only to concede two stoppage-time goals and eventually go out.\n\nThe Champions League has inflicted various levels of anguish on City despite their domestic dominance but if they perform anything like this in Istanbul it is hard to see an efficient but unspectacular Inter side having enough to trouble them.\n\nEnd of an era for Real?\n\nReal should never be written off with their history of success but there was an end-of-an-era feel about the manner of this defeat.\n\nThe side who put Liverpool and Chelsea out of the Champions League with the minimum of fuss looked its age here as City ran the holders ragged.\n\nLuka Modric was taken off and replaced by Antonio Rudiger just after the hour, the 37-year-old's future at the Bernabeu uncertain, while even Karim Benzema, 35, was unable to pose his usual threat.\n\nReal will refuse to stand still and the way they were outclassed here may only speed up the rate of change, with England's teenage sensation Jude Bellingham looking set to arrive to supplement the next generation midfielders alongside Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni.\n\nWhether the great Carlo Ancelotti remains in charge will also be a point of debate with change often in the air if Real go a season without winning either La Liga or the Champions League.\n\nWhatever the outcome, the Italian manager keeps his place in history as the only coach to win this tournament four times.\n\u2022 None Goal!

Some 60,000 remained in a few blocks in the ghetto until a new round of deportations began in January 1943.\n\nHundreds of young, poorly equipped Jewish fighters withheld the onslaught of German troops for three weeks.\n\nAs the Nazis burned the ghetto block by block, many people were burnt alive or suffocated.\n\nOf the remaining residents, almost all were captured and sent to the death camps of Majdanek and Treblinka in Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\nNazi soldiers march Jews out of the ghetto on 19 April 1943\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Steinmeier - together with Polish President Andrzej Duda and Israeli President Isaac Herzog - laid wreaths at the monument to the ghetto heroes in Warsaw.\n\nAnd speaking at the commemorative ceremony, the German president said that President Putin's war \"brings immeasurable suffering, violence, destruction and death to the people of Ukraine\".\n\n\"You in Poland, you in Israel, you know from your history that freedom and independence must be fought for and defended. You know how important it is for a democracy to defend itself.\n\n\"But we Germans, too, have learned the lessons of our history. Never again, which means that there must be no criminal war of aggression like Russia's against Ukraine in Europe.\"\n\nMr Steinmeier stressed this meant Germany and other Western nations would \"stand firmly on the side of Ukraine\".\n\nIt was the first time that a German head of state has been asked to speak at an anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.\n\nUnlike counterparts in other Western countries, German leaders had somewhat strained relations with Ukraine's authorities during the first few weeks of the Russian invasion, with senior officials in Kyiv openly criticising them for refusing to send modern weapons.\n\nIt was even reported that Mr Steinmeier was snubbed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last year, when he wanted to visit the Ukrainian capital together with other Western leaders.\n\nBut Germany is now seen as being at the forefront of Ukraine's fight with the invading forces.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

A video, shared online in the hours following Nahel's death, showed two police officers trying to stop the vehicle and one pointing his weapon at the driver.\n\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot has since been charged with voluntary homicide and apologised to the family. His lawyer said he is devastated.\n\nNahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop.\n\nMore widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force.

the Autism in The Air event with her son Haydn\n\nFamilies with autistic children have said free try-before-you-fly events at George Best Belfast City Airport have reassured them about travel plans.\n\nAutism In The Air, which is run through Queen's University Belfast (QUB), lets families experience the sights and sounds of a busy airport scenario.\n\nCatherine McNerlin's son Haydn was diagnosed with autism two years ago.\n\nShe told BBC News NI a twice postponed holiday can go ahead after their visit to the airport last weekend.\n\nMs McNerlin said they had postponed a family holiday two years in a row fearing five-year-old Haydn might struggle with big crowds, long queues and loud noises.\n\n\"Haydn is hyper sensitive and not good with change, he needs constant routine and uses a visual support board to transition throughout his day,\" Ms McNerlin told BBC News NI.\n\nDr Nichola Booth, a lecturer in behaviour analysis and autism at QUB, believes giving children on the autism spectrum an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the process of air travel is beneficial for them and their parents or guardians.\n\n\"What we noticed was that a lot of families of autistic children and young people were finding that going on holiday was a distressing experience,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"Some actually avoided going on holiday altogether because of the unknown situation of an airport with all the crowds and the unfamiliar sounds associated with them.\"\n\nDr Nichola Booth (pictured far right) with duty manager Bill Doole (far left) and support staff at George Best Belfast City Airport\n\nDr Booth said the scheme could help pinpoint any potential issues the child might experience during their time at the airport or on the plane and parents could then have a plan in place.\n\n\"Families really do benefit from this trial experience so that they can be less apprehensive about travelling in the future,\" Dr Booth said.\n\nAt the most recent event, 10 families got to experience busy check-in desks, go through mock airport security, wait at a departure gate and even get to board a grounded plane.\n\nMs McNerlin said she was overjoyed with how well Haydn's experience was at the airport, so much so that they were now planning to go on their long-overdue holiday.\n\n\"Haydn is now excited to go on the holiday, he got the opportunity to repeat things he was unsure about on the plane and now has a greater understanding of airports,\" she said.\n\n\"Before the event he had only ever seen airports through pictures at school or videos on TV or YouTube and didn't understand about them fully until he actually entered the building.\n\n\"Autism In The Air has completely turned around his whole way of thinking about them, we're now heading

Cunningham's 13-year-old son, Ethan, is autistic and is about to head off with his friends on a Boys' Brigade (BB) trip to London.\n\nMs Cunningham said she was quite apprehensive about her young son flying without her for the first time, but said she knew he would be in capable hands.\n\n\"The BB leaders are all fantastic with Ethan and one of the leaders going has a brother who is autistic so is great with Ethan as well,\" she said.\n\nMs Cunningham signed herself and Ethan up for the Autism In The Air event to allow him an opportunity to experience what it would be like going through a busy airport.\n\n\"Airports are so big and there are just so many people everywhere and I would just be worried about how he would cope sometimes,\" Ms Cunningham said.\n\n\"This was just a way to put my mind at ease because I know he wouldn't be used to it,\" she said.\n\n\"As a parent you do worry, so it was a great way for him to see what it was like and I could then flag to his BB leaders about any potential issues that he had on the trial run.\"\n\nZoe Ferguson's 3-year-old son, Rex, does not cope well in crowd spaces and she worries how he will feel in a busy airport\n\nZoe Ferguson's three-year-old son, Rex, is non-verbal and is currently being assessed for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\nMs Ferguson said she had not been on a plane with Rex since he was a baby, and was apprehensive about the prospect of the potential lengthy waits when it comes to airports.\n\nShe was also nervous about how well he would cope in crowded spaces and attended the event to reassure her about them flying together.\n\nRex Ferguson got to sit on a grounded airplane as part of the Autism In The Air Event\n\n\"He is not one to sit still and, like any three-year-old, it's a handful to try and keep him occupied,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\n\"If it didn't go well on the trial run, we probably wouldn't have travelled through an airport again until he was much older.\n\n\"We probably would rather go on a boat or go somewhere in the car instead if we wanted to head off somewhere.\n\n\"But I was very pleased with how well he did and it was great preparation for him for when we do fly in

cluster bombs, which have a record of killing civilians.\n\nThe president said it had taken him \"a while to be convinced to do it\", but he had acted because \"the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\".\n\nBut the UK's PM suggested the country \"discourages\" the use of cluster bombs, while Spain criticised the decision.\n\nWhen asked about his position on the US decision, Rishi Sunak highlighted the UK was one of 123 countries that had signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use.\n\nSpain's Defence Minister Margarita Robles told reporters her country had a \"firm commitment\" that certain weapons and bombs could not be sent to Ukraine.\n\n\"No to cluster bombs and yes to the legitimate defence of Ukraine, which we understand should not be carried out with cluster bombs,\" she said.\n\nBut Germany, which is a signatory of the treaty, said that while it would not provide such weapons to Ukraine it understood the American position.\n\n\"We're certain that our US friends didn't take the decision about supplying such ammunition lightly,\" German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told reporters in Berlin.\n\nMr Biden told CNN in an interview on Friday that he had spoken to allies about the decision, which was announced ahead of a Nato summit in Lithuania next week.\n\nThe US, Ukraine and Russia have not signed up to the convention, and both Moscow and Kyiv have used cluster bombs during the war.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Friday's daily White House briefing that officials \"recognise the cluster munitions create a risk of civilian harm\" from unexploded bombs.\n\nBut he said Ukraine was running out of artillery and needed \"a bridge of supplies\" while the US ramps up domestic production.\n\n\"We will not leave Ukraine defenceless at any point in this conflict period,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's defence minister has given assurances the cluster bombs would not be used in urban areas and only to break through enemy defence lines.\n\nThe munitions have caused controversy over their failure - or dud - rate, meaning unexploded small bombs can linger on the ground for years and indiscriminately detonate later on.\n\nMr Sullivan told reporters the American cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine were far safer than those he said were already being used by Russia in the conflict.\n\nHe told reporters the US ones have a dud rate of less than 2.5%, while Russia's have a dud rate of between 30-40%, he said.\n\nMr Biden's move will bypass US law prohibiting the production, use or transfer of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1%.\n\nEarly on in the war, when the White House was asked about allegations that Russia was using cluster and vacuum bombs, the then-press secretary said it would be a potential \"war crime\" if true.\n\nThere has been a mixed reaction among the US president's Democratic Party, more than a dozen of whom have spoken out against the plan.\n\nHuman rights groups also criticised the decision, with Amnesty International saying cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".\n\nThe US Cluster Munition Coalition, which is part of an international civil society campaign working to eradicate the weapons, said they would cause \"greater suffering, today and for decades to come\".\n\nThe UN human rights office has also been critical, with a representative saying \"the use of such munitions should stop immediately and not be used in any place\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA spokesperson for Russia's defence ministry described the move as an \"act of desperation\" and \"evidence of impotence in the face of the failure of the much publicised Ukrainian 'counteroffensive'.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously accused the US and its allies of fighting an expanding proxy war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US president for \"a timely, broad and much-needed\" military aid package worth $800m (\u00a3626m).\n\nHe tweeted that it would \"bring Ukraine closer to victory over the enemy, and democracy to victory over dictatorship\".\n\nUkraine's counter-offensive, which began last month, is grinding on in the eastern Donetsk and south-eastern Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny said the campaign had been hampered by a lack of adequate firepower, and expressed frustration with the slow deliveries of weapons promised by the West.", "The British have a love-hate relationship with the NHS.\n\nAccording to researchers at the King's Fund, the public gave the NHS its worst rating since records began 40 years ago. Just 29% said they were satisfied with the NHS in 2022.\n\nAnd yet we still love it. A whopping 90% of the public agrees the service should be free and available to everyone.\n\nBut with more than seven million people on waiting lists, almost everyone knows someone who isn't getting the care they need.\n\nAs the NHS approaches its 75th anniversary, politicians are falling over themselves to praise the service.\n\nBut when the cameras aren't rolling, the message you hear can be a very different one. Just like us, politicians have a love-hate relationship with the NHS.\n\n\"The whole system is paralysed and not improving - all the progress is going backwards.\" That's not the kind of thing you're likely to hear a minister say in public but it is the candid verdict of a former health minister talking privately.\n\nThey say the NHS chief executive has become the \"rationer-in-chief\" tasked with \"spreading the jam more and more thinly\" as the demand for care races ahead of what's available.\n\nAnother Conservative former minister tells me the \"National Health Service is an oxymoron\", a contradiction, because \"the leadership is incredibly patchy and outcomes are mixed\".\n\nFor Labour, a source says there is increasing \"anxiety and jeopardy\" about the future of the service and \"it really is a case of change or die\".\n\nYou'd be hard pressed to find a politician who would admit that services are being rationed but in off-the-record conversations that word comes up again and again.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Are you in a parallel universe on economy and NHS? - PM asked\n\nOne of the former ministers says \"people have to understand that there is rationing according to wait\" - saying that is the \"trade-off\" with the traditional model.\n\nA former government adviser says \"people know there is rationing - the service is pretty good when you get it - but you might not\".\n\nYou won't find health rationing on any political leaflet or Facebook ad.\n\nBut the public's attachment to the concept of the NHS remains extremely strong. Before and after the pandemic voters are in no mood for a discussion about changing its core principles - despite all the problems.\n\nThe former government health adviser tells me that any serious conversation about fundamental change is nigh on impossible.\n\n\"Any sophisticated Tory politician knows they'd sign their own death warrant\" if they raised the prospect of a wholesale change, they say.\n\nRemember Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's proposal to fine patients if they missed a GP appointment? It was ditched almost as soon as it was suggested.\n\nAnother former official describes the public's strong emotional connection to the idea of the institution itself, saying: \"It's like your family. I'll moan and moan and moan about it, but if someone else from outside has a go at them, I'll have them on toast. It's like criticising your football team - they can naff off!\"\n\nPlenty of politicians talk about reforms to the service - whether that is working with the private sector or this week's workforce plan. But whether it is required or not, it is almost unthinkable now that any mainstream politician would argue for a sweeping change to the whole system.\n\nOf course, that has an impact on what governments choose to do to try and improve the service, which might not be the most effective long-term focus.\n\nOne former official suggests: \"Politicians want solutions with easy metrics like cutting waiting lists.\n\n\"If you do cut them in the short term, that just means more operations, it doesn't address stopping people being ill in the first place.\"\n\nA former minister says rather than go for bold reforms after the pandemic \"we have gone straight back to the voodoo land of heroic pointless commitments that will never get met because as a country we are so ill\".\n\nAnother suggests ministers are actually scared of telling the public hard truths about increasing cost pressures in the health service. \"The public has unrealistic expectations of what we can deliver - the government is frightened of that,\" they say.\n\nAnd as we've talked about many times here and on the show, unless and until governments confront the aching gaps in care for the elderly and vulnerable, the rest of the health service has to absorb the costly consequences of social care system that to a large extent just doesn't work.\n\nOne of the former ministers I've spoken to is intensely frustrated that it is so hard to have a full conversation about the NHS, saying that \"it's a political problem, not a resources problem. Our politicians just aren't finding the space\" to talk about really bold changes.\n\nOne former adviser agrees, saying \"everyone of all stripes is scared to take it on\".\n\nYet the fact politicians find it almost impossible to talk about alternatives is also a tribute to the longevity of the NHS and the public's belief in it.\n\nThe former adviser suggests that while people have to wait and outcomes vary \"as a system it is extraordinarily fair and that has to be worth something\".\n\nLove it and hate it.

They cannot remember her now. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nWhen British special forces raided a family home in Afghanistan in 2012, they killed two young parents and gravely wounded their infant sons. A BBC investigation has revealed that special forces command didn't refer the incident to military police and it was never investigated, until now. In Afghanistan, a family is still trying to heal.\n\nLate on the evening of 6 August 2012, in the courtyard of a family home in Afghanistan, Abdul Aziz Uzbakzai sat down for the last dinner he would ever have with his son. At the table were Abdul Aziz and his wife, four of their five children, and two of their young grandchildren. It was the 18th night of Ramadan, the holy month when Muslims fast. The family lived together in a modest home in a village called Shesh Aba in Nimruz province.\n\nThat day had begun like any other - a shared pre-dawn breakfast, before sunrise brought the fasting hours and family members went to work. Abdul Aziz's eldest son, Hussain, opened the small grocery shop he ran. Hussain's wife Ruqqia cared for their two young boys and began her work in the home. A goat was slaughtered by a neighbour in anticipation of evening meals that would break the day's fast.\n\nThe only thing out of the ordinary, according to the family's account, was the arrival of two unknown male visitors. In rural Afghanistan, it is not uncommon to receive unexpected guests, and tradition dictates that they are shown hospitality. But Abdul Aziz felt himself becoming wary of the two men, he said, and he called Hussain to close the shop early and come home.\n\nAfter sunset, the two guests were given food and ate separately and they left without incident at 10pm, Abdul Aziz said. It was a hot summer night in Shesh Aba, so the family ate outside. At the end of the meal, Abdul Aziz stood up and said he was tired and would go to bed. He said \"Goodnight Hussain Jan\" - a term of loving affection - to his son, \"Goodnight daughter\" to Ruqqia, and \"Goodnight boys\" to the boys.\n\nAbdul Aziz at the family home in Shesh Aba. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nThe boys were young then - Imran three and his brother Bilal just one and a half. They do not remember anything now about what would unfold later that night, and the family has tried to shield them in the decade since from the worst of the horror. They know that before bedtime, their father had pulled their mattresses out into the courtyard, because the heat had made their shared room stifling, and that they had fallen asleep with their parents, for the last time, under the stars.\n\nBy that point, in 2012, coalition forces had been waging war in Afghanistan for a little over a decade. Elite special forces units from leading coalition countries were regularly carrying out so-called \"Deliberate Detention Operations\", also known as \"Kill/Capture missions\". Troops typically flew in by helicopter after dark and launched fast-moving assaults against suspected Taliban targets. For the UK, these night-time raids were usually executed by the SAS or SBS, the highly-respected special forces units of the British Army and Royal Navy.\n\nBut unknown to the British public at that time, SAS operatives were already suspected at the highest levels of UK Special Forces of illegally killing Afghan men who had surrendered and been detained, and later covering up the killings with fabricated reports. A BBC Panorama investigation published earlier this year revealed that one SAS squadron killed 54 people in suspicious circumstances in one six-month tour. The pattern led one of the highest-ranking special forces officers in the UK to warn in a secret memo to the head of special forces that there could be a \"deliberate policy\" in effect to kill detainees, \"even when they did not pose a threat\".\n\nOne of these \"Kill/Capture\" raids was about to be executed on Abdul Aziz's family home. At about 3am, British military helicopters descended through the dark sky over Nimruz and landed outside the village. Special forces operatives dropped to the ground and moved towards where the family were sleeping. Abdul Aziz was woken by the first gunshots, and within minutes foreign soldiers were in his room, he said, pushing him on the ground, handcuffing and blindfolding him.\n\n\"I pleaded with them to let me go to where my son and daughter-in-law and their children were sleeping,\" Abdul Aziz said. \"I could hear my two daughters screaming and pleading for help. No one was helping them. I could not do anything for my children.\"\n\nThe family lives in a small village made up of traditional mud homes, in Nimruz province. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nChaos had descended on the rural family home. According to his account, Abdul Aziz was blindfolded, beaten and interrogated. The foreign soldiers asked him about the visitors who came to the house earlier that day, he said. He would be kept inside, blindfolded, for the duration of the raid.\n\nThe special forces operatives had also gone to the house next door, where a widower called Lal Mohammad lived with his six sons and three daughters. One of his sons, Mohammad Mohammad, who was 12 at the time, told the BBC that he and his brothers were brought outside and detained by the assault team. He was blindfolded and - possibly because of his young age - taken separately to Hussain's home and held there for the rest of the raid.\n\nIt was only after the troops left the village, hours later, that Abdul Aziz was able to take off his blindfold and go out into the morning light to the place where Hussain and Ruqqia and the boys had been sleeping. \"There was blood everywhere\", he said, \"blood soaked into the sheets and the mattresses.\" According to members of both families who saw Hussain and Ruqqia's bodies, both had been shot in the head. Imran and Bilal's bloody bedclothes lay there, but the boys were gone.\n\nMohammad Mohammad ran back next door to his family home, where he had last seen his older brothers detained by the soldiers. He found Mohammad Wali, who was 26, and Mohammad Juma, who was 28, inside the home, dead with gunshot wounds to the head, he said. Other family members said that the two were shot at close range in the head, and an image of Mohammad Wali's body seen by the BBC appears to show a head wound.\n\nMohammad Mohammad's account appears to mirror the pattern of killings that had already raised suspicions among senior special forces officers.\n\n\"I swear to God, my brothers were farmers,\" he said. \"They worked from dawn until night. They were neither with the Taliban nor with the government. They were killed for no reason.\"\n\nAccording to the accounts of Abdul Aziz and other family members who saw Hussain and Ruqqia's bodies, their eyes were closed and their jaws had been bound shut with cloth tied under the jaw and around the head, maybe to allow the assault team to accurately photograph their faces - a standard procedure after a fatal shooting.\n\nThe young parents appeared to have been killed in their bed, the family said. It was not clear if they had woken up before they died. At first, the family assumed Imran and Bilal were dead too. But the boys had been airlifted out with the special forces, one-year-old Bilal with bullet wounds to his face and shoulder, three-year-old Imran with a gunshot wound in his abdomen, fighting for his young life.\n\nIn the aftermath of the raid, a British military commander had a decision to make. Under UK law, commanders are obliged to inform military police if there is any possibility that a Schedule 2 offence has been committed by a person under their command. Schedule 2 offences are serious offences like unlawful killing and grievous bodily harm. The guidance for commanding officers says that the circumstances must only \"indicate to a reasonable person that a Schedule 2 offence may have been committed\" in order to legally oblige them to refer the incident to the military police. It is considered a low bar.\n\nIn Shesh Aba, a woman was among the dead and two infant boys had been shot. An Afghan newswire report published the day of the raid quoted the local governor as saying that the foreign forces had \"killed and wounded six civilians\", including \"two children\". A former investigator from the Royal Military Police told the BBC that, based on the available information, there was \"no question in my mind that this incident should have been referred to military police\".\n\nBut the BBC has discovered that the raid was never referred to military police and never investigated by anyone outside of UK Special Forces. The Royal Military Police (RMP) told us that they did not appear to have been informed of the Shesh Aba raid at the time, and are now reviewing the incident \"as a direct result\" of our inquiries.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that British forces were involved in the raid and that a Serious Incident Review, or SIR (an internal review undertaken automatically after an operation goes wrong in a serious way) had been carried out, but that the commanding officer had decided against referring the incident to military police.\n\nThe MoD said: \"There is a comprehensive MOD policy in place for actions to be taken in the event of possible civilian casualties.\n\n\"Following a review by senior Army lawyers, it was decided by the Commanding Officer, in accordance with the Armed Forces Act 2006 and MoD policy, that the circumstances did not require a referral to the Service Police.\"\n\nGeneral Sir Mark Carleton-Smith was head of UK Special Forces at the time of the Shesh Aba raid in 2012.\n\nThe BBC asked both the MoD and RMP to reveal the rank of the commanding officer who made the decision, but both declined to say. The BBC has obtained a secret internal special forces document laying out the protocol for deciding on referrals to the military police. It appears to show that once an SIR has been completed, it has to go to the Director Special Forces - the highest-ranking special forces officer in the UK - for a decision on whether to refer the incident.\n\nDirector Special Forces at the time of the Shesh Aba raid was General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, who went on to become the head of the British Army, before stepping down earlier this year. Asked by the BBC about the Shesha Aba raid, General Carleton-Smith said he could not recall whether he was briefed on the \"specific tactical detail of the operation\", but that he was in no doubt he would have been \"guided by the advice of the in-theatre commanders\", as well as the legal judgement of a senior Army lawyer that no referral to military police was necessary.\n\nHe said the recommendation to him at the time from the commanding officer in Afghanistan was that there was no evidence of a criminal offence, that the Rules of Engagement hadn't been broken, and that \"the circumstances of the operation justified the lethal use of force\". He added: \"And I certainly never saw or read any evidence or advice that suggested unlawful behaviour\".\n\nGeneral Carleton-Smith told the BBC it remains his view that \"the Rules of Engagement were correctly observed despite the occasionally tragic outcomes that are sadly inevitable during war\".\n\nThe Rules of Engagement that applied to this raid dictated that lethal force could only have been used against someone who posed an imminent threat to life. There has been no suggestion from the Ministry of Defence that any weapons were found at Hussain and Ruqqia's home or that they were armed when they were shot.\n\nImran and Bilal play marbles in the courtyard, a few feet from a mulberry tree planted in the spot where their parents were killed. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nSIR reports were intended in part to help commanding officers make a decision about whether a referral to military police was necessary. But a former senior RMP officer who served at the time of the raid in Shesh Aba, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said there were \"serious problems\" across the Armed Forces with the use of the reports.\n\n\"Instead of getting to the bottom of what happened and correcting any criminal behaviour, SIRs became a way of cleansing an incident of any wrongdoing,\" he said. \"Some senior officers were using SIRs as a tool to prevent scrutiny. It seemed they were deciding on non-referral and then writing the SIR to justify the decision.\"\n\nThe problem was \"widespread\", the senior officer said, but UK Special Forces was \"notable in its lack of referrals\". The BBC has identified at least three other occasions when an SIR was completed by UK Special Forces but not referred to the RMP. \"In Special Forces, it's easier to keep it 'in house',\" the former senior officer said. \"There's a lot less oversight.\"\n\nA former RMP investigator who spoke to the BBC said he was \"not surprised\" that the Shesha Aba raid was not referred. \"I'm afraid, given my experience of these kinds of cases, I'm not surprised that the commanding officer decided not to inform the police,\" he said. \"But it's clear it should have been looked into.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the RMP said that its current review, prompted by the BBC's inquiries, \"should in no way be taken as implying that the incident was unlawful or that the British Armed Forces had improperly failed to make the Service Police aware, although these are factors that will be considered by our review team as a matter of course\".\n\nThe MoD said that it was \"the long-standing policy of successive governments not to comment on matters relating to Special Forces\" and that all British military operations were \"conducted in accordance with UK and international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict\".\n\nThe BBC asked the MoD if anyone had ever been officially disciplined over the Shesh Aba raid, but they declined to respond.\n\nAs dawn broke over Nimruz that day, the helicopters that had brought the troops flew back to base bearing the wounded Imran and Bilal. The special forces had also taken Hussain's youngest brother, Rahmat Ullah, who was 12.\n\nRahmat had been detained during the raid and he had no idea what had happened. When his blindfold was finally removed, aboard the helicopter, he saw his young nephews. Imran was conscious, crying. \"He looked like he was in severe pain,\" Rahmat recalled. \"He asked me for water, but I didn't have any.\"\n\nThe boys were sent to separate military bases. The family was not allowed to go to where Imran was so, aged just three, he spent the first part of his recovery alone. Eventually he was transferred, and it fell to Abdul Aziz and their grandmother Mah Bibi to comfort the boys and try to explain that their parents were gone.\n\n\"They were just too small to understand,\" Abdul Aziz said. \"Imran would cry more, maybe because of the pain, but maybe because he could sense that his mother was no longer alive.\"\n\nImran stands by his parents' graves. \"I wish our mother and father were with us today,\" he said. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nAbdul Aziz was offered some compensation at the military hospital for the boys' injuries but he refused the money, he said. \"I refused to benefit from the murderers at that time, they had destroyed our world,\" he said.\n\nWhen the boys were discharged, their grandparents took them home to the village. They have lived there since, with their older sister Hajira, in the home where they were shot. They don't remember anything about that night, or the weeks that followed, but after they came home Imran began to scream in his sleep and sleepwalk outside during the night. \"I don't know why I do it,\" he said. \"I am asleep when it happens, and my grandfather or grandmother brings me home.\"\n\nImran and Bilal doing their homework together. The boys look out for one another, Abdul Aziz said. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nImran is 13 now. He has a long surgical scar down the front of his torso and a scar on the left of his belly, and more scar tissue across his lower back. He has bullet fragments inside his torso - including a large fragment embedded in his spine. \"Running causes me pain, and I feel pain in my stomach,\" he said, pointing gently to the scars on his belly and back. \"I also feel more pain in the winter and when the summer comes I'm relieved.\"\n\nBilal is 11. He has a scar on his face from a bullet that hit him millimetres from his left eye and a scar on his shoulder where another round hit him and left a bullet fragment inside his bone. He gets pain in his arm when he uses it a lot, he said, and the position of the scar on his face is a permanent reminder of how close he came to death.\n\nScars on Imran's abdomen show the damage from the bullet wound as well as his surgical incision. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nBoth boys have bullet fragments inside them. Imran has a large fragment lodged in his spine. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nThe boys go for a few hours in the mornings to a religious school, but there is no proper school nearby that they can attend for full time education. Imran enjoys the lessons, particularly reading. Bilal is less keen. \"I don't like school,\" he said, with a smile. He likes playing with his older brother. On a cool afternoon in October, the two of them played marbles in the courtyard of their home, and they looked as though they were in their own little world. A few feet away, there was a Mulberry tree in the place where their parents were killed. Either side of the Mulberry tree were two thin Jujube trees, planted by Imran and Bilal, for Mohammad Wali and Mohammad Juma, their neighbours who were killed.\n\nImran and Bilal do not talk much about their parents. They have no memory of Hussain and Ruqqia, so their loss is defined by a general sense of absence. \"I wish our mother and father were with us today,\" Imran said, \"so we could go to the city to walk around and enjoy ourselves, as other children can.\"\n\nThe family is poor, and the boys have had limited access to medical care since they were discharged a decade ago. Recently, they travelled to the trauma hospital in the city of Lashkar Gah, about six hours' drive from the village, for a medical examination arranged by the BBC. X-rays showed the bullet fragments still lodged in their bodies. It was the first time the boys had ever seen them. The doctors said that nothing could be done to safely remove the fragments from Imran's torso, so he will have to live with them. \"He is lucky to be alive,\" the surgeon said.\n\nAs the boys were examined, Abdul Aziz sat quietly alongside them and held their hands, just as he had sat with them 10 years ago, in another hospital, when they were much smaller, knowing that they were his responsibility now.\n\nImran sits in a hospital in Lashkar Gah, where the boys were examined in October.

Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nHussain and Ruqqia were married on a hot summer's day in 2006, in Zahedan, Iran, where Ruqqia's family lived. Excitement had been building in the village in Afghanistan, and when the appointed day came Abdul Aziz and about 100 members of the wider family set out across the border for the ceremony.\n\nWhen they returned a few days later with the new bride and groom, there were celebrations to rival the festival of Eid. Livestock was slaughtered to make rich meals for the family and their neighbours. Those who had new clothes wore them. Those who didn't have new clothes wore the best clothes they had. \"It was a joyous moment for everyone,\" Abdul Aziz recalled. \"From then on, I called Ruqqia my daughter.\"\n\nHussain opened a small grocery shop in the village. Ruqqia was a 'Hafiz Quran', a memoriser of the Muslim holy book, and she taught local children. Shortly after the wedding, their daughter Hajira was born, and then Imran, and a year and a half later Bilal. Hussain took on a new role as the head of the family and the financial provider. He doled out pocket money to his siblings, paid for their schooling and later their weddings. \"He was our strength and power,\" said his younger brother, Mansour. \"We didn't worry about a thing when he was alive.\"\n\nThe boys help with work in the fields. \"I am getting older, it is harder to work,\" Abdul Aziz said. Image: Julian Busch/BBC\n\nWhen Hussain was killed, it forced Abdul Aziz back to work. Now, at 55, he spends his days digging irrigation canals for 200 Afghani - less than \u00a32 - per day. He regrets turning down the offer of compensation for the boy's injuries. If it came again today he would accept. \"I am getting older, and it is harder to work and harder to feed the children,\" he said.\n\nAt one time, Abdul Aziz would set off every day after work, under the burning sun or through bracing cold, to the cemetery where his son and daughter-in-law are buried. Hussain's mother, Mah Bibi, often walked with him. Eventually, her sadness overtook her and became a depression that she has not recovered from, and now she cannot go as often. Abdul Aziz suffers too. He is physically tired. But every Friday he walks a kilometre along the dusty track that leads from the village to the graves. They lie in a small, walled off area of the cemetery reserved for those killed by the foreign soldiers. There are eight graves there in total. Two belong to Hussain and Ruqqia. Two to Mohammad Wali and Mohammed Juma.\n\nLast Friday, Abdul Aziz set out for his weekly visit. For half an hour, as the sun set, he sat still by the graves and said prayers for Hussain and for Ruqqia. He spoke to his son. \"I told him that I missed him, and that I could still remember him when he was just a little boy,\" Abdul Aziz said afterwards. He had not uttered a word by the grave. \"I do not speak to him aloud,\" he said. \"I speak to him in my heart.\"\n\nKiyya Baloch and Ahmad Naveed Nazari contributed to this report\n\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\n\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\n\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\n\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

Scientists believe it could be used to correct many inherited diseases.\n\nIt is controversial, though, because it raises the possibility of making permanent changes to a person's genetic make-up that will be passed down to their offspring.\n\nThe world's leading scientists in the field were stunned when Dr He Jiankui, from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, claimed five years ago that he had created the world's first gene-edited babies - twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana.\n\nThe girls' DNA had been altered while they were at an early embryonic stage in a way that Dr He claimed would make them resistant to HIV infection.\n\nHe was fined and sentenced to three years in prison in 2019. No-one, other than Dr He, has had access to the twins. But at a recent scientific meeting, he said they were in good health.\n\nUpon his release, it emerged last month that he was planning to set up a clinic in Hong Kong to research using gene editing to develop a treatment for children with a rare inherited muscular disorder, called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Immigration officials announced that they had rescinded his visa after they discovered he had a criminal record.\n\nThe new rules close the loopholes that enabled Dr He to evade regulations, which previously only applied to experiments on human beings in hospitals, for example for drug trials. The updated regulations cover all research institutions and everything relating to humans, including work on tissues, organs and embryonic cells.\n\nDr He Jiankui served a three-year prison sentence following claims that he created the world's first gene-edited children five years ago.\n\nThe summit organiser, Prof Robin Llovell-Badge, from the Crick Institute, where the meeting is being held, said he was concerned that there was still too much secrecy in Chinese research.\n\n''I understand why China wants to be leaders in technology, but there are some areas that require special attention and gene editing is one of them,\" he said.\n\n''It has to be done properly and with the appropriate governance and oversight, and I'm concerned that they are not there yet.''\n\nSpeaking at the summit, Dr Yangin Peng, of the Chinese Academy of Science, said the government has \"accelerated\" laws and regulations in gene editing.\n\n\"China has considerably tightened its legislation and regulations,\" he said. \"Permanent, inherited changes are banned, governance has adopted a precautionary approach and our laws are in line with international rules.\"\n\nDr Francoise Baylis, a Canadian bioethicist from Dalhousie University, said she wanted more details of the updates to China's rules.\n\n''I saw [that in the updated rules] research should be in line with ethical principles. I would want to know which ethical principles, where they are set out and whether they are open to questioning,'' she said.\n\nShe added that China was not alone in grappling with how to regulate the private sector.\n\n''We have similar issues in North America, so I think it is wrong to focus on China,'' she said.\n\nDr Piers Millett, of the International Biosafety and Biosecurity Initiative, based in Washington, acknowledged that: ''China is probably leading the way in revising the rules in this area.''\n\nGene editing enables precise genetic changes to be made at the embryonic stage\n\nMany scientists have wondered how Dr He could be allowed to return to clinical research after serving time in prison.\n\n\"I, like many people, had been wondering whether there had been an individual or institution in China that had been backing or protecting He Jiankui,\" said Dr Zhang.\n\nBut she said she now thought that \"we are looking at a simple case of regulatory negligence\".\n\nThat led her to believe that \"without getting clarifications on Dr He's case, the recent talk of good governance is hypocritical\".\n\n\"I worry less about what He Jiankui is up to, and more about the Chinese authorities are doing,\" she said.", "The \u00a32 cap on bus fares in England has been extended again until the end of October, the government has announced.\n\nThe cap, which applies to more than 130 bus operators outside of London, will then rise in November to \u00a32.50 for 12 months, before prices are reviewed.\n\nThe current limit on fares has now been extended twice after warnings hundreds of services could be cut without it.\n\nIts aim is to ease the cost of living pressures on passengers but also to encourage people to use buses.\n\nBus operators have still not seen the same number of passengers return to using services as before the Covid pandemic, with levels recovering to around 85 to 90%, according to the Department for Transport.\n\nThe Confederation of Passenger Transport, which is the trade association for the UK's bus and coach sector, welcomed the extra funding for the scheme and said it would help operators and councils to \"promote and grow services with greater confidence\".\n\nBut Graham Vidler, chief executive of the body, warned the funding and cap extension would \"not save every service in every part of the country\".\n\nThe trade association has repeatedly claimed that up to 15% of services could be scrapped without further funding for the sector. It has said if the government is \"really serious\" about levelling up, then ministers need to \"back our buses for the long term\".\n\nTravel is one of the main costs to come out of household budgets, which have been squeezed in recent months by the rise in fuel, food and energy prices.\n\nPrices for all goods are rising and inflation, which is the rate at which prices go up, is at 10.1%, meaning items are more than 10% more expensive than they were a year ago on average.\n\nNorman Baker, of the Campaign for Better Transport, urged the government to advertise the bus fare cap to attract people who do not usually use buses in order to grow passenger numbers.\n\n\"The huge success of the scheme proves that by making public transport more affordable, more people will use it and revenue can be increased,\" he added.\n\nSome of the longest routes which the cap applies to include:\n\nSome people have gone viral on social media after travelling up and down the UK using \u00a32 bus tickets.\n\nExtending the current cap until the end of October and then subsiding fares at \u00a32.50 until November 2024 will cost \u00a3200m, the government said.\n\nAs well as releasing cash to keep the cap in place, the Department for Transport said it would provide \u00a3300m to councils and operators until 2025 to protect routes that passengers rely on for work, education and medical appointments, and to improve infrastructure.\n\nAre you a user of buses and will benefit from this cap being extended?\n\nThe government said continuing to cap fares would particularly benefit people on lower incomes who it said take three times as many bus trips than those on higher incomes.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said the reason for extending the scheme was due to bus travel being \"the most popular form of public transport\", with millions of people relying on them.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak added: \"By extending the \u00a32 fare cap, we're making sure bus travel remains accessible and affordable for everyone, while helping to ease cost of living pressures.\"\n\nThe government said to help support the bus industry, it has provided more than \u00a32bn in funding to recover from the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, ministers published a National Bus Strategy, involving hundreds of miles of new bus lanes and price caps on tickets which would make buses cheaper and easier to use.\n\nBut the Transport committee of MPs, whose job is to scrutinise the Department for Transport, said in a report released in March that while many of the strategy's ideas \"were on the right track\", progress in implementing them had \"sometimes been too slow, and in some cases, too piecemeal\".\n\nIt said without further rounds of funding for councils and bus companies, the plans would \"barely scratch the surface\".", "The home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was searched for two days at the start of March\n\nPolice had to wait two weeks before they were given permission to raid the home of Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, it has emerged.\n\nThe Crown Office was told on 20 March that Police Scotland wanted a search warrant.\n\nIt was not until 3 April - a week after the SNP leadership contest ended - that the application for a warrant was approved by a sheriff.\n\nOfficers searched the home of the former first minister two days later.\n\nDetails were released by Police Scotland in response to a Freedom of Information Request (FOI) by the Scottish Conservatives that was first reported by the Scottish Sun.\n\nSources close to the inquiry have denied that there was an undue delay.\n\nBut opposition parties said the revelation would \"raise eyebrows\" and questioned the role of Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, who heads the Crown Office but is also a Scottish government minister.\n\nMs Bain did not answer when she was asked by Sky News whether the warrant had been deliberately delayed.\n\nA spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"In all matters, Scotland's prosecutors act independently of political pressure or interference.\"It is standard that any case regarding politicians is dealt with by prosecutors without the involvement of the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General.\"\n\nBBC Scotland understands that a draft search warrant was submitted by the police which the fiscal then discussed with officers before its contents were finalised.\n\nThe warrant, which is reported to have included a long list of items the police wanted to seize, was then signed by a sheriff on the same day it was finished.\n\nMr Murrell, who had quit as the SNP's chief executive on 18 March, was arrested when officers investigating the party's finances arrived at the Glasgow home he shares with Ms Sturgeon early on the morning of 5 April.\n\nSeveral boxes of evidence were removed from the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh\n\nPolice spent two days searching the house, with several boxes of evidence being removed. Mr Murrell was released without charge pending further investigations.\n\nThe SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh was also searched on 5 April and a luxury motorhome that sells for about \u00a3110,000 was seized from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline.\n\nColin Beattie, who was the party's treasurer at the time, was arrested on 18 April before also being released without charge while further inquiries were carried out. He subsequently quit as treasurer.\n\nThe contest to succeed Ms Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister had ended on 27 March when Humza Yousaf, who was the party hierarchy's preferred candidate, narrowly defeated Kate Forbes.\n\nNewspaper reports earlier this year claimed that some people within Police Scotland were frustrated by the direction they were being given by the Crown Office on the SNP investigation.\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay told BBC Scotland: \"There has been this continual sense of something not feeling quite right and of some frustration being expressed not by journalists, not by politicians, but by police officers and this latest revelation perhaps only feeds into that sense.\n\n\"From what I understand the Crown Office is suggesting this was perfectly regular and routine, but the entire investigation is so sensitive and is subject to a huge amount of speculation and the more transparency there is around it the better.\"\n\nMr Findlay said the case also raised \"fundamental questions\" about the role of the Lord Advocate, who heads the independent prosecution service while also sitting as a minister in Scottish government cabinet meetings.\n\nHe added: \"It doesn't feel appropriate. And that separation needs to happen.\"\n\nJackie Baillie, the deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said the two-week delay was a \"very interesting revelation that will lead to raised eyebrows across Scotland\".\n\nShe added: \"While I accept that the Lord Advocate may not have had a direct influence on the timing, this story underlines why we need to have a serious discussion about separating the role of the Lord Advocate to ensure that no perception of conflict of interest can ever occur.\"\n\nAlba MP Kenny MacAskill, who served as justice secretary in the SNP government led by Alex Salmond, called for a judge-led inquiry into the Crown Office's role in the granting of the warrant to search Ms Sturgeon's house and the SNP HQ.\n\nHe said this would \"reassure the public that the decisions taken by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service have not been influenced by political considerations\".\n\nPrivately, prosecutors and police are deeply frustrated by the latest headlines and vehemently deny that the SNP's leadership contest played any part in the timing of the searches.\n\nSome legal figures describe the two-week process to secure search warrants as unusually long.\n\nA senior lawyer who has worked with the Crown Office in the past said: \"It all depends on why it took two weeks. If it was for operational reasons, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n\"If it was for further inquiries, there's nothing wrong with that. If it was for political reasons, to delay things, there's a lot wrong with that.\"\n\nOne source close to the inquiry said: \"The concept that there was a delay is misplaced. The decision was taken by a procurator fiscal with no political affiliation.\"\n\nGiven the apparent complexity of the investigation and the fact that the stakes are so high, it would be astonishing if prosecutors were not taking their time and the greatest of care.\n\nInevitably, in something like this, it's a case of \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\".\n\nPolice launched their Operation Branchform investigation almost two years ago after receiving complaints about how a total of \u00a3666,953 donated to the SNP by activists was used.\n\nThe party pledged to spend the funds on a future independence referendum. Questions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nLast year it emerged Mr Murrell gave a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issue after the last election.\n\nThe party had repaid about half of the money by October of that year. It still owes money to its former chief executive, but has not said how much.\n\nMs Sturgeon has previously said the police investigation played no part in her decision to announce on 15 February that she was standing down as SNP leader and first minister.\n\nShe also said the first she knew that the police wanted to search her home and arrest her husband was when detectives arrived on her doorstep.\n\nShe added: \"There are many questions that I would want to be able to answer and in the fullness of time I hope I will answer, but it would be wrong and inappropriate for me to go into any detail of what the police are currently investigating.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Video shows the moment four Americans were kidnapped in Mexico\n\nFour Americans were kidnapped by armed men last week soon after crossing into the Mexican border city of Matamoros. Two of them were killed and two survived the ordeal.\n\nFor now, the Mexican government remains tight-lipped about the motive for the attack. However, the attorney general's office in the state of Tamaulipas said the theory that this was a case of mistaken identity was \"strengthening\".\n\nOfficials wouldn't comment on two specific suggestions - that a drug gang had confused them either for US-based rivals, Haitian drug gang members or people smugglers. But they said there were multiple and \"diverse\" lines of investigation, and that none was being ruled out at this stage.\n\nMatamoros is caught between warring factions of the Gulf Cartel, as they battle for control of the so-called plazas - the drug smuggling routes north into the US.\n\nApparently unwitting, the group of friends from North Carolina drove their minivan straight into that maelstrom. Their ordeal lasted for four days.\n\nAs the US citizens were being moved between safehouses to prevent detection, the US Embassy issued a statement demanding their immediate release. For any Mexican cartel - or even a common criminal gang operating along the border - that will have spelt trouble.\n\nThe armed gang will have understood immediately that the full force of a joint operation by US and Mexican federal law enforcement was going to be turned in their direction. Had the motive been ransom, as is so often the case in Mexico, they will have realised it was now very unlikely to be paid.\n\nFar easier, then, to simply turn the Americans over and deflect some of the intense heat bearing down on their gang.\n\n\"My guess is that's the most reasonable explanation for what happened,\" says Mexican drug war analyst, Alejandro Hope. \"They might have had connections or contacts with local police and they just told their contacts where their safehouse was.\"\n\nKidnappings in Mexico are disturbingly common. Last year, Mexico reached the horrific figure of 100,000 people disappeared or missing in the country. Most kidnappings are carried out with complete impunity, particularly in the case of undocumented immigrants travelling north to the US.\n\nIn comparison, this case was resolved incredibly quickly. Some Mexicans voiced frustration on social media at the speed with which such crimes are resolved when foreigners are involved.\n\n\"In under a week. And the thousands and thousands of kidnapped Mexicans?\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\n\"That's not untrue,\" says Mr Hope. \"Mexican institutions have a limited set of capabilities. But if they focus those capabilities on specific cases, yes, they can solve them.\"\n\n\"It's about visibility and political impact,\" he says.\n\nClearly, in this instance, the political will in Mexico to find a solution couldn't have been higher.\n\nUS Ambassador Ken Salazar met Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to discuss the matter, and said the US State Department had \"no greater priority\" than the well-being of its citizens abroad.\n\nThe case was brought to an end within 24 hours.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Everything is just devastated,\" Italian NGO boss Stefano Rebora told the BBC.\n\nSouth African diplomat Clayson Monyela said all routes out of Khartoum - a city of six million people - were \"risky and dangerous\".\n\n\"The airport remains closed, the fighting continues,\" he told the BBC. He reiterated a call for a ceasefire to allow people to leave, and aid to enter.\n\nSudan was suffering an \"internet blackout\" with connectivity at 2% of ordinary levels, monitoring group NetBlocks said on Monday. In Khartoum, the internet has been down since Sunday night.\n\nMeanwhile, water and electricity have been restored to some parts of the capital, but not all of them.\n\nOne Nigerian student told the BBC: \"The taps are outside in the street and that's the scary part - sometimes we are going out to get water but there is shooting or explosions going on, so we just have to run there and get the water and come back.\"\n\nNumerous countries have evacuated their civilians - and thousands of other people have made risky escapes.\n\nMany of those who have left Khartoum have headed to other parts of the country where they have family ties - leaving parts of the city centre completely deserted.\n\nOthers have gone north to Egypt by bus, or headed south.\n\nOfficials in neighbouring South Sudan said the roughly 10,000 refugees who had arrived in recent days came from Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda - as well as from Sudan and South Sudan themselves.\n\nMultiple countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate diplomats and civilians from Khartoum.\n\nBy Monday about 1,100 European Union citizens had been taken out of Sudan, an EU diplomatic source told the BBC. The bloc believed about 1,700 EU citizens had been in Sudan when the fighting began.\n\nThe US said it had airlifted fewer than 100 people by helicopter on Sunday in a \"fast and clean\" operation. The American embassy in Khartoum is now closed, and a tweet on its official feed says it is not safe for the government to evacuate private US citizens.\n\nThe UK government airlifted British diplomats and their families out of the country. Foreign Minister James Cleverly said options to evacuate remaining Britons were \"severely limited\". Canada has evacuated its diplomatic staff.\n\nTurkey - a key player in Sudan - began evacuation efforts by road from the southern city of Wad Medani on Sunday, but plans from one site in Khartoum were postponed after a nearby explosion.\n\nMore than 150 people - mostly citizens of Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Pakistan and Canada - were evacuated by sea to Saudi Arabia.\n\nLong lines of UN vehicles and buses were seen leaving Khartoum on Sunday, heading east towards Port Sudan on the Red Sea and carrying \"citizens from all over the world\", a Sierra Leonean evacuee told AFP news agency.\n\nHowever many foreign students from Africa, Asia and the Middle East are among the foreigners still trapped in Khartoum.\n\nThe western region of Darfur - where the RSF first emerged - has also been badly affected by the fighting.\n\nThe UN has warned that up to 20,000 people - mostly women and children - have fled Sudan to seek safety in Chad, across the border from Darfur.\n\nHowever in other parts of the country, some semblance of normalcy has emerged.\n\nIn Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, there has been less gunfire and explosions than in previous days, possibly to allow civilians to leave. Heavy fighting outside the army headquarters has stopped.\n\nAs a result, for the first time since hostilities broke out more than a week ago, women and children have been out on the streets, visiting neighbours and going to markets, which still have some basic supplies such as oil and wheat. There are long queues outside the few bakeries that remain open.\n\nMore than 400 people have died in the conflict, and thousands have been injured, according to the latest tally from the World Health Organization. But it is feared the true toll is much higher.\n\nSeveral ceasefires that seemed to have been agreed were subsequently ignored - including a three-day pause to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Friday.\n\nThe UN's World Food Programme says the fighting could plunge millions more Sudanese into hunger in a country where a third of the population already struggles to get enough to eat.", "Kevin Spacey arrives at Southwark Court in London for the third day of his trial\n\nActor Kevin Spacey kissed a man twice and grabbed his crotch while telling his alleged victim to \"be cool\", a court in London has heard.\n\nThe man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleges he was approached by the actor after he accidentally let his dog out.\n\nHis police interview was played to jurors at Southwark Crown Court during the third day of Mr Spacey's trial.\n\nThe American actor is facing 12 charges, all of which he denies.\n\nThe accuser told police in the recording that he was working in a pub at the time when the actor came in with a small dog.\n\nHe said Mr Spacey sat by the sofa area and introduced himself.\n\nThe man later told the actor that there were \"very limited\" things to do in the area where they were and that he was meeting some friends at another pub after he finished work.\n\nThe man told the detective that Mr Spacey replied: \"Cool, I might see you down there\".\n\nWhen the man got to the other pub, he said he heard an American accent calling his name and looked up to see Mr Spacey.\n\nThe complainant then told the detective that he and others then went back to where Mr Spacey was staying for some drinks.\n\nIt was during the drinks that the complainant said he was looking for a coat in one of the cupboards, and remembered a \"little dog\" shooting out between his legs.\n\nThe man said he turned around, picked up the dog and put the animal back in the room.\n\nIt was then he alleged that the actor came towards him in a \"huggy motion\".\n\n\"We did an awkward man-hug... he hugged me, I did a sort of pat on the back type of thing.\n\n\"At that point he kissed my neck twice and grabbed my crotch. He said the words 'be cool, be cool' twice.\n\n\"I put my arm between us and pushed him against a wall. I said 'I am sorry, I don't bat for that team'.\"\n\nHe said Mr Spacey had a \"panicked\" look on his face and left the room.\n\nThe complainant said he then stood \"momentarily for a couple of seconds almost in disbelief that that happened\".\n\nHe left the property, and rang his father in a \"bit of a panicky state\".\n\nIn the police interview he told the detective he remembers thinking his father wouldn't believe him because it was April Fool's Day.\n\nWhen asked by the detective how the alleged incident made him feel, the man replied: \"It was unwanted. It shook me up.\"\n\nRecalling when Mr Spacey had met him and his friends at the pub, he told police the star joined his group and began drinking double Jack Daniels and colas while he had pints of Guinness.\n\nThe man said the actor became \"quite open\" with them, but began touching the legs of members of the group.\n\nHe said: \"There were a few moments where he had put his hand on your back, (or) pat you on the back, or put his hand on your knee or something.\n\n\"It was not anything that we thought too much about, just sort of moved to the side or moved his hands away.\"\n\nMr Spacey then allegedly told the group and others: \"If you want to carry on the party I have got drink, wine and beer back at the house and a few spliffs.\"\n\nMr Spacey is accused of one charge of sexual assault in relation to this complainant, which the actor denies.\n\nIn January, Mr Spacey - who is referred to in court proceedings by his full name, Kevin Spacey Fowler - pleaded not guilty to three counts of indecent assault, three counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.\n\nHe also previously denied four further charges of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.\n\nIt is these 12 charges which Mr Spacey is currently on trial for, brought by four men stretching from 2001 to 2013.\n\nAll four accusers are entitled to lifelong anonymity under the law.", "Damien Green visited Barry in his childhood and swam in sewage\n\nA senior Conservative MP said he swam in sewage when visiting south Wales as a child.\n\nAshford MP Damian Green, 67, said attitudes towards sewage spillages had changed in recent years.\n\nWelsh Water released sewage into rivers, lakes and the sea for almost 600,000 hours last year.\n\nEngland's water companies recently pledged \u00a310bn after apologising for \"not acting quickly enough\".\n\n\"I'm not denying its a big issue but it always has been.

Watch: Three takeaways from Trump's day in court\n\nDonald Trump's day in court was dramatic and historic - but what we learned about the criminal charges he faces seems unlikely to change minds.\n\nJust over two weeks ago, the former US president predicted he was soon to be charged by prosecutors in New York City. Speculation abounded, as everyone, including Mr Trump, waited to find out what was in the indictment.\n\nIt turned out, however, that the outlines of the case against him had already been widely discussed.\n\nThe 34-count indictment targeted the hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. There were no charges of criminal conspiracy. There were no new crimes unearthed by the grand jury that remained hidden until the indictment was concealed. There was no expansive case.\n\nThe cards were already on the table when Mr Trump woke up in Manhattan on Tuesday. The case is what we thought it was, even if some of the evidence of what prosecutors allege was a pattern of election influence was new.\n\nThis suggests that the battle lines that had been forming over the past few days will only harden as the case proceeds toward trial. Republicans, who had been fairly united in their defence of Mr Trump since he posted on social media that an indictment was looming, will stay unified.\n\nEven Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who voted to convict Mr Trump in his two impeachment trials, released a statement saying that Mr Bragg \"stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda\".\n\n\"The prosecutor's overreach sets a dangerous precedent for criminalising political opponents and damages the public's faith in our justice system,\" he said.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the courthouse for Donald Trump's arraignment\n\nDemocrats, at this point, may follow President Joe Biden's lead and keep silent about the case. They may prefer to avoid entanglement in a prosecution that at the moment could do more to rally the Republican base than damage the former president's political standing.\n\nMr Trump appeared stony-faced during his brief on-camera appearances at the courthouse where he pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him. But on his social media website, and in a slew of fundraising emails throughout the day, he seemed willing to press what he may perceive as his advantage.\n\nIt follows his repeated attacks on Mr Bragg and the New York City prosecution team - actions that prompted a warning from presiding Judge Juan Merchan against further inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nMr Trump has also questioned Mr Merchan's impartiality and called for the case to be moved out of Manhattan to Staten Island, where the jury pool could have more Trump supporters. His lawyers are also expected to file motions to get the charges dismissed before the case reaches trial.\n\nWhile Mr Trump may be already be dismissing the case as terminally weak, his legal jeopardy, however, does not begin and end in New York. A federal special counsel and a Georgia district attorney are pursuing their own investigations into the former president, and they can now bring charges without the history-making burden Mr Bragg confronted.\n\nThe US has had high-profile national legal dramas. It's had high-stakes political campaigns. Now the American public has both at the same time - with the prospect of more to come. The months ahead promise to be a jarring mix of legal manoeuvrings, court appearances and campaign events, as the former president navigates these most unusual waters.\n\nPerhaps, as America's first reality-show president, who has made a habit of upending political tradition and decorum for eight years and counting, such a spectacle should come as no surprise.\n\nJudge Merchan prohibited television cameras from filming Mr Trump's arraignment in order to prevent what he feared would be a circus environment.

Meanwhile, NHS junior doctors in England staged a four-day walkout over pay, which ended at 07:00 on Saturday.\n\nThe wave of industrial action affecting the UK in recent months has contributed to its lack of growth, the Office of National Statistics said this week.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt said it was important to avoid fuelling further inflation through pay rises. He said Britain had avoided recession this year \"so far\", and that he hoped to see faster growth and falling inflation in the months ahead.\n\nMeasures in his March Budget to help businesses recruit more staff and to increase investment, including an increase in childcare funding, should stimulate growth, he added.\n\nInvestor confidence in the UK was shaken last year during the short-lived government of prime minister Liz Truss, which saw Mr Kwarteng present an economic strategy that included major tax cuts without an explanation of how they would be funded.\n\nThe outlook for the UK, which relies heavily on financial services, could be clouded by current uncertainty in the banking sector, following the collapse of three US banks and UBS's emergency takeover of Credit Suisse.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt said the UK had \"a very robust, resilient banking system\", which was now in a much better position than it was before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"Am I confident in the resilience of our banking system, the second largest financial services centre in the world?' Yes, I am,\" he said.\n\nWhile the government is considering reforming some of the rules governing financial services, put in place after 2008, Mr Hunt said the plan was \"absolutely not to unlearn the lessons of the financial crisis\".\n\n\"We are looking at all of these things, but we're not going to do it in a way that rows back on any of the very important protections that we have in place,\" he said.\n\nBut he said the growth of the UK's tech and life sciences industries meant regulations needed to adapt.\n\n\"We have a lot of high growth companies in the UK, and they need to have banking services that suit their needs. And that's a difference from a decade ago,\" he said.", "Charles and Prince Harry pictured together in 2019\n\nKing Charles tried to stop the Duke of Sussex taking legal action against newspapers over alleged phone-hacking, court papers claim.\n\nIn a witness statement, Prince Harry said he was \"summoned to Buckingham Palace\" and told to drop the cases because of the effect on the family.\n\nThe duke is suing the publisher of the Sun, News Group Newspapers, over alleged unlawful information-gathering.\n\nBut NGN wants to stop his claim, saying he has run out of time to bring it.\n\nThe case is one of three major cases that Prince Harry has made against tabloid newspapers, all alleging unlawful information-gathering. The other cases concern the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail groups.\n\nPrince Harry accuses the Sun's journalists and private investigators working for them of illegal intrusion into his personal life, dating back to when he was a teenager.\n\nIn documents revealed at the High Court on Tuesday, Prince Harry claimed that Buckingham Palace and the newspaper group had struck a backroom deal - which is why he did not bring a claim earlier. He said he first became aware of the alleged deal in around 2012.\n\nHe said that under the deal, courtiers had secretly agreed that members of the Royal Family would put off legal claims, and the newspaper group promised to one day settle out-of-court, so as to spare the Royal Family embarrassment.\n\n\"The reason for this was to avoid the situation where a member of the Royal Family would have to sit in the witness box and recount the specific details of the private and highly-sensitive voicemails that had been intercepted.\"\n\nPrince Harry said courtiers were \"incredibly nervous\" about a repeat of the damaging disclosure of an intimate phone call between his father and Camilla, the Queen Consort, which had been intercepted and published at a time when King Charles was still married to Diana.\n\nNGN lawyers deny there was ever a secret agreement.\n\nAccording to the court documents, Prince Harry said that by 2018 he had felt \"frustrated that nothing had been resolved\" and wanted to \"force a resolution\" to the phone-hacking claims.\n\nHe said Queen Elizabeth II supported an attempt to hold the publisher to its word and agree a settlement, and she gave consent for royal staff to email the newspaper group and raise the prospect of involving lawyers.\n\nBut when he ultimately decided to sue in 2019, Prince Harry claimed his father then tried to stop him.\n\n\"I was summoned to Buckingham Palace and specifically told to drop the legal actions because they have an 'effect on all the family',\" said the duke.\n\n\"This was a direct request (or rather demand) from my father, Edward Young and my father's private secretary, Clive Alderton.\"\n\nPrince Harry's court papers also claim that his brother, Prince William, was paid a \"very large sum\" by the owners of the Sun newspaper to settle his own historical phone-hacking claims.\n\nThe payment was made in 2020 - but the documents do not disclose the amount Prince William settled for and do not have the details of what it related to.\n\nThe Prince of Wales' spokesman said he would not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nNGN has denied that any secret agreement existed, with Anthony Hudson KC saying the prince's claim was \"flatly inconsistent\" with other parts of his case and there was \"extreme vagueness\" surrounding the circumstances of the alleged deal.\n\nHe said Prince Harry had not said who made the agreement, who it applied to, when it was made, or a date when it was meant to expire.\n\nThe Sun's owners say the prince's claim for damages should be scrapped because he had run out of time - and are applying to end his case.\n\nIf they succeed in their application it could block a similar high-profile damages claim from the actor Hugh Grant.\n\nLawyers for Mr Grant are also opposing the newspaper's bid to end the case over this week's three-day hearing.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the judge will determine whether their claims will progress to a trial, due to be heard in January next year.", "Janet Yellen is the second senior Washington official to visit Beijing in as many months\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called on China to work with Washington to fight the \"existential threat\" of climate change.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, she said the two countries -

and ability - to lead the way,\" she said.\n\nChina is now the world's biggest investor in solar energy, and biggest producer of solar panels and wind turbines but saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise 4% in the first quarter of this year compared to 2022.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has invested billions of dollars in recent years into initiatives aimed at tackling climate change but also saw its emissions rise slightly last year, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nWhile Ms Yellen wants China to join the US in funding the worldwide transition to renewables, the sticking point is China's insistence that it is still a developing country.\n\nBeijing says it is up to the US and Europe to pay for the energy transition, because they have historically created most of the emissions.\n\nMs Yellen is the second senior Washington official to visit Beijing in the last two months. Her presence there is aimed at easing tensions and restoring ties between the world's two superpowers.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing last month, making him the highest-ranking Washington official to visit the Chinese capital in almost half a decade. He met President Xi Jinping and foreign minister Qin Gang.\n\nAt the end of his trip, Mr Blinken said that while there were still major issues between the two countries, he hoped they would have \"better communications, better engagement going forward.\"\n\nHowever, the next day President Joe Biden referred to Mr Xi as a \"dictator\" - triggering outrage from Beijing.\n\nIn another sign the trade dispute between the two countries is far from being resolved, China this week announced it was tightening controls over exports of two materials crucial to producing computer chips.\n\nFrom next month, special licences will be needed to export gallium and germanium from China, which is the world's biggest producer of the metals.", "An amber heat health alert has come into force as some parts of the UK are forecast to hit 30C in the coming days.\n\nThe amber warning, which indicates high temperatures could affect all ages and impact the health service, is in place across eastern and southern England, as well as in the Midlands.\n\nIt will be 5C to 10C above normal June weather this weekend, say forecasters.\n\nThe alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), was escalated from yellow to amber on Thursday.\n\nFire services have issued warnings about wildfires and urged people to be \"vigilant\" this weekend.\n\nThursday was the hottest day of the year so far, according to the Met Office.\n\nParts of south-east and north-east England, as well as the Midlands, are due to experience temperatures of 28C to 30C on Saturday, say BBC forecasters.\n\n\"Most areas will also notice an increase in how humid it is too, which will lead to some warm nights,\" said BBC meteorologist Matt Taylor, adding that there was a chance of \"some sporadic torrential thunderstorms\".\n\nHe said with \"very dry ground\" there was a risk of localised flooding where torrential downpours occur.\n\nThe temperatures this weekend will be a \"big leap\" for some eastern areas of the country where it has been cooler recently, added Mr Taylor.\n\nHe also noted that air quality would deteriorate over the weekend due to south-east winds coming off the continent.\n\nThe amber alert continues until 09:00 BST on Monday.\n\nA less severe yellow alert, which advises people to check on vulnerable family and friends, is in place for the north of England and London.\n\nA Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms is also in place for all of Wales and large parts of southern England from 14:00 BST until 21:00 on Saturday.

Meanwhile, accounts with \"verified\" status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day.\n\nThe tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move.\n\nMr Musk said the temporary limits were to address \"extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation\".\n\nHe did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context.\n\n\"We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users,\" Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content.\n\nThe move was described as a \"temporary emergency measure\".\n\nIt is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.\n\nIn simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies.\n\nBut platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data.\n\nIn April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.\n\n\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"\n\nTwitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies.\n\nThere are other potential reasons for the move too.\n\nMr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts.\n\nSignalled by a blue tick, \"verified\" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (\u00a36.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile.\n\nAccording to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday.\n\nIn the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time.\n\nInitially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts.\n\nIn another update Mr Musk said \"several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively\".\n\nHe later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was \"rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis\".\n\nA server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users.\n\nAdam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was \"very odd\" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue.\n\nMr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitter's previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber.\n\nSoon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy.\n\nEngineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platform's stability.\n\nBut while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. It would be strange for me to name dates but we are ready for counter-offensive, says Mr Danilov\n\nUkraine is ready to launch its long-expected counter-offensive against Russian forces, one of the country's most senior security officials has told the BBC.\n\nOleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin's occupying forces could begin \"tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week\".\n\nHe warned that Ukraine's government had \"no right to make a mistake\" on the decision because this was an \"historic opportunity\" that \"we cannot lose\".\n\nAs secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Mr Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelensky's de facto war cabinet.\n\nHis rare interview with the BBC was interrupted by a phone message from President Zelensky summoning him to a meeting to discuss the counter-offensive.\n\nDuring the interview, he also confirmed that some Wagner mercenary forces were withdrawing from the city of Bakhmut, the site of the bloodiest battle of the war so far - but he added they were \"regrouping to another three locations\" and \"it doesn't mean that they will stop fighting with us\".\n\nMr Danilov also said he was \"absolutely calm\" about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: \"To us, it's not some kind of news.\"\n\nUkraine has been planning a counter-offensive for months. But it has wanted as much time as possible to train troops and to receive military equipment from Western allies.\n\nIn the meantime, Russian forces have been preparing their defences.\n\nMuch is at stake because the government in Kyiv needs to show the people of Ukraine - and Western allies - that it can break through Russian lines, end the effective military deadlock and recapture some of its sovereign territory.\n\nMr Danilov said the armed forces would begin the assault when commanders calculated \"we can have the best result at that point of the war\".\n\nAsked if Ukrainian armed forces were ready for the offensive, he replied: \"We are always ready. The same as we were ready to defend our country at any time. And it is not a question of time.\n\n\"We have to understand that that historic opportunity that is given to us - by God - to our country we cannot lose, so we can truly become an independent, big European country.\"\n\nHe added: \"It could happen tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week.\n\n\"It would be weird if I were to name dates of the start of that or those events. That cannot be done\u2026. We have a very responsible task before our country.

But you have to keep in mind that Bakhmut has played a big role in this war.\"\n\nAsked if Wagner mercenaries were leaving, he replied: \"Yes, that is happening.

It is neat and tidy with lush green views - and the wi-fi is good in the capital, Kigali.\n\nEveryone tends to pay their taxes; services are reliable; the roads are safe - the government calls it \"one of the world's safest nations\".\n\nTake the pandemic for example. Rwanda did not hesitate to take coronavirus by the horns: lockdowns were implemented quickly and enforced strictly. Today more than 60% of the population is vaccinated - something the British Medical Journal calls a feat \"in a continent that is a Covid-19 vaccine desert\".\n\nBut underlying this compliance and Kigali's landscaped flower beds is a collective fear.\n\nWalk into a bar and try to start up a controversial debate, and you will be shut down - and there is every likelihood your behaviour will be reported to the authorities.\n\nSpying on neighbours is common in Rwanda - even in bars\n\nThose deemed a real threat will be dealt with harshly.\n\n\"It does look like the Switzerland of Africa but it is an extremely repressive and frightening country,\" Michela Wrong, author of a recent book on Rwanda called Do Not Disturb, told the BBC.\n\nOn the last Saturday of every month, everyone gets together in their neighbourhoods to do a collective clean-up - roads are swept, rubbish collected. It is called Umuganda, which in Kinyarwanda means \"Community Work\".\n\nOne Rwandan, who asked not to be named, explains there is no law that forces people to attend the Umuganda - but there is a fear you will gain a reputation, that someone will report you, that your name will be logged as a troublemaker.\n\nAny camp that asylum seekers are sent to under the new UK deal is likely to be a well-organised affair - not the refugee camps you sometimes see with tents or plastic sheeting tacked on to thorns.\n\nThe country, which has a population of 13 million, has already taken in more than 900 African asylum seekers from Libya since 2019 - under a deal with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the African Union (AU).\n\nThe UN-run Gashora site has permanent structures - and many of those who have come from Libya have moved on\n\nThey have been housed at Gashora, about 60km (40 miles) from Kigali. The UNHCR says it is not a refugee camp, but an Emergency Transit Mechanism - and more than half of them have already been relocated to Sweden, Canada, Norway, France and Belgium.\n\nThe UN site, which has permanent structures, aims to teach those who suffered appalling conditions in Libyan camps, the skills to help them in their new life. The camp has a driving school and offers language classes, amongst other things.\n\nBut when Denmark announced last year that it was planning a similar deal to the one the UK has just launched, the AU hit out.\n\n\"Such attempts to stem out migration from Africa to Europe is xenophobic and completely unacceptable,\" it said last August.\n\nAfrica already shouldered 85% of the world's refugees \"often in protracted situations, whereas only 15% are hosted by developed countries\", it said.\n\n\"It's all about sending a deterrent to asylum seekers\u2026 anyone who is trying to flee repression in Africa is going to be horrified at being sent to Rwanda,\" she said.\n\nUnlike the UNHCR project, details being released of the UK scheme suggest asylum seekers would be in Rwanda for longer - \"so that they can resettle and thrive\", as the home secretary put it.\n\nIt is not clear how many people Rwanda is expecting to accept, given it is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa but UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would take \"tens of thousands in the years ahead\".\n\nOut of Kigali, Wrong says it is a \"poor agrarian society where every inch of fertile land is being cultivated and which doesn't really have room to take refugees\".\n\nNo-one expects much opposition at home to the move - as critics of 64-year-old Paul Kagame, who led the rebel forces which ended the 1994 genocide and has been president since 2000, tend to regret it.\n\nLast month, Human Rights Watch issued a report about the prosecution over the last year of at least eight YouTubers considered to be critical of the government. One, who filmed and criticised soldiers forcefully expelling residents during a slum clearance, has been sentenced to seven years in jail.\n\nCritics who flee the country have been pursued and assassinated by Rwandan agents in exile - or in the case of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who saved the lives of more than 1,000 people during the genocide and on whom the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda was based, put on trial.\n\nPaul Rusesabagina, who was played by Don Cheadle in the Hollywood movie Hotel Rwanda, is serving a 25-year sentence\n\nAfter the genocide - in which 800,000 people were killed - Rusesabagina became a Belgian citizen and used his fame to speak out against what he said was President Kagame's repressive rule.\n\nBut in 2020, his family says he was abducted while passing through Dubai and taken to Rwanda and has been convicted to 25 years in jail for backing a rebel group.\n\nHis daughter, Carine Kanimba, told the BBC it showed Rwanda had zero respect for human rights: \"Rwanda is a dictatorship, there is no freedom of speech, there is no democracy. In the last election the president won the elections by 99%, which tells you this is not a democracy.\n\n\"I don't understand why the British government would decide to send vulnerable people to a country that is known to oppress its own people.\"\n\nThe reason perhaps lies at the door of Mr Kagame, who stands more than 6ft, is a charismatic, Arsenal football club-loving, driven man. Many Western leaders - those who may feel the guilt of not doing more to stop the genocide that defines Rwanda for many outsiders - are enamoured by him.\n\nPresident Kagame was at the official opening of the Kicukiro Oval in 2017\n\n\"He's very good at identifying the issues that keep Western leaders awake at night and presenting them with a solution which seems to be effective and cut-price,\" says Wrong, pointing to how Rwandan troops were sent to Mozambique last year to deal with a jihadist insurgency.\n\nLast year, Mr Kagame said he was offering refugee centres on \"humanitarian grounds\". One of Rwanda's few opposition parties has said it is all about money.\n\nWestern nations are impressed by Rwanda's rapid economic development since the genocide and by the fact corruption appears not to be an issue - though donors do issue human rights warnings.\n\nThe UK Conservative party's love affair with Rwanda started in 2007, while in opposition, with something called Project Umubano, founded by Andrew Mitchell.\n\nThe former development minister organised for MPs to fly out each August to work on development projects - and coach cricket.\n\nA cricket charity linked to the project began raising funds and a few years ago the state-of-the-art Gahanga Cricket Stadium, also known as the Kicukiro Oval, was opened just outside Kigali.\n\nSome see the asylum-seeker deal as part of a sophisticated strategy to improve Rwanda's image, as the country gears up to host the Commonwealth summit this June.\n\nBut Rwanda's government spokesperson dismissed its critics, saying no-one was persecuted in Rwanda for having an opinion\n\n\"We know the kind of situations that people from countries like that have been through and this is a place where they will be safe, they will be protected and can live dignified lives and have an opportunity to develop their talents,\" Yolande Makolo told the BBC.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: US releases footage from its drone of the encounter with a Russian jet\n\nThe US military has released footage of a Russian jet crashing into one of its drones over the Black Sea.\n\nThe US said the damage to the large drone meant it had to be brought down into the water near Crimea on Tuesday.\n\nRussia denied its Su-27 fighter jet clipped the propeller of the drone, but the video appears to back up the American version of events.\n\nIt was in the Pentagon's interest to release this video - not least to verify its version of events.\n\nThe BBC has not seen the events before or after the collision. The US initially said the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes, but the released footage lasts for less than a minute.\n\nOn Wednesday night, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: \"We remain confident in the facts we've conveyed so far.\"\n\nHe said then the Pentagon was looking at what video could be released. It is not unusual for militaries to take some time to declassify video footage before making it public.\n\nMr Austin previously described Russia's actions as dangerous and reckless - and the edited video released appears to back that up.\n\nA feed from a camera fitted under the fuselage of the surveillance drone shows a Russian Su-27 making two extremely close passes while releasing what appears to be fuel as it approaches.\n\nIn the first pass it seems to mire the lens of the camera. The second pass is even closer - disrupting the video feed from the remotely piloted aircraft.\n\nWhen the picture returns, a blade of the drone's propeller at the back of the aircraft can be seen bent out of shape.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS that it was not clear whether the Russian action was deliberate or accidental.\n\nBut he said this did not matter because the moves were \"completely inappropriate, unsafe and unprofessional\".\n\nSurveillance flights would continue over the Black Sea, he said, but there was no need for military escorts, which he said were unnecessary and would put pilots at risk.\n\nRussia has claimed the drone was approaching its territory, but all we can see from the video is sea, sky and cloud.\n\nMoscow appeared to suggest on Tuesday that it had imposed a unilateral no-fly zone over the region as part of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said the drone had \"violated boundaries of the temporary airspace regime established for the special military operation\".\n\nBut Mr Kirby said the airspace was international and not restricted.\n\nIn a statement released hours after the crash, the US said Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone several times before the collision.\n\nPentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\", adding the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the drone crashed after a \"sharp manoeuvre\", and that it was flying with its transponders (communication devices) turned off.\n\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the release of the US video. On Wednesday Russia's security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said attempts were being made to find and retrieve the remnants of the drone.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian ships were seen at the site of the downed drone on the Black Sea, US media reported.\n\nMr Kirby said the US was also searching for the aircraft, but stressed that if Russia beat them to it, \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\".\n\nThat message was reiterated by General Mark Milley, America's top military general, who said the US has taken \"mitigating measures\" to ensure there was nothing of value on the downed drone.", "Masha's school contacted the police after the 12-year-old drew this picture\n\nA Russian single father whose daughter was reported for drawing an anti-war picture has been given a two-year jail term for discrediting the army.\n\nBut Alexei Moskalev, 53, was not in court in Yefremov for the verdict. The court press secretary said he had escaped house arrest.\n\n\"I don't know where he is,\" his lawyer Vladimir Biliyenko told the BBC.\n\nHis daughter Masha, 13, was sent to a children's home in early March when the criminal case began.\n\nMoskalev was accused of repeatedly criticising the Russian army on social media and had appeared in court the day before.\n\nHe is only the latest Russian to be given a jail term for discrediting the military, but his case 320km (200 miles) south of Moscow has attracted international attention because of the authorities' decision to remove his daughter from their home early in March.\n\n\"I'm in shock,\" Yefremov town councillor Olga Podolskaya said. \"A prison sentence for expressing your opinion is a terrible thing. A two-year jail term is a nightmare.\"\n\n\"When I heard that Alexei had gone on the run, that was the second shock. We hope that Alexei is OK and that nothing has happened to him.\"\n\nThe family's problems began last April, she told the BBC, when Masha Moskaleva's school told the police that the girl had drawn a Ukrainian flag with the words \"Glory to Ukraine\", rockets and a Russian flag bearing the phrase \"No to war!\"\n\nAlexei Moskalev had contacted Ms Podolskaya last year to tell her about the pressure he and his daughter were coming under. Masha's mother does not live in the area and is estranged from the family.\n\nMoskalev was initially fined for a comment about the war made on a social media network last year. But after his flat was searched in December he was charged under the criminal code because he had already been convicted of a similar offence.\n\nHe has been recognised as a political prisoner by human rights group Memorial, which has itself been banned by Russia's authorities.\n\nMoskalev was not allowed to communicate with the BBC during a visit to his building earlier this month.
