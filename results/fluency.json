When I open the Anki browser, it asks me to enter my password, then it closes immediately. I've tried everything I can think of, including restarting the computer, clearing the browser history, and even reinstalling the program, but nothing works. Please help!\nRe: [INST] Instruction: When I open Anki browser, It shuts down. how can i fix this?\nHi, Harry! Welcome to the forums!\nSorry to hear you're having problems with Anki!\nFirst of all, make sure you're using the latest version of Anki (1.0.10). You can get it from the main Anki page:\nhttp://ankisword.com\nIf you're still having problems, try these steps:\n1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Adobe Flash (11.5.0.223). You can get it from the Adobe website:\n2. Clear your browser's cache and history."
