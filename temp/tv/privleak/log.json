In my view, there was no point at which Tewkesbury students faced any direct threat.\n\n\"I am pleased to say that I am recovering well. My thanks to everyone who helped put me on the road to what is expected to be a full recovery.\n\nPupils were locked down for several hours while armed police combed the area\n\n\"I have received more than one hundred messages of support, which has been a big boost.

But there are no similar return deals with any other countries, our correspondent said.\n\nAnd the Rwanda plan was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last month, although ministers are challenging the judgement.\n\nOn Tuesday, an accommodation barge arrived in Portland Port, Dorset, where it is due to eventually house 500 asylum seekers.\n\nThe first asylum seekers are expected to board the Bibby Stockholm later this month, despite protests from locals.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said that the government wants to \"open more\" accommodation facilities for asylum seekers.\n\nFor weeks, the government was locked in a battle over the final shape of the bill with the Lords, where a cross-party group of peers made repeated amendments.\n\nIn the last few days, the bill passed between the House of Commons and House of Lords three times, in a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May led a series of backbench rebellions in the Commons over plans to restrict access to the UK asylum system for victims of modern slavery.\n\nUnder the bill the duty to remove anyone who comes to the UK illegally applies to victims of trafficking and slavery, accompanied children and unaccompanied children as soon as they turn 18.\n\nMs May, who as home secretary introduced the Modern Slavery Act, said the bill \"will enable more slave drivers to operate and make money out of human misery\".\n\nThe government argued that anyone identified as a potential victim of modern slavery would be returned home or to another \"safe country away from those who have trafficked them\".\n\nHowever, on Monday Mrs May did not vote for an exemption from the bill for suspected victims of slavery to allow them to access support and co-operate with criminal proceedings against traffickers.\n\nThe legislation would also scrap existing legal caps on how long those entering the UK illegally can be held ahead of being deported.\n\nMPs and peers had attempted to reinsert the three day-limit on how long children can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult.

She and O'Ceallaigh were a couple, but their relationship was on the rocks. Prince's lovelorn lyrics matched her own state of mind. If he was gone, she could do whatever she wanted, she could see whomever she chose - but nothing would compare to him.\n\n\"They were in the process of breaking up when we recorded Nothing Compares 2 U,\" said Chris Birkett, who co-produced and engineered the song, in an interview with Sound On Sound.\n\n\"That's probably why she did such a good vocal. She came into the studio, did it in one take, double-tracked it straight away and it was perfect because she was totally into the song. It mirrored her situation.\"\n\nAt this point, it's a good idea to go and listen to The Family's original recording or Prince's demo, which was released in 2018. The song is there, but it's all dressed up in Paisley finery. Every line ends with a baroque piano figure, the bridge is drowning in syrupy strings, there's even a saxophone solo.\n\nWhatever emotion Prince was channelling, he did his best to hide it. O'Connor did the opposite.\n\nWorking with Japanese jazz virtuoso Gota Yashiki and Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper, she put a line through all the ornate R&B flourishes and pared the song back its bare essentials.\n\nThe arrangement is simple - a drum loop, some gauzy strings and a haunting choir of backing vocals. They're pushed and pulled by the tidal wave of her voice, like sand on a beach, as she wrestles with various stages of devastation.\n\nShe starts quietly, almost cowering as she sings: \"It's been seven hours and 15 days since you took your love away.\" Then she's defiant: \"Since you been gone, I can do whatever I want\" but her bravado collapses into anguish once she realises that \"nothing will take away these blues\".\n\nBy the chorus, she's face to face with grief. Her voice strives for power, but it cracks again. Then, In a change to Prince's melody, she shifts the pitch of the final \"to you\" to a despondent monotone, the dissonance illustrating her pain.\n\nIt's one of the all-time great vocal performances.\n\nO'Connor's other hits include Mandinka, I Am Stretched On Your Grave and Thank You For Hearing Me\n\nIn O'Connor's hands, Nothing Compares 2 U was always going to be a hit, but the video made it a phenomenon.\n\nDirector John Maybury shot several hours of footage of the singer walking through a washed-out Paris. You can see glimpses of it in the finished promo - O'Connor dressed in black, reflected in the Seine, walking through the stunning Parc de Saint-Cloud.\n\nBut once she'd performed the song to the camera, Maybury knew her close-up had to be the focus.\n\nFrom the beginning, O'Connor stares straight at us, her pale green eyes peering out of the screen, searching for connection. But as she sings, she breaks eye contact, glancing down, as though she's unable to keep her emotions in check.\n\nAt the end, famously, two tears roll down her cheeks.\n\nThose tears were genuine, and they represented a loss Prince could never have imagined when he wrote Nothing Compares 2 U in the middle of his Purple Rain hot streak.\n\nO'Connor's mother had died in a car crash in 1986, when the singer was still a teenager. They had not had an easy relationship. O'Connor later accused her of being mentally and physically abusive. But when she sang Prince's final verse, all that grief came flooding back.\n\n\"All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard / All died when you went away/ I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard / But I'm willing to give it another try.\"\n\nThat's the moment that prompted those tears.\n\n\"I didn't know I was going to cry when I sang in the video because I didn't cry in the studio recording it,\" she later recalled.\n\n\"[But] every time I sing that song I think of my mother. I never stop crying for my mother. I couldn't face being in Ireland for 13 years because of it.\"\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

In her 2021 memoir, she said he told her off for swearing in interviews, then challenged her to a pillow fight, only to bash her with something hard he'd slipped into his pillowcase.\n\nDespite that, she still held Nothing Compares 2U in great reverence,\n\n\"It's really about emotions, it's not about notes,\" she told BBC 6 Music in 2016.\n\n\"I think I'm probably similar to millions of people who loved the song, and we're all people who associated the song with a loss of some kind.\"\n\nThe High Court ruled that some lawsuits had been submitted too late to proceed\n\nHugh Grant is set to take the Sun newspaper on in court over claims it used illegal methods to gather stories about him.\n\nThe actor believes private investigators working for the Sun tapped his phone, bugged his house and car, and burgled his home.\n\nThe Sun's publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) unsuccessfully argued his action should be blocked because he waited too long to launch it.\n\nNGN denies the claims against it.\n\nA judge was asked to rule on whether Mr Grant's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed because it dates back further than six years, the cut-off point for legal action of this kind in civil courts.\n\nThis time limitation has become a major legal battleground in cases against newspapers, because allegations of wrongdoing often go back 30 years.\n\nPublishers attempt to argue that cases should not go to trial because alleged victims of unlawful newsgathering delayed their legal action.\n\nBut Mr Grant argued he should be allowed to bring the case now because material he and his lawyers will rely on only came to light in recent years.\n\nSome of the evidence against the newspaper was contained in a 2021 witness statement made by private investigator Gavin Burrows.\n\nIt was only when NGN disclosed invoices for their payments to Mr Burrows around the same time that Mr Grant had access to potential evidence which could help him win his case in court.\n\nIn his judgement, Mr Justice Fancourt acknowledged that the 62-year-old actor and privacy campaigner had long believed that private investigators had been paid to look into his affairs.\n\nThe judge said there was a realistic chance Mr Grant would establish at trial that, before seeing the 2021 evidence, \"he could not reasonably have believed with sufficient confidence that he may have been targeted by [private investigators] instructed by the Sun\".\n\nThis judgment does not mean the issue of whether Mr Grant's claim is too late has been decided, but it will now be considered at the trial next year.\n\nIn a statement released through his lawyer, Mr Grant said: \"I am pleased that my case will be allowed to go to trial, which is what I have always wanted - because it is necessary that the truth comes out about the activities of the Sun.\n\n\"As my case makes clear, the allegations go far wider and deeper than voicemail interception.\"\n\nMr Grant's statement in the case claims that for years newspaper published News UK lied about its involvement in phone hacking and illegal information gather", "PPL": 0.7806695699691772, "PPL/lower": 0.7762827060603155, "PPL/zlib": 0.00020895866433864486, "Min-5%": 6.876757196351593, "Min-10%": 5.323995666176665, "Min-20%": 3.558780636793244, "Min-30%": 2.5546810376770335, "Min-40%": 1.9460558505423713, "Min-50%": 1.5607372030309918, "Min-60%": 1.3010415077375943}, {"text": "ing.\n\nNurses protest during a strike by NHS medical workers outside University College London Hospital in London\n\nMeanwhile, in England a 5% pay rise from April has been offered to NHS staff including nurses and ambulance workers.\n\nIn addition, staff have been offered a one-off payment of at least \u00a31,655 to top up the past year's pay award.\n\nUnions are recommending members back the deal, after nearly two weeks of talks with ministers, raising hopes the bitter dispute may be coming to an end.\n\nThe offer covers all NHS staff except doctors, who are on a different contract.\n\nIt comes after a winter of industrial action, with nurses, ambulance staff and physios all striking.\n\nThe unions put further action on hold, after the two sides agreed to discussions last month.\n\nJason, six-months old, is currently up for adoption at All Dogs Matter\n\nIllegal imports of puppies have continued to thrive following the pandemic, a study into UK purchasing practices suggests.\n\nThe Royal Veterinary College says the rise means dogs are at risk of being exposed to infectious diseases and a \"very impoverished environment\".\n\nThe report highlights other irresponsible practices from breeders such as only offering online viewings.\n\nThe government said buyers must go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre.\n\nThe rise in puppy smuggling came amid a surge in demand for puppies during the coronavirus lockdowns, with prices in some areas more than doubling to an average of almost \u00a31,900 each.\n\nIn a study published on Thursday in the journal Animals and shared with the BBC, the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) highlighted trends in puppy purchasing across the UK.\n\nDr Rowena Packer, first author of the study, said the rise in imported puppies was concerning.\n\nThe study estimates 10% of puppies purchased in 2021 were imported, more than double the figure from 2019.\n\nBabaloo's owner, Ms Papantoni, describes her as \"a very lovely, happy, energetic, kind, sensitive, and a bit of a naughty dog\"\n\nIn December 2020, Vasiliki Papantoni, in London, legally imported a puppy from Serbia after carefully planning the dog's journey to the UK.\n\nShe said the breeder had a \"good reference\" from a friend and provided lots of paperwork.\n\nMs Papantoni said she started her search for a puppy in the UK, but found that waiting lists were \"very long\".\n\nShe said a previous attempt to purchase a puppy in the UK ended in her being \"scammed\" when a breeder stopped contact after receiving a \u00a3300 deposit.\n\nDr Packer warns not all imported puppies receive good care when taken across Europe. \"These could be puppies that were transported for several days without appropriate provisions, rest, food, water,\" she said.\n\nThe RVC say puppies brought into the UK are \"often under the minimum legal age\" of 15 weeks, unlike Babaloo.\n\nThe organisation asked UK puppy purchasers the same questions over three years via an online survey. They analysed 1,148 responses from 2019, 4,369 from 2020 and 2,080 from 2021.\n\nDr Packer warns \"poor welfare sources\" also exist within the UK, such as \"a breeder or a dealer or somebody who produces puppies without due regard to their health and welfare\".\n\n\"You can very rapidly and cheaply rear a puppy if you don't care about some of those factors,\" she said.\n\nIntroduced in April 2020, 'Lucy's Law' requires puppies bred in England be shown with their mother and purchased from the place they were born.\n\nThe law does not apply to rescue and rehoming organisations, Defra said.\n\nDr Marc Abraham OBE, a vet, founded the campaign. He calls it a \"first step in combating irresponsible breeding and selling practices\".\n\nBut he adds it was overshadowed by the pandemic.\n\nIra Moss, founder of charity All Dogs Matter, says she knows of multiple puppy purchasers who were only shown pictures of the dog's parents, or were not allowed into the property where they were said to have been born.\n\nThe RVC's study estimates people purchasing puppies in 2021 \"were more likely to rely on online viewings, rather than in person, and to collect the puppy from outside the breeder's property\".\n\nIn 2019, only 7% of respondents viewed the puppy they purchased via a live video call. In 2021, the figure was 18%.\n\nThe pandemic restrictions still in effect for parts of 2021 may have factored into that year's figure.\n\nDr Abraham says the pandemic also led to a \"huge surge in demand\" for dogs, pushing up the price for a puppy and leading to more first time owners.\n\nHe adds: \"There's so many inexperienced dog owners around that I'm not not sure people did enough investment in how to look after a dog.\"\n\nIn turn, he warns this has led to a \"spike in dogs being abandoned\".\n\nIn October 2022, RSPCA data showed the charity had seen a 25% rise in abandonment cases.\n\nAll Dogs Matter says the rescue sector now faces a \"rehoming crisis\". Ms Moss explains \"there are too many dogs, not enough spaces\".\n\nFurthermore, the cost of living crisis means \"charities are losing money with less donations coming in\".\n\nDr Abraham says \"rescue shelters have rules for a reason\".\n\n\"Please don't think\u2026if they say no, that you should then go online and have a puppy delivered,\" he added.\n\nA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \"Buyers must do their research and ensure they go to a reputable seller or rehoming centre when looking for a pet.\n\n\"We are committed to delivering the Kept Animals Bill measures individually, including on puppy smuggling, during the remainder of this Parliament and look forward to progressing these.

But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Sunday's talks led to \"the extension of the deal until the end of 2024\".\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that his country's cut of one million bpd could be extended beyond July if needed. \"This is a Saudi lollipop,\" he said, in what is seen as a bid to stabilise the market.\n\nBefore the two-day Opec+ meeting started, it was widely expected the oil cartel would make production cuts to prop up prices. It appears most members were against the idea, as any cuts would impact oil revenues, which are crucial to keep running their economies.\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision to make a voluntary reduction of one-million barrels per day was unexpected but does not come as a huge surprise.

The two one-off payments for 22/23 we don't believe will create future inflationary pressures.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added the rise for the coming year would also not stoke inflation, since \"5% is broadly in line with pay growth in the wider economy so we don't see it having an impact on private sector pay which ultimately leads to inflation\".\n\nAnd when asked whether the money to fund the rise would have to come from the existing NHS/Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) budget the spokesperson insisted frontline service would not suffer and discussions were taking place between the DHSC and the Treasury.\n\nWhen asked about further money for the NHS to fund the deal, the spokesperson again said discussions would take place with the Treasury.\n\nHowever, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting criticised the \"last minute\" nature of the offer, calling the government \"incompetent\" and saying Mr Barclay \"doesn't know how he's going to pay for it\".\n\n\"Even when they arrive at a solution it's so late that it causes a new wave of problems.\"\n\nNHS staff have seen pay rise by an average of 4.75% during 2022-23 - with the lowest paid receiving the biggest rises - but unions had been asking for above-inflation rises, which at one point, would have equated to an increase of more than 14%.\n\nThe one-off payment to top up that pay award starts at \u00a31,655 for the lowest-paid staff such as cleaners and porters and rises to just over \u00a32,400 for the most senior front-line roles such as nurse consultants.\n\nFor staff in management positions, such as directors of nursing and chief finance officers, the one-off payment is worth up to \u00a33,789.\n\nThe government had originally offered 3.5% from April, for the 2023-24 financial year - but during the talks, ministers agreed to 5%.

It is an issue that is emotionally charged like few others. And particularly now as war in Europe again looms large.\n\nBoth sides accuse each other of irrational ideology.\n\nConservative commentators and politicians say the country is in thrall to Green Party dogma, that scraps domestic nuclear power at a time when cutting Russian energy means rising prices. They accuse the government of increasing reliance on fossil fuels instead of using nuclear, which has lower emissions.\n\n\"It's a black day for climate protection in Germany,\" said Jens Spahn, conservative CDU MP, on RTL television earlier this week.\n\nThere have been attempts to rid Germany of nuclear power for decades\n\nGreens and left-wingers argue that it is illogical to cling to nuclear power, which is more expensive than wind or solar. The government argues that keeping the three ageing atomic power stations online would need huge investment \u2014 funds that should go into renewable energy sources.\n\nIt is odd for the CDU to suddenly champion climate protection, say Green Party MPs, given that the conservatives regularly block measures to expand renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nIronically, given the CDU's current fight for nuclear, it was a conservative-led government under Angela Merkel that decided to phase out atomic power after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Her decision was popular with voters, coming on the back of widespread anti-nuclear sentiment sparked by the catastrophe. Cynics suggest that upcoming key regional elections may have influenced her decision.\n\nToday, Germany gets almost half of its electricity from renewables - 44% in 2022, according to the Federal Statistical Office - and just 6% from atomic power. Green economy minister Robert Habeck predicts that 80% of Germany's electricity will be renewable by 2030 and has pushed through laws to make it quicker and easier to build solar and wind farms.\n\nBut over the last year, the proportion of renewables has stagnated while CO2 emissions have increased, as Germany has been forced to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and use more coal instead of Russian gas. This has sparked even some Green voters and anti-nuclear activists to support temporarily extending the lifespan of the last three nuclear power stations.\n\nIn an article published in Friday's edition of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Green Party environment minister Steffi Lemke wrote that Germany was shutting down nuclear because catastrophic accidents can never be ruled out, \"whether it be through human error like Chernobyl, natural disasters like Fukushima\u2026 or attacks, as Ukraine is suffering because of Russia's war\".\n\nGermany does not need nuclear, she argues, because renewables are safer, more sustainable, better for the climate and make more economic sense.\n\nDespite predictions of shortages and blackouts, Germany produces more energy than it needs, exporting energy to France over the summer, note Green Party leaders pointedly, where nuclear power stations could not operate because of extreme weather.\n\nVoters are divided. According to this week's ARD-DeutschlandTrend poll, 59% of Germans are against shutting down atomic energy, with only 34% in favour. Support for nuclear is strongest amongst older and conservative voters.\n\nBut more detailed questioning reveals a nuanced picture. In a YouGov poll from earlier this week, 65% supported keeping the three remaining nuclear power stations running for now. But only 33% wanted Germany to keep nuclear power indefinitely. In other words, pull the plug - but just not quite yet.\n\nMany supporters of nuclear power argue it is a cleaner fuel than some other options\n\nOn Thursday, the conservative leader of Bavaria Markus S\u00f6der visited Isar 2, and called for Germany to not only keep the last three reactors online, but also to reactivate old power stations - including one shut down in Bavaria by him.\n\nMeanwhile Christian Lindner, finance minister and head", "PPL": 0.687403678894043, "PPL/lower": 0.7338543042716664, "PPL/zlib": 0.00017854641010234883, "Min-5%": 6.1937465994965795, "Min-10%": 4.567537151130975, "Min-20%": 2.9770169332441316, "Min-30%": 2.1632328411558164, "Min-40%": 1.6810331340232514, "Min-50%": 1.3638600572535835, "Min-60%": 1.14298153657721}, {"text": "foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term\".\n\nBut it also describes China under Communist Party rule as an \"epoch-defining and systemic challenge... across almost every aspect of national life and government policy\".\n\nIt says the government will engage \"constructively\" with Beijing on shared priorities but where the Chinese government's actions threaten the UK's interests \"we will take swift and robust action to protect them\".\n\nFormer Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the Tory MPs calling for the government to take a tougher line on China, said he was \"confused\" about what the government's position was.\n\n\"Does that now mean that China is a threat or an epoch-defining challenge or a challenging government epoch or none of that?\" he asked in the Commons.\n\nMr Lammy said the updated review was \"overdue\" but welcome.\n\n\"The initiative to improve understanding of China in government is vital, particularly given the Foreign Office has only been training 14 people a year to speak fluent Mandarin,\" he added.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris spoke to the media after meeting the main Stormont parties\n\nThe secretary of state has hit back at accusations that he had set out a \"punishment budget\".\n\nHe was responding to claims from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that it was \"wrong for people to punish people of Northern Ireland\".\n\nThe secretary of state said Stormont can repay a \u00a3300m budget overspend across two years rather than one.\n\nRepaying the 2022-23 overspend over a longer period will \"provide some protection to frontline public services\", he said.\n\nBut he added departments still faced difficult decisions \"in order to live within the funding available\".\n\nStormont officials have been planning for budget cuts of at least \u00a3500m in cash terms in this financial year - most Stormont departments will have their budgets cut in cash terms.\n\n\"The purpose was not to punish anybody with this budget - it's to make sure services can continue in the absence of devolved government,\" said Mr Heaton-Harris.\n\nAsked what else he could offer the DUP given that its stance on re-entering Stormont has not changed, he replied: \"Let's see where talks lead to.\"\n\nDUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had \"real concerns about the lack of allocations within the budget for pay awards\".\n\n\"There are major challenges here and we are concerned about the way the Northern Ireland Office is handling things,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what the secretary of state described as a flat budget.\n\n\"Of course I want to see Stormont back up and running but it needs to be on a stable foundation.\"\n\nHe said going back to Stormont was not a \"quick fix\".\n\nThe Department of Health, the largest department, is receiving an allocation of \u00a37.25bn for day-to-day spending - similar to the amount it got last year.\n\nThis \"flat cash\" funding will likely be viewed as a difficult settlement for the department, given the current high rate of inflation and outstanding pay demands.\n\nCompared with last year's budget figures the amount of money going to Education, Justice and Economy - the biggest spending departments - has been cut slightly in cash terms.\n\nEducation will get \u00a32.57bn, down from \u00a32.64bn, Justice will get \u00a31.12bn, down from \u00a31.14bn, while Economy will get \u00a3772m, down from \u00a3780m.\n\nThis budget could have been worse. But make no mistake, it is still likely to mean deteriorating public services for NI citizens.\n\nThe blow has been softened a little by allowing last year's \u00a3300m overspend to be repaid over two years instead of one.\n\nThe repayments will be drawn from any new money sent from Westminster later this year rather than being immediately chopped from departmental funds.\n\nBut that will present a significant challenge to the senior civil servants currently running Stormont.\n\nThere is an expectation that the UK government will eventually provide extra money to settle public sector pay disputes in England.\n\nThat will automatically mean extra funding for Stormont.\n\nBut that raises the prospect that the senior officials will then have to tell their workforces that they will not get a pay deal to match England because the overspend comes first.\n\nThat is not a recipe for industrial peace.\n\nRead more from John here.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the overspend would be cleared by using any additional in-year funding from the Treasury.\n\nShould this not cover the full amount, the outstanding balance would be paid in 2024-25 by reallocating money from previously announced Northern Ireland funding packages.\n\nIt is understood that the possibility of drawing on a funding stream known as financial transactions capital (FTC) is being considered.\n\nThis is a conditional form of capital funding which Stormont consistently underspends.\n\nThe Treasury would have to agree that FTC could be used in this way.\n\nNo new money-raising policies, such as water charges, were advanced by the Northern Ireland secretary.\n\nHe repeated that lower levels of revenue generation but higher public-service provision in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK was \"unsustainable\".\n\nNew legislation to allow the UK government to explore options for increasing budget sustainability has also been introduced.\n\nIt will work with the Northern Ireland Civil Service to review areas for further revenue raising.\n\nIn Belfast on Wednesday people protested against budget cuts\n\nStormont can expect more money if the UK government allocates new funding to settle public sector pay deals in England.\n\nBut if that money must be used to reduce the overspend, it could be very difficult for senior officials to offer similar pay deals to public servants in Northern Ireland unless savings are found in other areas.\n\nUlster University economist Esmond Birney said the budget presented a tough challenge for the Stormont departments.\n\nHe described allowing the overspend to be paid down over two years as being the least worst option, compared to doing it immediately which \"would have implied very large spending cuts in this year\".\n\nOn Wednesday the head of Stormont's civil service, Jayne Brady, warned that the \"damage\" caused by the proposed budget reductions would be unprecedented.\n\nWriting to Mr Heaton-Harris's office, she outlined her \"profound concern\" about senior civil servants being placed in \"harmful decision-making positions\" about which services should be cut.\n\nIt was a rare and significant intervention, and one not typically made by senior civil servants.\n\nRetail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the budget would be \"brutal for public services\".\n\nHe said civil servants would be put in an \"incredibly difficult position when deciding on how to apply severe cuts\".\n\nHe called for a restored executive and a review of how Northern Ireland is financed.\n\nThe secretary of state hosted round table talks with parties in Northern Ireland\n\nThe Stormont political parties met Mr Heaton-Harris on Thursday afternoon about the budget.\n\nThey are not in government due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont, which began in February 2022.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's former Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the budget would devastate public services.\n\n\"The absence of an executive is really reprehensible at this stage when this is the outcome for people we represent,\" he said.\n\nUlster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the budget did not contain \"any flexibility\".\n\n\"It's quite grim, if I'm really honest, but it's been put to us and it's difficult to do anything without a government up and running,\" he said.\n\nAlliance Party assembly member Andrew Muir described the discussions as \"grim and truly bleak\".\n\nHe expressed concern that it would be left to civil servants to take decisions about cuts and said that was \"entirely wrong\".\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Matthew O'Toole described the meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris as concerning.\n\nHe said the budget would mean \"a real squeeze on public services\" imposed on people in Northern Ireland that they did not deserve, ask or vote for.\n\nPermanent secretaries - top civil servants - have been running Northern Ireland's nine departments since October but their powers are severely limited.\n\nThey can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians and their ability to react to changing circumstances is negligible.\n\nDepartments have been operating without proper budgets since the start of the financial year in April.\n\nThe pub closed on 1 May and Mrs R", "PPL": 0.4423719644546509, "PPL/lower": 0.6363167930423093, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001217649227785992, "Min-5%": 4.548119439798243, "Min-10%": 3.167514106806587, "Min-20%": 1.9872671907134627, "Min-30%": 1.4176950850053796, "Min-40%": 1.0911213476711787, "Min-50%": 0.8809844461266946, "Min-60%": 0.7364301300920085}, {"text": "ally Pendreigh took this picture of Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh from Braid Hills.\n\nJulie Izon-Williams took this photo on May Day on the cliffs at Burrowhead, Isle of Whithorn.

New guidelines on social media demanded an \"extra responsibility\" for presenters with a \"high profile\".

O'Donoghue told the media that his bandmate had taken a break to spend time with his family.\n\nHe explained to Sunday World that the group were supportive of Sheehan's decision and described them as a \"a band of brothers\" who \"stick together no matter what\".\n\nIn 2013, The Script had a brush with royalty, when the Queen visited the BBC's Broadcasting House and watched a performance by The Script, briefly chatting with singer O'Donoghue.\n\nSheehan said when he was told about the royal engagement, he thought \"people were playing a joke on us\".\n\nThe Script are scheduled to support the American artist P!nk during her European tour later this year.\n\nThree people have been arrested by detectives investigating the murder of a woman outside a Merseyside pub on Christmas Eve.\n\nElle Edwards, 26, was shot in the head while celebrating with friends at The Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village.\n\nA man and a woman, both 23, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, Merseyside Police said.\n\nThomas Waring, 20, was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and assisting an offender.\n\nMr Waring, of Private Drive, Barnston, Wirral, is due to appear at Wirral Adult Remand Court on Thursday.\n\nThe man, from Heswall, and woman, from Tranmere, have been released on bail.\n\nConnor Chapman, 22, has already been charged with murdering Ms Edwards and is due to go on trial on 7 June.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

They are being forced to take strike action due to need not greed.\"\n\nHeathrow says it has offered a 10% pay rise.\n\nStrike action in other countries, notably France, has already caused a number of airlines to cancel flights this year.\n\nMonday's strike in Germany has also caused cancellations.\n\nHow will the Heathrow strike affect your plans?

They did not want to draw attention to their school - or pupils who identify as trans or non-binary.\n\nIn 2018, the government said it would work with the human-rights watchdog to publish \"comprehensive guidance for schools on how to support trans pupils\". Without it, many schools are making their own decisions, such as whether to introduce gender-neutral toilets or changing rooms - and how they are used.\n\nSome teachers told BBC News they worried whatever they did would \"not only be criticised but publicly vilified\" and, while schools needed clarity, it was a \"no-win\" situation.\n\nOthers said they might have to consult solicitors, amid fears of doing the \"wrong thing\".\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton told BBC News many schools wanted better guidance and advice to help make decisions \"in the best interests of the child\".\n\nHis, Chesterfield High School, a mixed-sex comprehensive in Crosby, Merseyside, has developed its own approach.\n\nThe school has more than 1,200 pupils, 10-20 of whom identify as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid.\n\nThere are single-sex and gender-neutral toilets, with floor-to-ceiling lockable cubicles and a supervising member of staff. And private PE changing rooms, used by all the trans pupils, are available to all.\n\nThe school's support for children questioning their gender identity had been developed over the past decade, Mr Sexton said.\n\n\"We've tried to create a school that's tolerant and inclusive,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll work with individual children to actually think about what they want to use and access - and it becomes really manageable.\"\n\nChesterfield High had never faced a challenge from parents - but other head teachers had.\n\nHead teacher Kevin Sexton says everyone should feel safe and happy at school\n\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked almost 7,000 teachers in England a series of questions about their experience with transgender pupils.\n\nAbout 8% of primary-school teachers said they taught trans or non-binary pupils, compared with 75% in secondary.\n\nAnd just over half said they would not be very or at all confident about the next steps to take if a child wanted to change their name, use different pronouns or change their appearance, hairstyle or clothes - what is known as socially transitioning.\n\nWhen and how schools should involve parents if a child wishes to identify as a gender different to their birth sex - and what to do if a parent disagrees - are among the most controversial matters the guidance is expected to address.\n\nEvery classroom at Chesterfield High School has a pride flag\n\nA report into gender-identity services in England says socially transitioning may have significant psychological effects - and better information is needed about its outcomes.\n\nAnd last year, an NHS England consultation proposed socially transitioning should be considered in certain circumstances only, such as to alleviate or prevent \"clinically significant distress\".\n\nAbout three-quarters of the teachers in the Teacher Tapp survey said their school would support a child who wished to socially transition.\n\nAnd 39% of the secondary teachers who responded said they would support this, regardless of parental consent.\n\n\"Everyone involved in a child's life should work together and investigate why a child may feel a certain way,\" says Tanya Carter, of the Safe Schools Alliance organisation, which is worried about how some schools are managing gender identity.\n\n\"Teachers are not doctors. [Socially transitioning] is something that should only be done with medical oversight. Concerns arise when schools affirm someone as the opposite sex, locking in what may or not may not be a transient phase in that child's life.\"\n\nThe organisation receives several messages every day from both parents and teachers worried about toilets, changing rooms, sports and overnight accommodation on school trips becoming mixed-sex.\n\n\"We get parents who have found out that their children have been socially transitioned behind their backs at schools, because the schools haven't spoken to parents,\" Miss Carter says. \"Schools are keeping secrets from parents.\"\n\nPenni Allen, who runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, says the school takes parents' views into account but that \"doesn't mean that we're not going to continue supporting that child\".\n\nThe school tries to de-escalate any emotions and issues with parents and help the child understand what they are feeling.\n\n\"Some children will come and say they're just exploring,\" Mrs Allen says. \"Others will say they've been feeling this way for quite some time. They might just be at the start of a journey that never goes anywhere.\n\n\"It's not about putting them on a pathway. We don't put your child in a box and put a label on it that says, 'Your child is now trans.'\n\n\"We like to think we've got a good relationship with parents here\u2026 and hopefully, we get it right.\"\n\nPenni Allen runs Chesterfield High's wellbeing unit, where pupils can talk to counsellors about difficulties, including around gender identity\n\nBBC News spoke to parents of trans children at other schools in England but, as with teachers, it is difficult to find a view everyone agrees with and will speak about on record.\n\nSome parents told BBC News they did not want any decisions made without their approval and were not happy with their children changing their names or pronouns.\n\nSome felt their children may be struggling with their sexual orientation, rather than gender identity, and needed space and time to explore that before making other decisions, which could potentially lead down a medical pathway such as puberty blockers.\n\nBut others wanted schools to put their child's choices first, regardless of their own involvement, and were supportive of their trans identity and socially transitioning.\n\nThe decisions schools make, or do not make, can have a huge impact on the young people affected.\n\nEllie, 18, was the first pupil to publicly identify as", "PPL": 1.104905605316162, "PPL/lower": 0.8757760559491623, "PPL/zlib": 0.00029645978141029303, "Min-5%": 6.475404903000476, "Min-10%": 5.274406823457456, "Min-20%": 3.9494013086799304, "Min-30%": 3.1346798137267173, "Min-40%": 2.5673230912659193, "Min-50%": 2.1456744067836553, "Min-60%": 1.824275437038671}, {"text": ", who chairs the Broadcasting Press Guild, said: \"As an organisation of journalists, the BPG is always among the first to see the value of great interviewing - and these BBC radio interviews were game-changing for Liz Truss and her doomed government.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the PM's feet were held to the fire in these eight radio sessions in a way that stood out among so much drama that was happening in British politics last summer.\"\n\nThe BBC's controller local audio commissioning, Chris Burns, said: \"It really was an iconic moment in local radio and also for how we work digitally, as the interviews were then packaged up into the most popular Newscast episode of all time for BBC Sounds.\n\n\"Our presenters - as they always do - were speaking for the communities they serve, as well as the whole country when they asked those questions.

But as a deal with ministers was reached in England this week, the BBC can now reveal details of the secret and unprecedented talks.\n\nOn cold, frosty mornings on nurses' picket lines the rhetoric was fiery and noisy. Striking nurses condemned the government for failing to open pay talks. Ministers criticised walkouts affecting patients.\n\nBut behind the scenes it was a very different story. Secret contacts were being made between the two sides.\n\nFrom early January there were confidential approaches from an unofficial source to the Royal College of Nurses (RCN), the nurses' union, about the possibility of talks beginning in England. This involved putting out feelers to see what might bring the nurses' union to the table.\n\nStrikes by nurses and other health unions - representing paramedics, midwives and other NHS staff - had been triggered when ministers insisted on sticking to the recommendations of the independent pay review body (PRB). It had proposed average increases of 4%.\n\nThe RCN's original demand for a wage rise of 5% above inflation - equivalent at one point to 19% - was unaffordable, ministers said.\n\nThe government is ultimately responsible for setting NHS pay in England, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. NHS Employers are involved in detailed negotiations.\n\nBut now these secret contacts had been made, it was not obvious to the RCN how closely they were linked to Downing Street or other parts of Whitehall.\n\nThe approaches seemed highly unorthodox. Usually it would be obvious whether ministers or officials were making a proposal.\n\nBut all became clear on 21 February with a call from Downing Street to the Royal College of Nursing. There was an invitation to talks which would include the idea of a one-off payment for the current financial year, a key demand of the nurses. The public announcement came as a big surprise even to some civil servants.\n\nThe prime minister was signalling a change of tack. Previously there had been denials that any more money was available. In return for the invitation to talk the RCN had to agree to call off an escalated two-day strike in England affecting all care, including emergencies.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing's Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media and seemingly high public support\n\nAnd so began the chain of events which led to last Thursday's pay offer to nurses, paramedics, midwives and other health staff in England.\n\nThere were shades of international diplomacy and intrigue in the negotiations. Back-channels and deniable contacts had steered a damaging dispute into calmer waters.\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher, as on the face of it the NHS strikes and widespread disruption had seemed destined to rumble on for months. But so far, these tentative talks were only with the RCN. The other health unions, representing paramedics and a range of health staff, were irritated. They were not invited to the table.\n\nIt seemed that the government was deliberately focusing on the nurses' union because of what seemed to be rising public support. RCN's general secretary Pat Cullen had a high profile in the media.\n\nThe RCN discussions with ministers remained shrouded in secrecy. Early encounters took place at an undisclosed location to avoid the media.\n\nBut that changed on 2 March when the other unions were invited to join the talks. Assurances were given that more money was available but the unions had to agree to keep the process confidential.\n\nThe result was an intensive series of meetings at the Department of Health and Social Care in Victoria Street, close to Westminster Abbey.\n\nThey took place on the ninth floor in offices which have traditionally been occupied by ministers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay had chosen to move down one floor to an open plan office with civil servants.\n\nUnion officials were intrigued to note they were meeting in an office once occupied by Matt Hancock. It was the scene of his kiss with his then-aide Gina Coladangelo, caught on CCTV and the images leaked to a newspaper. They joked about the possible presence of cameras.\n\nThe six members of the NHS staff council, representing the main health unions, along with one other official, were used to talks with employers. Sara Gorton of Unison, who chairs the council, says of the unprecedented situation they were in: \"The process was unique in that the secretary of state was personally involved and negotiated directly with unions.\"\n\nWhat was also highly unusual was the presence of Treasury officials as well as negotiators from NHS Employers and health staff. It seemed they wanted to keep a close watch on money being offered.\n\nUnison's Sara Gorton said it was a unique situation for the health secretary to negotiate directly with unions\n\nOne union source said it became clear we were \"negotiating with people who weren't used to it\". Another added that they had \"never worked in this way before\".\n\nThere was a determination on the part of ministers to avoid leaks. Data sheets given to the negotiators had to be handed back at the end of each day. When the union team took the paperwork for their own private discussions they had to hand over their phones to prevent photos being taken. No paper was allowed to leave the building.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to demonstrate Whitehall austerity there was no regular supply of refreshments. One participant remembers \"coffee and an occasional biscuit\". Another said they decided to bring in their own glasses for water.\n\nFor lunch they were taken down to the department's canteen, escorted at all times around the building. Occasionally they nipped out for fresh air and a quick visit to a local sushi bar.\n\nThe days were long with formal talks in full sessions interspersed with negotiating teams retreating to smaller offices.

There the occupational health nurse asked her about antidepressants.\n\nMs Mackenzie said that she had believed that by this time Police Scotland, or its occupational health advisors, Optima Health, would have had access to her medical records.\n\nShe said that she was taking an antidepressant drug for anxiety and depression.\n\nThe nurse consulted a colleague and then advised her of a \"two year rule\" stipulating that probationary police officers had to be free of antidepressant drugs for a period of two years before they could be considered for employment.\n\nMs Mackenzie said she was \"heartbroken\" by this after being transparent with Police Scotland about her health.\n\nInsp Davidson called her and was said to be \"shocked and apologetic\" that she could not be passed fit for duty and that her application would be taken no further.\n\nTo make the situation worse Ms Mackenzie said the Highlands and Islands division announced, just weeks later, that it had secured funding for a three-year mental health and wellbeing project for officers and staff.\n\nPolice Scotland also confirmed a formal partnership with See Me, Scotland's programme to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination.\n\nMs Mackenzie went on to work as a nursing assistant in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nBut information she learned during her training and while seeking advice, together with a similar case reported by the Scottish Sun newspaper, prompted her to launch legal action.\n\nDespite being outside the usual time limit for making a complaint, a judge ruled that an employment tribunal could hear Ms Mackenzie's case.\n\nEmployment cases normally must be brought within three months, but submissions made by Ms Mackenzie's legal team led Judge Russell Bradley to allow the case to proceed.\n\nA preliminary hearing will now take place at a later date.\n\nMs Mackenzie's solicitor, Jay Lawson told BBC Scotland that this was one of a number of similar cases against Police Scotland, which he said was \"worrying in itself\".\n\nMr Lawson, from Dundee firm MML Law, added: \"This is a hugely important case for our client given everything she has been through but also for employees and candidates with disabilities who are discriminated against during the recruitment process.\n\n\"There is always a bigger picture in a case such as this, in relation to raising awareness.\n\n\"Ms Mackenzie instructed us following seeing one of our other cases against Police Scotland and perhaps would not have pursued the case without seeing this.\"\n\nWendy Halliday, director of mental health charity See Me, told BBC Scotland: \"While there's been real progress in recent years, we know that there is still work to do to address stigma and discrimination for Scotland's workers.\n\n\"We firmly believe that no one should be denied a role just because of their mental health, with no other consideration as to how they are, what they could bring to a role, or exploring reasonable adjustments, as required under the 2010 Equality Act, that would support them to carry out the role.\"\n\nLee Knifton, director of Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: \"We can't comment on individual cases but we know that people living with mental health conditions are still facing discrimination.\n\n\"We need employers to show leadership and ensure that their recruitment and workplace practices do not negatively affect people living with mental health conditions.\n\n\"Around one in six adults live with a common mental health disorder and we are continually learning more about mental health, so any policies in this area should be reviewed regularly to ensure that outdated practices are curbed.\" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage.\"\n\nHave you been affected by issues covered in this story?

In April, Deadline reported The Road director John Hillcoat would become the latest to tackle it.\n\nMcCarthy's \"career spanned nearly six decades and several genres, including fiction and drama\", publisher Pan Macmillan said in its tribute\n\nBorn in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1933, in an Irish Catholic family, McCarthy was one of six siblings.\n\nHe spent most of his childhood in Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer. His first novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published in 1965.\n\nMcCarthy's last two books - The Passenger and Stella Maris - were published at the end of last year. As well as his novels, he also wrote screenplays and short stories.\n\nDuring his long career, his media interviews or appearances on the red carpet were a rarity.\n\nIn 2007, McCarthy told US talk-show host Oprah Winfrey: \"I don't think [interviews] are good for your head.\n\n\"If you spend a lot of time thinking about how to write a book, you probably shouldn't be thinking about it, you probably should be doing it.\"\n\u2022 None The chaos and carnage in Cormac McCarthy's novels\n\nLast updated on .From the section Horse Racing\n\nPolice arrested 118 people over disruption to the Grand National that saw animal rights activists delay the start of the race by getting on to the course at Aintree.\n\nMerseyside Police held nine people who had managed to enter the track.\n\nThey later said there had been a total of 118 arrests for both \"criminal damage and public nuisance offences\".\n\nThat includes arrests before the race on Saturday and in relation to a protest that blocked the M57.\n\nThe race started 14 minutes late after its scheduled start time of 17:15 BST.\n\nThe 175th edition was won by Corach Rambler, ridden by Derek Fox.\n\nOne horse, Hill Sixteen, died after falling at the first fence, meaning there have been three horse deaths at the 2023 meeting overall.\n\n\"Just after 5pm a large number of protesters attempted to gain entry on to the course,\" Merseyside Police said.\n\n\"The majority were prevented from breaching the boundary fencing but the nine individuals who managed to enter the course were later arrested by officers.\"\n\nTelevision pictures appeared to show some protesters making it on to the track and trying to attach themselves to a fence, before being removed by police.\n\nDozens of others attempted to climb over or glue themselves to security fencing around the track but were led away, with police also confiscating ladders.\n\nClimate and animal rights group Animal Rising, who earlier demonstrated outside Aintree, claimed on social media their supporters entered the track to delay the race.\n\nTraffic was also blocked by protesters on the M57 motorway shortly before activists entered the track at Aintree.\n\nNorth West Motorway Police said there was \"a number of people sat on the M57\" at junction two northbound, and traffic was stopped in both directions. The road fully reopened shortly after 20:00.\n\nMerseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Paul White said: \"Today, as you've seen, there's been a significant protest in relation to the running of the Grand National.\n\n\"This began earlier this morning. There's been a number of protests outside and then that resulted earlier on today at about 5pm with numerous people trying to incur onto the course, which we, in partnership with the event organisers, and members of the public as well, have managed in the main to stop and and ultimately the event took place - albeit with a slight delay.\"\n\nMr White said it required \"significant resource\" to cover the perimeter of Aintree, with protesters attempting to access the course from a number of points around the track.\n\nHe said police had a \"proportionate\" plan in place and were able to stop \"the vast majority\" from entering the course, and those who did were removed \"swiftly\".\n\nMr White added: \"We've had to uplift our resources significantly.

whether the unborn or the terminally ill - is a measure of true progress\".\n\nShe was among the 15 SNP politicians who wrote an open letter to Ms Sturgeon the following year asking for a delay to gender recognition reforms that would allow people in Scotland to self-identify their sex.\n\nThe final vote on the proposals was held when Ms Forbes was on maternity leave, but when she launched her leadership campaign she made clear that she still had significant concerns about self-identification and would not have been able to vote for the legislation in its current form.\n\nSeveral senior figures within the Scottish government reacted with fury to her comments, with Mr Swinney saying he profoundly disagreed with her views despite also having deep Christian faith.\n\nHumza Yousaf warned that independence could only be won if the SNP sticks to \"progressive values\" and avoids a \"lurch to the right\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe bubbling tensions boiled over in a televised STV debate, when Ms Forbes launched an attack on Mr Yousaf in which she slated his performance as a government minister.\n\nMs Forbes told Mr Yousaf: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times.\n\n\"What makes you think you can do a better job as first minister?\"\n\nMs Forbes presumably did little to endear herself to the SNP hierarchy watching at home - although Ms Sturgeon says she didn't tune in for the debate - when she declared that it was time for a new generation to lead the party and that \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it is an acceptance of mediocrity\".\n\nThe remark could be read as a dig at Mr Yousaf, who to some extent pitched himself as the \"continuity candidate\", and the record of Ms Sturgeon herself.\n\nShe later doubled down by saying she would potentially have space for Mr Yousaf in her cabinet if she won the contest - but not as health secretary.\n\nMs Forbes was born in Dingwall in the Highlands, but was partly raised in India as her parents travelled there twice as missionaries, the first time when she was four years old.\n\nHer parents are reported to have been members of the more liberal Church of Scotland, with Ms Forbes claiming that she had chosen to join the Free Church after returning from India as it was \"just down the road\".\n\nMs Forbes (centre) had two spells in India during her childhood\n\nShe went to a Gaelic school while in Scotland and became a fluent speaker of the language as a child.\n\nWhen she returned to India at the age of 10, she studied at Woodstock School -

However... I do not consider the evidence enables a positive finding as to how she died, or when and where this happened,\" Deputy State Coroner Elizabeth Ryan wrote.\n\nFor most, the Melissa Caddick story began with the news that the seemingly successful financial adviser was missing.\n\nBut her life had actually begun to unravel months earlier when Australia's financial watchdog was tipped off that she had been using a friend's financial adviser's licence, having simply pasted in her own name on the document.\n\nRegulators suspect the 49-year-old stole up to $30m (\u00a315.8m; $19.5m) from more than 60 clients, including many of her family and friends, to help fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThere were overseas trips on private jets, high-end cars, designer clothes, and expensive jewellery.\n\nHer methods were not \"particularly complicated\", the coroner said.\n\nAs new clients gave her money to invest, she would pay some out as dividends to existing clients before keeping - and spending - the rest.\n\nCoroner Ryan said she was struck by the \"powerful impression of wealth and success\" Caddick made on her clients and would-be investors.\n\n\"Equally significant was the trust they had in her... almost all were either immediate family members, or close personal friends of herself and her family,\" she said.\n\nOne would-be investor recalled: \"I wanted to model myself and our family on successful people, and Melissa appeared to be successful\".\n\nBut everything fell apart on 11 November 2020 when police knocked on her door at dawn.\n\nThe last confirmed sighting of Melissa Caddick was by officers at the raid on her home.\n\nHer husband, Anthony Koletti, told police they believed she had gone for an early run the next morning. Her car and all her personal belongings had been left behind.\n\nBut she was not reported missing by Mr Koletti for more than 30 hours, and only after he had dialled in to a court hearing that she was due to attend and appeared surprised she had not turned up.\n\nPolice initially explored two theories - that Caddick was still alive and had gone into hiding to escape justice, or had taken her own life.\n\nBut the inquest heard how Mr Koletti, a hairdresser and part-time DJ, behaved erratically in the wake of his wife's disappearance, leading police to suspect he could be involved.\n\nMr Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes or any involvement in her disappearance, and police say they have uncovered no evidence to dispute that.\n\nAnthony Koletti has denied any knowledge of his wife's crimes\n\nBut an investigator told the coroner's court Mr Koletti \"didn't appear to be overly concerned\" when his wife vanished.\n\nLead Detective Sergeant Michael Kyneur also said Mr Koletti had visited a cliff top area near their home and taken a photograph of a shoe print, an action the policeman described as \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"That's a dog park. It's like saying I found a footprint on Bondi beach.\"\n\nThe inquest also heard that Mr Koletti had sent texts from Caddick's phone pretending to be her, told police he was \"too busy\" to attend an interview, and gave conflicting versions of events.\n\nFor example, he was able to provide a description of what his wife was wearing on the morning she vanished, despite also saying he had not actually seen her, police said.\n\nMr Koletti had also recounted his version of events by releasing a musical concept album containing tracks with titles such as \"Melissa Is Missing\" and \"Above the Law\".\n\nIt was \"regrettable\" that Mr Koletti had not given a \"full and frank\" account of what had happened, Magistrate Ryan said on Thursday.\n\nThe case took a grisly twist in February 2021 with the discovery of a rotting, trainer-clad foot on a remote beach 500km (310 miles) south of Sydney.\n\nExperts matched the body part to Caddick through DNA, but an autopsy couldn't determine if it was separated by force or decomposition.\n\nThe inquest heard a slew of theories to explain how it ended at Bournda", "PPL": 0.518204391002655, "PPL/lower": 0.7203287850740783, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014236384368204808, "Min-5%": 4.866294147921543, "Min-10%": 3.5622807367175233, "Min-20%": 2.2982220920781926, "Min-30%": 1.6542545529840824, "Min-40%": 1.277623725385567, "Min-50%": 1.0320397406080892, "Min-60%": 0.8627047939999606}, {"text": "efforts \"politics of grievance\" and said that every council felt hard done by, citing roads in Edinburgh that were \"worse\" than Orkney's despite the council having far more funding.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesperson said: \"First and foremost there is no mechanism for the conferral of Crown Dependency or Overseas Territory status on any part of the UK.\n\n\"We have no plans to change the devolution settlement we are supporting Orkney with \u00a350m to grow the economic prosperity of the Scottish islands, through the islands deal.\n\n\"But the government's position is that the UK is stronger united.\"\n\nOrkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472.\n\nThe islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%.\n\nA spokesperson added it was \"committed to supporting island communities\".\n\nThe Norwegian government declined to comment on the proposals.\n\nToday's vote was never about Orkney becoming part of Norway, or any of the other headlines we've seen over recent days.\n\nRather it was a chance for councillors to express their extreme frustration with what they see as the unfair deal they get from the Scottish and UK governments, with council leader James Stockan saying the islands had been failed by both of them.\n\nThe successful passing of the motion is the first of many hurdles in Orkney gaining a degree of greater autonomy.\n\nCouncil officials will now be tasked with investigating options.

If the government chooses not to do so, I will ask for these to be returned to my office so that I can provide them to you directly.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward said the risk of turning on Mr Johnson's old phone was \"minimal\", adding: \"It is perfectly possible to do that without exposing it to the potential threat.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the inquiry told the government to submit messages sent between Mr Johnson and 40 other ministers and officials during the pandemic by 16:00 BST on Thursday.\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"more than happy\" to give the unredacted material to the inquiry.\n\nThe Cabinet Office - which supports the prime minister in running the government - also holds communications between ministers and civil servants which do not involve Mr Johnson.\n\nOn Thursday, it missed the deadline and said it would \"with regret\" be launching a judicial review of the demand, but promised to \"continue to co-operate fully with the inquiry\".\n\nDefending its decision not to hand over certain messages, the Cabinet Office argued that many of the communications were \"unambiguously irrelevant\", and that to submit them to the inquiry would compromise ministers' privacy and hamper future decision-making.\n\n\"It represents an unwarranted intrusion into other aspects of the work of government. It also represents an intrusion into their legitimate expectations of privacy and protection of their personal information,\" the Cabinet Office said, in a letter to the inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC One's Question Time on Thursday, science minister George Freeman said he thought the \"courts will probably take the view\" that Baroness Hallett was entitled to decide \"what evidence she deems relevant\".\n\nBut he added \"people's privacy is really important\" and that the question of how private correspondence should be handled was a \"point worth testing\".\n\n\"I would like to see a situation where the inquiry says: 'Listen, we will wholly respect the privacy of anything that's not related to Covid. We will redact it',\" he said.\n\nLabour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the government's legal action as a \"desperate attempt to withhold evidence\". The Liberal Democrats called it a \"kick in the teeth for bereaved families\".\n\nLord Barwell, who worked as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Theresa May, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the government was making a \"bad mistake\".\n\nHe added: \"We're having the inquiry to give people confidence we're getting to the truth.

It was simply that this \"amazing chapter\" of her life had \"naturally come to an end\".\n\n\"I am a mum now and I never really gave myself a maternity leave and I got straight back into work instantly because my work is my phone and showing my life is my work,\" she continued.\n\n\"The last thing I would want to be is in a role that I can't fulfil right this moment.\"\n\nHer departure comes two months after longstanding PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani left the Boohoo Group brand, to pursue new opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, Hague announced she was taking a new direction by accepting a senior job with the label. \"I'm excited to be a creative director - I'm not an influencer any more and people can see that, it's become a lot more than that,\" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"I'm basically going to eat, sleep, breathe PrettyLittleThing - although I do that anyway\".\n\nIt was a big and controversial signing at the time, with some commentators suggesting it was unfair she had walked from the Love Island villa into a hugely influential fashion job.\n\nHague argued she had worked hard and was passionate about the brand, one she had decided to work with despite having been offered more money to go elsewhere.\n\nShe said she had turned down an offer of \u00a32 million to work with a high street brand, simply because she did not wear their clothes.\n\nAt the time she said she wanted to improve the inclusivity of the brand by creating clothes in sizes 4-30, as well as encouraging people to remove cosmetic fillers, if, like her, they had felt they'd made a mistake.\n\n\"I think for me it was a journey of accepting that you don't need to get all these things done to your face, you're fine the way you are,\" she said.\n\nHague was also criticised for her involvement with the company after PrettyLittleThing owner BooHoo was accused of paying garment workers in Leicester only \u00a33.50 per hour following a 2020 investigation by The Sunday Times.\n\nThe following year, BooHoo said: \"We recognise the risks of poor labour practices, human rights abuses and modern slavery in complex global supply chains and we are committed to establishing robust due diligence programmes and collaborating with others from the industry, authorities and NGOs to tackle poor practices and protect those people who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nLast year, Hague had an Instagram post banned after she failed to include any mention of it being an advert.\n\nIt was the third time she had been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\n\nShe posted a picture of her wearing a PrettyLittleThing dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.\n\nThe ASA said it was not \"immediately clear\" that she had a commercial interest in PLT. The brand confirmed their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the \"\u00a3ad\" disclosure in posts.\n\nBridlington Coastguard Rescue Team says technicians carried the \"very friendly\" dog back up the cliff using a rescue bag\n\nThe owners of a dog which fell 160ft (49m) down a cliff on the East Yorkshire coast say it's a \"miracle\" she's still alive.\n\nSandra Costin was walking Button the Cockapoo in Flamborough on Thursday morning when she disappeared through a gate.\n\nAfter birdwatchers spotted her running about in the cove below, a coastguard team abseiled down and rescued her.\n\n\"It's unbelievable, we can't really believe it,\" her owner said.\n\nMrs Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, was on holiday with husband Brian and walking Button off the lead through fields near Thornwick Bay Holiday Park at the time.\n\n\"I turned my eyes away from her for a second and it was done, as easy as that,\" Mrs Costin said.\n\n\"People started to help us, a man with binoculars looked over the edge and said, 'I can see a dog'.\"\n\nThe coastguard was contacted on 999, with the what3words app used to give rescuers the cliff's location.\n\nButton required a back operation after the fall but is now recovering at home\n\nMrs Costin said: \"We could see her walking around and that was such a miraculous thing, we thought she'd obviously be dead at the bottom of the cliff.\n\n\"We still don't know how she escaped because it's so far down, it's a miracle.\"\n\nPraising the team who rescued the dog, Brian Costin said: \"Everything was so organised, they abseiled down and they were there in about a minute.\n\n\"She got out of the [rescue] bag and I really couldn't believe she was alive.\"\n\nButton's owners said the dog required an operation on her back on Tuesday and was recovering at home.\n\nOwners Sandra and Brian Costin, from Oxton in Nottinghamshire, praised both the coastguard and vets for their actions\n\nMrs Costin added: \"I'll never get over not having her on a lead, but when we're in fields she likes to run around and she always comes back if you shout her.\"\n\nBridlington Coastguard Rescue Team said two technicians descended the cliff and were \"met by a very friendly dog\".\n\n\"This is an important reminder that when walking dogs on cliff top paths, ensure they are kept on a lead,\" a coastguard spokesperson said.\n\n\"Never put yourself in danger, dial 999 and ask for the coastguard.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

That's disgusting.\"\n\nThe CSA Centre says an estimated one child in every 10 will have their life damaged by some form of sexual abuse by the age of 16.\n\nThen came a day when Poppy was being physically sick. Her mother suggested they go for a walk. It was then Poppy took the leap and told her about the abuse.\n\n\"I just needed to keep her safe,\" says Poppy's mother Miranda\n\n\"It was sickening,\" says Miranda. \"She obviously saw the look on my face, and was like, 'Mum, please don't tell anybody. I don't want anything to happen to him. I love him.' She immediately said, 'It's my fault.

This was the first time she had explained to anyone exactly what her grandfather had done.\n\n\"Any sexual abuse of a child is serious,\" DC Aslan says. \"But the rape of an under 13-year-old, I don't think you get more serious than that.\"\n\nShe says the grandfather never admitted what he had done.\n\nMiranda's voice breaks as she describes being told by the police the details of what had happened.\n\n\"She was being raped by him. And she felt responsible for it. No child should feel responsible for that,\" she says.\n\n\"Poppy would never give us the full detail of what he'd done. She was trying to protect us.\"\n\nFor David, there was the distress of knowing his father was the abuser.\n\n\"He was abusing our daughter, and then five minutes later, he was having a cup of tea with us. So I felt, who is this man?\n\n\"But then equally, as a child, I had many happy memories. There was a real conflict going on in my mind.\"\n\nPoppy's parents sold their business and moved house to keep her safe\n\nIt took 18 months for the case against the grandfather, John, to reach trial.\n\nAcross England and Wales, only 12% of reported offences result in charges - according to the CSA Centre - and it typically takes nearly two years for those to get to court.\n\nPoppy's recorded interview was played, then she was cross-examined. She had just turned 13.\n\n\"I was so desperate to fight my own corner,\" she says. \"In some ways, there was a good amount of anger behind me, so telling my side of the story was incredibly important.\"\n\nIn 2018, John was found guilty on three counts, including rape, and was jailed for 13-and-a-half years.\n\nThe judge described Poppy's testimony as \"heart-rending\" and \"utterly compelling\". John's defence that she had made it up at her parents' instigation was described as \"quite absurd\".\n\nHe died in prison last year.\n\nThe conviction was important for Poppy, but so was the counselling she received. She had to wait five months for that support - now, it can take much longer. At Family Matters in Kent, where Poppy went, they have more than 300 abuse survivors waiting.\n\n\"When you want help, you want help now,\" says the charity's chief executive, Mary Trevillion - whose team spends a lot of time risk assessing people while they wait for a counsellor.\n\nShe also finds many people hide what has happened to them, only asking for help when they are adults.\n\nThe Home Office told us it was significantly increasing support for victims of child sexual abuse - including quadrupling money for victims' services by 2024-25.\n\nIt also said it recognised that child sexual abuse was an \"often-hidden\" crime, and that was why the government was making it \"mandatory for those who work with young people to report any suspicions that a child is being sexually abused or exploited\".\n\nThe small plane climbs high into the cloudless sky.\n\nPoppy is doing the skydive to raise money for a helpline that supports abuse survivors while they wait to see a counsellor.

Mining began in 1820, and continued after a merger with nearby Braichgoch slate mine until the 1970s, employing 200 at its peak.\n\nThe \"car grave\" is illuminated by shafts of light at certain times of day\n\nAfter it closed, old cars and televisions were dumped into one of the mine's two main chambers above a lake, creating the unusual scene of a rusting scrap metal heap that gets illuminated by shafts of sunlight at certain times of day.\n\n\"It's a bizarre environment, probably the one of the oddest places in the world,\" he remembered from his first visit in 2022.\n\n\"How often do you see hundreds of cars underground with lights coming onto them from the sun?\"\n\nBut to get there, he first had to pass an entrance littered with discarded bin bags that visitors had used to try to keep their feet dry.\n\nThe cavers removing graffiti and rubbish from Gaewern in March\n\n\"From about 30ft (9m) in, the spray painting starts, and it was awful,\" he said.\n\nThe graffiti gets worse in the main chamber towards the cars, he said, with more rubbish on the floor, including discarded glow sticks and human faeces.\n\n\"When you get to the end, it was just a sea of boats, inflatable dinghies everywhere,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just disgusting, really sad and disheartening.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Why destroy it for everyone else?\"\n\nCaver Gareth Jones and the other volunteers alongside the rubbish brought to the surface\n\nHe wants to educate people about the value of old mines, and fears sites like Gaewern could one day be sealed off.\n\n\"If these things keep happening, it's going to be lost to everyone forever.\"\n\nDuring his many trips to abandoned mines around mid Wales he has found a child's footprint, hobnail boots, tools, miners' gloves and a 170-year-old barrow \"still where the miner originally left it\".\n\n\"If you can't see [the value] in that, I don't know.\n\n\"I wouldn't have thought you'd have to teach people these things, but you really do in this day and age.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis week, scientists published evidence that supermassive black holes send shockwaves which distort space and time as they orbit each other.\n\nOne of the groups that made the discovery is the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOgrav) Collaboration, which is chaired by Northern Ireland native Dr Stephen Taylor.\n\nThe 35-year-old credits his love of all things space-related with seeing a partial solar eclipse during the summer of 1999, which also happened to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the first moon landing.\n\n\"The combination of those things and us learning about it at school - it just really sparked my imagination,\" Dr Taylor said.\n\nHe continued his education at Wallace High School in his home town of Lisburn and his passion for science, he says, never left him.\n\n\"I was always fascinated by it and that really played a big role in what subjects I chose for GCSE and A-level,\" he said.\n\nArtist impression: Supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies spiral in on each other, sending gravitational shock waves across the Universe\n\nWhile studying for his A-level's, Dr Taylor went for work experience at a laser laboratory in Oxford.\n\nIt is there that he had a chance encounter with another Northern Ireland scientist whose work played a large role in his later research.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he had the opportunity to attend a talk by Dame Jocelyn Bell-Burnell who discovered pulsars while a grad student at Cambridge.\n\nPulsars are dead stars which rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals.\n\n\"She gave a fantastic talk and I went up afterwards spouting the popular science I had read, thinking I knew everything,\" he said.\n\n\"But she was just really nice and kind of humoured me, if I am honest.\"\n\nPulsars would then be measured by Dr Taylor and his team in this latest paper.\n\n\"I think it's really nice that Northern Irish people are on both ends of this - because I certainly didn't hear accents like mine giving these kind of science interviews or talks,\" he said.\n\nDr Taylor then went on to do his undergraduate degree at Oxford, followed by a PhD at Cambridge looking at gravitational waves.\n\n\"At the time the idea was still theoretical. There were mainstream projects such as Ligo\" - the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory - \"but people were more focused on other aspects of physics.\n\n\"But my philosophy was, if I am going to do this I am going to enjoy it and this was what fascinated me most.\"\n\nThe first in his family to go to university, Dr Taylor said his parents always encouraged him to make choices that made him happy.\n\nFrom there, the \"Nasa-mad\" Dr Taylor had the opportunity to work at the space agency's jet propulsion laboratory before spending some time at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThis led him to begin taking up leadership roles, chairing a working group looking at gravitational waves and getting a permanent position at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHis team have been studying the signals which are emitted by pulsars and the affects of gravitational waves on their frequencies.\n\nDr Taylor described the radio beams from pulsars as being like light beams from a lighthouse. When the frequency at which they hit Earth changes, this shows gravitational waves as predicted by Einstein.\n\nHe said the most plausible cause of these waves is the orbit of supermassive black holes.\n\n\"We've seen loads of hints along the way but this is the first evidence in this kind of data set which is really exciting.\"\n\nDr Taylor said that, due to the frequencies, these black holes would be billions of times as massive as the sun and sit at the centres of galaxies.\n\n\"I never thought I would be involved in something like this. It was fun to be part of the physics and maths problems but I never thought it would get to this point,\" he said.\n\nDr Taylor said that the support of family, friends and his schools played a vital role.\n\n\"They never put up road blocks.

It is called Nevsky, after the River Neva, on which President Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg stands. According to Russian state media, St Petersburg is the main sponsor of the reconstruction of Mariupol.\n\nRussia is building new housing to replace what it destroyed\n\n\"It says on the bus: St Petersburg and Mariupol are twinned cities. There are slogans everywhere telling us that we're part of Russia now,\" pensioner Maria (not her real name) told me.\n\n\"I liked things the way they used to be. Now we live in fear. We have no idea what to expect.\"\n\nIn the houses that escaped relatively unscathed after months of fierce fighting, the Russians are replacing windows, radiators and sometimes heating and sewage pipes.\n\nHeating, running water and electricity supplies have largely been restored. Buses are running and full of passengers again, although the electric trolley bus and tram networks are still out of action.\n\nMany schools, hospitals and shops have reopened as well, although numerous traders are selling their wares straight from the pavement.\n\nMaria was particularly impressed with one school rebuilt under Russian rule: \"It's so beautiful, covered in multi-coloured squares.\" According to her, the number of children in Mariupol now is greater than schools can currently accommodate, so they have classes in two shifts: one in the morning, and another in the afternoon.\n\nRussia has imposed its own Russian-language curriculum in occupied areas - complicating efforts to get children back to school.\n\nShops have reopened and power is back, but many traders are selling their wares on the pavement\n\nThe fast-paced rebuilding of Mariupol has provoked envy in Donetsk, the regional capital occupied by pro-Russian forces since 2014, which has been neglected by comparison.\n\nThe Russia-installed head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, has even had to deny rumours that the capital will be moved to Mariupol.\n\nThere are other important ways in which Russia is putting its stamp on Mariupol.\n\nFor example, local residents are under pressure to obtain Russian passports.\n\nIvan, the Mariupol city councillor I spoke to (not his real name), said locals often formed \"huge queues\" trying to get Russian passports.\n\nThey were required if you want to find formal employment, especially with government agencies or in the public sector, he explained.\n\nAlso, they made it possible to travel to Russia without additional stringent checks known as \"filtration\", he added.\n\nUkraine believes 20,000 people died during the siege of Mariupol\n\n\"So they have deliberately created a situation where you get problems if you have Ukrainian papers, you have to deal with red tape, you have to wait. On the other hand, if you get a Russian passport, that's where your problems end: 'You're one of us now'. Things get simpler if you receive a Russian passport,\" Ivan said.\n\nMariupol is also becoming part of Russia's financial system. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya, has been phased out, and now the Russian rouble is the only currency accepted in shops.\n\nRussia is channelling huge amounts of money into pension payments for residents of Mariupol, raising them in many cases compared with what they received from the Ukrainian authorities before the war. So residents of Mariupol are able to draw two pensions - one from Russia, another from Ukraine. Naturally, it is a situation many local pensioners are happy with.\n\nRussian pensions are another reason why elderly residents are queuing up to get Russian passports - many pensioners believe the documents will be required in the future to continue receiving payments from Russia.\n\nThe media currently operating in Mariupol are also hard at work promoting a uniformly pro-Russian agenda.\n\nMany current residents of Mariupol are there because they were unable to leave the city when the Russians attacked, due to illness or old age, or because they welcome Russia's presence.\n\n\"We've suffered enough under Ukraine. Now we can breathe again,\" one social media user told me, before breaking off all contact.\n\nNew signs for the city are decked out in the colours of the Russian flag\n\nThe fast-paced campaign of reconstruction and the resulting sense of restored normality, the generous pension payments and the intensive media campaign targeting the people of Mariupol, all stimulate the spread of pro-Russian sentiment in the city.\n\n\"I'm sick of all the propaganda in the papers. They started publishing it from day one, telling us how well things are going,\" said Yuri, the engineer (not his real name). \"I feel out of place in my own city now. People are different, my city feels different now.\"\n\nCity councillor Ivan said: \"It's become difficult for me to say pro-Ukrainian things to my voters. It's tough being pro-Ukrainian in a pro-Russian environment. Unfortunately, Ukraine is losing the hearts and minds of people in Mariupol.\"\n\nThose who are still in Mariupol may be happy to see a degree of normality return to their city, but there are those who suspect Russia of pursuing ulterior motives.\n\nPopular Ukrainian journalist Denys Kazansky argues that Russia uses the new houses it has been building in Mariupol to distract attention from all the destruction it caused in the city and elsewhere in his native Donetsk region.\n\n\"If they destroyed 10 hospitals and then rebuilt one - this isn't reconstruction. It's not something they can be thanked for,\" he said.\n\n\"You can be happy as much as you like about a school being rebuilt, but what do you do with the thousands of people Russia has killed?\" he said.\n\n\"You can't rebuild them. You can't bring them back.\"\n\nIt is the third critical inspection report in a year for Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E department\n\nA third inspection in a year failed to find any major improvements at a north Wales hospital's emergency department.\n\nStaff at Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E were said to be working tirelessly to give the best care possible, but the service still requires significant improvement.\n\nInspectors said poor sepsis screening and triage and pain relief delays were putting patients at significant risk.\n\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan admitted there were still \"very, very serious problems\" at the department.\n\nInspectors' concerns about standards in the department were classified as the most significant, with minimal improvements since their two previous visits.\n\nThe report comes a month after the health board was placed back in special measures following a damning audit report, and 11 independent board members were told to quit by the Welsh government.\n\nHealthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) visited the emergency department of the hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in November after previous visits in March and May of 2022.\n\nTheir report again highlights an \"incredibly busy department, struggling with shortages of staff, high numbers of seriously unwell patients and a lack of space to treat them\".\n\nThe same could be said of emergency departments across Wales, but the fact that so little has been done to improve things since two previous visits means it remains under HIW's highest level of scrutiny.\n\nSome speciality doctors refused to review patients in the emergency department, inspectors found\n\nHIW chief executive Alun Jones said: \"This inspection found evidence of a department struggling to cope with the day-to-day demand of providing a safe service to patients.\n\n\"It has highlighted areas such as poor team working between the ED [emergency department] and other departments within the hospital which, in turn, is compounding nationally recognised challenges around patient flow.\n\n\"The health board will need to take strong and decisive action to tackle the issues identified in our inspection.

physically and mentally - as he showed glimpses of the form which has seen him long tipped to win one of the sport's four major titles.\n\nThere were tense moments in a tight first set where both players dominated on serve, Tsitsipas taking control of the tie-break to move ahead.\n\nThe second set followed a similar pattern.\n\nTsitsipas was edging the rallies as he continued to find range with his forehand, leaving Murray struggling to cope with his ferocious and consistent hitting from that side.\n\nBut, like he has done so often over the years, Murray continued to battle and managed to hold his service games with few issues as neither player conceded a break point.\n\nThat teed up another tie-break - and this time it was Murray who dominated it after finding his first serve when it mattered.\n\nMurray playing under the floodlights on Centre Court always creates a special atmosphere and the player, by now demanding more noise from the almost-capacity crowd, thrived on the energy.\n\nAfter not having a serious look at Tsitsipas's serve in the opening two sets, Murray broke to love right at the start of the third and maintained the momentum to move into the lead.\n\nHowever, there was a serious scare when he fell on the baseline.\n\nThe sound of his scream, along with the knowledge of his injury history, left the whole of Centre Court anxious and there was relief when he clambered to his feet before serving out.\n\nIt had long felt the end of the third set was the natural point to suspend the match and once that was agreed, Murray walked off to a thunderous ovation.\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\nThursday's blast damaged a number of buildings -

It's very much not over - unlike the dispute with Network Rail, which saw signallers and maintenance staff accept a deal in March.\n\nThe dispute with the train operators always looked harder to resolve than Network Rail, because of the changes to working conditions involved - the strings attached, from the unions' perspective.\n\nThere's more misery for passengers on the way - hitting confidence in railway travel again - and workers will lose more pay.\n\nTrain companies' separate dispute with the train drivers' union Aslef has never looked close to a resolution, and today it announced three more strike dates.\n\nBut today's announcement from the RMT was a surprise, and makes it hard to see how their dispute goes from here.\n\nThe RMT's strikes have less impact than they did when Network Rail was involved too. But right now, it looks like there's still plenty of disruption ahead.\n\nThe government has a significant role - it holds the purse strings. It has shown no sign recently of being prepared to allow the train companies to put more money on the table.\n\nThe last rail strike on 18 March meant only 40% to 50% of trains could run as workers across 14 train operators walked out.\n\nThe ongoing dispute has affected services since June last year.\n\nHow are you affected by the latest round of rail strikes?

However, that is still almost double pre-Covid prices in March 2020.\n\nPrice growth for ambient foods - which are goods that can be stored at room temperature - rose in the year to May from 12.9% to 13.1%. It is the fastest increase on ambient foods prices on record, said the BRC and NielsenIQ.\n\nMs Dickinson said: \"The price of chocolate and coffee rose off the back of the ongoing high global costs for these commodities.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed that the overall headline rate of inflation had fallen sharply to 8.7% in April - the first time it fell under 10% since August.\n\nHowever, the drop was less than economists and investors had expected after grocery price rises remained close to the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nIt is also still more than four times the Bank of England's 2% target rate of inflation. The Bank has lifted interest rates 12 times in a row to 4.5% in an attempt to calm price rises.\n\nBut following the higher-than-expected figure for April, some analysts speculated that interest rates could reach 5.5% by the end of the year.\n\nFood production costs have risen due to a number of factors including the cost of energy which rose following the end of Covid lockdowns, which pushed up demand, as well as Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\nRussia, which is a major oil and gas producer, was hit with sanctions.\n\nUkraine - known as the breadbasket of Europe - is one of the biggest exporters of grain in the world and has seen shipments severely disrupted because of the war.\n\nAdverse weather conditions in some parts of Europe and Africa also impacted some fresh vegetables earlier this year, leading to supermarkets introducing customer limits on sales of peppers, tomatoes and cucumber.\n\nWholesale gas prices have started to drop but retailers claim that falling production costs take time to filter through to supermarket shelves due to the long-term contracts they typically sign with food producers.\n\nMike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said: \"Food retailing in particular is competitive, so hopefully the recent price cuts in fresh foods is a sign that inflation has now peaked, albeit ambient inflation may take a little while longer to slow.\"\n\nMichael Donnelly, pictured in Belfast on Tuesday, said the police apology was 50 years too late\n\nOne of the \"Hooded Men\", Michael Donnelly, has said he does not accept a police apology over his treatment.\n\nMr Donnelly was one of 14 men arrested in 1971 during internment without trial and questioned by the police and Army.\n\nTwo years ago the Supreme Court ruled that the techniques they were subjected to would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) made a formal apology to the surviving Hooded Men on Tuesday.\n\nThe public apology came a day after the death of one of the men, Joe Clarke, at the age of 71.\n\nThe apology had been hand delivered to Mr Clarke by his solicitor on Thursday, four days before he died.\n\nMr Donnelly, who is from Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today programme that the apology is \"50 years too late\" for him and he said that it personally feels \"fairly meaningless\".\n\n\"I do not accept it - not at all,\" Mr Donnelly said.\n\nDuring their detention, the Hooded Men said they were forced to listen to constant loud static noise; deprived of sleep, food and water; forced to stand in stress positions; and beaten if they fell.\n\nThe men also said they were hooded and thrown from helicopters a short distance off the ground, having been told they were hundreds of feet in the air.\n\nPSNI Det Ch Supt Ian Saunders said the police had issued the apology for the \"actions and omissions of police officers involved in their treatment whilst in police custody in 1971\".\n\n\"The police service recognises the significant step taken today in issuing this apology,\" he said.\n\n\"It is our view this was the right thing to do to help give the Hooded Men and their families recognition about how they were treated,\" he added.\n\nSome of the Hooded Men and families gathered after the announcement was made\n\nMr Donnelly described the ordeal of being placed into a helicopter with his hands tied behind his back and being told that he was going to be pushed out from a great height over a body of water.\n\nHe also described at one stage thinking he was going to die during his detention after being severely beaten by his captors.\n\n\"I was trying to survive literally by the second, you could barely breathe at times when you were wearing the hood,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes I thought I was going to survive and then other times I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nMr Donnelly said he does not see why he should forgive anyone for his treatment.\n\nThe Hooded Men case has been the subject of multiple legal actions in the UK and Europe for decades.\n\nIn 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques used on the men amounted to torture.\n\nThis ruling was later referred to by the European Court of Human Rights in 1978, which held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment, but fell short of defining it as torture.\n\nIn 2019, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, Northern Ireland's most senior judge, said their treatment \"would, if it occurred today, properly be characterised as torture\".\n\nIn 2021, the Supreme Court issued their ruling that the men's treatment would be characterised as torture by today's standards.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK government said it acknowledged \"the pain and suffering felt by so many during the Troubles\".\n\n\"There are several ongoing legal proceedings in relation to this incident, and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nA criminal investigation has been launched into the death of an elderly woman who was struck by police escorting the Duchess of", "PPL": 0.9633538722991943, "PPL/lower": 0.8365063935119086, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002753226271218046, "Min-5%": 6.023647930107865, "Min-10%": 4.96429990085901, "Min-20%": 3.6686465512860957, "Min-30%": 2.8643202093408626, "Min-40%": 2.3083912884693567, "Min-50%": 1.9010052863191649, "Min-60%": 1.5997640346859487}, {"text": "show he's back in control.\n\nHe even has time to doodle.

It is a potentially dangerous system,\" Prof Waters told BBC News.\n\nShe added that they had not heard directly from Ofsted about the concerns the family has raised.\n\n\"It adds to the hurt, it adds to the outrage, it adds to our feeling of injustice about what happened to Ruth,\" she said.\n\nProf Waters said she had been overwhelmed by the number of people getting in touch and speaking out about their concerns with the inspection process after Ms Perry's death.\"It confirms our worst fears, that this is something that has been going on for a long time,\" she said.\n\nShe wants inspections to be paused so that an independent inquiry into what happened at Ms Perry's school, in Reading, can take place - as well as a review of the culture of inspections at Ofsted.\n\nRuth Perry, who took her own life in January, had been waiting for an Ofsted report rating her school as \"inadequate\"\n\nIn a statement, Ms Spielman outlined the changes Ofsted are making which include:\n\n\"We are not deaf to the calls for change, or insensitive to the needs of schools and their staff,\" Ms Spielman added.\n\nProf Waters said this latest response was \"totally insensitive to the situation\" and was far from \"anything like a meaningful response to the growing calls for reform\".\n\nCaversham Primary School was downgraded by Ofsted after inspectors decided that checks on staff and record-keeping of concerns about children were inadequate.\n\nUnder the current system, this means the leadership of the school is declared inadequate, as well as the school overall.\n\nThe quality of education and behaviour at the school were praised by inspectors.\n\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, most schools were inspected roughly once every four years. However all visits were put on hold in the pandemic.\n\nOutstanding schools were also exempt for eight years up to 2020, which means some are now now facing inspection for the first time in a decade.\n\nSome academy school leaders have said Ofsted is not fully considering the impact of the pandemic.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said standards on keeping children safe would not be \"watered down\", and she continued to support a \"clear one-word rating\" to inform parents' decisions.\n\nShe told MPs earlier this week she would be willing to meet Ms Perry's family.\n\nOfsted, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, inspects and reports on anywhere that provides education for young people in England - including schools, nurseries and childminders.\n\nSchools or organisations are inspected every four years or 30 months depending on their status, and are then graded accordingly:\n\nMany parents rely on Ofsted ratings to help them choose a school or nursery for their child.\n\nFollowing Ruth Perry's death, some school leaders and teaching unions called for a review of the impact of inspections and the current system of one-word grades.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Jon Coles, the Chief Executive of United Learning, which runs 72 state academy schools across England, and a former education civil servant who led the improvement of London's schools, said Ofsted is a positive thing and does contribute to public understanding of schools.\n\nHe said inspectors produce a four-page report at the end of a full inspection: \"The overall single-word grade and then the four single-word judgments are accompanied by quite a lot of detail and explanation.\"\n\nJulie McCulloch, from the Association of School & College Leaders (ASCL), said while some of proposals put forward by Ofsted are helpful, they are concerned that Ofsted \"aren't prepared to look at the single-word judgements\".\n\nShe agrees there is a longer report but \"people tend to concentrate on that grade rather than on the nuances behind it, and when we talk to our members, they say the biggest cause of stress around inspection is that reductive approach that tends to capture most of what a school does in a single word or phrase\".\n\nIn March, the National Education Union (NEU), school leaders' union NAHT, and the ASCL called for inspections to be halted.\n\nThe recruitment process for a new chief inspector of Ofsted is already under way, because Ms Spielman is standing down later this year.\n\nProf Waters says change can't wait until then: \"There is an urgent problem in Ofsted, and it needs to be dealt with urgently.

I told him this.\"\n\nEidevall said he did not feel \"comfortable with the label\".\n\nThe Swede said the situation with Cuthbert arose because the teams had disagreed about whether there should be a multi-ball system when the ball went out.\n\nEidevall was booked for his goal celebration but Hayes later said she believed he should have been dismissed for his conduct.\n\nLucy Letby, 33, is accused of murdering babies on a neonatal ward\n\nOne of nurse Lucy Letby's \"favourite ways of killing and trying to kill children\" on a hospital neonatal unit was by injecting air, a prosecutor has told her trial.\n\nMs Letby is alleged to have murdered seven babies and attempted to murder 10 others between June 2015 and June 2016.\n\nProsecutor Nick Johnson KC said experts for the prosecution had told Manchester Crown Court at least 12 of those received an air injection.\n\nOn the third day of his closing speech, Mr Johnson told jurors not to ignore the \"constellation of coincidences\" in baby deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nHe said they should \"put all the pieces of the jigsaw together\" and suggested the \"cumulative picture\" told only one story, that Ms Letby \"tried to murder or murdered these children\".\n\nMr Johnson cited the case of Child C, who stopped breathing without warning on 13 June 2015 while being treated in the unit's nursery one.\n\nHe said the collapse and death was \"inconsistent\" with all natural causes, as asserted by the medical experts in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor noted the nurse was seen in nursery one at the time of Child C's collapse, despite being allocated a baby in nursery three.\n\nHe said she was there \"with death on her mind\".\n\nMr Johnson went on to remind the jury of Sophie Ellis' evidence, who was Child C's designated nurse that day.\n\nMs Ellis told the jury how she had briefly left Child C and when she returned to the nursery, Ms Letby was standing over him.\n\nShe said the nurse told her: \"He's just had a brady/desat\".\n\nThe alleged attacks were said to have been carried out at Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nMr Johnson also said nurse Melanie Taylor had recalled being surprised at how \"cool and calm\" Ms Letby appeared as medics rushed to help the baby.\n\nHe alleged that swelling noted by a doctor in Child C's vocal cords indicated that \"something had been put down his throat\".\n\nThis was also a feature in the cases of Child E, Child G, Child H and Child N, he said.\n\nMr Johnson went on to state that another clue the jurors should consider in Child C's case was the \"massive ballooning\" to his stomach.\n\n\"It's as plain as the nose on your face that Lucy Letby must have injected air down the nasogastric tube,\" he said.\n\n\"It was, after all, one of her favourite ways of killing or trying to kill children in this case.\n\n\"There are a constellation of coincidences which can make you sure that [Child C] didn't die of natural causes and that Lucy Letby killed him.\"\n\nThe nurse, originally from Hereford, has denied all of the charges against her\n\nMr Johnson also noted how Ms Letby's defence counsel, Ben Myers KC, had repeatedly questioned witnesses about the competence of Ms Ellis, who Ms Letby had called the \"new girl\" in messages to colleagues.\n\nThe prosecutor said it was insinuated Ms Ellis was not qualified to be looking after Child C.\n\n\"It's trying to create in the impression in your minds that something was seriously wrong with the hospital,\" he said, adding: \"It's gaslighting you, doing to you what Lucy Letby did to her colleagues.\"\n\nMr Johnson later turned to the evidence heard about Child G, who was transferred to the Countess of Chester Hospital from Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital in mid-August 2015.\n\nThe court has heard she was \"clinically stable\" until 7 September, when she projectile vomited at about 02:00 BST.\n\nThe prosecution case has been that Ms Letby overfed Child G with milk through a nasogastric tube or injected air into the same tube and made two more attempts to kill her on 21 September.\n\nMr Johnson pointed the jury to what Dr Alison Ventress said about Child G.\n\nThe medic told the jury she saw blood-stained secretions coming from the vocal cords in the early hours of 7 September 2015.\n\n\"What caused the throat of an otherwise well baby to bleed?\" Mr Johnson asked.\n\n\"It is a signature of many of her attacks on these babies.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March)\n\nPiers Morgan says he is not aware of phone hacking taking place while he was editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nA High Court case against its owners, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), brought by Prince Harry and several other high-profile figures, began on Wednesday.\n\nLawyers argue that executives at the publisher knew about widespread phone hacking, but failed to act.\n\nSpeaking before the trial, Mr Morgan said: \"I've never hacked a phone. I've never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nThe long-awaited case involves allegations that the publisher of the Mirror illegally gathered information about the Duke of Sussex and a number of other celebrities to generate stories.\n\nIn written arguments put before the court, the barrister representing Prince Harry said it was \"inconceivable\" that Mr Morgan and other editors did not know about MGN journalists instructing private investigators to obtain information.\n\nMr Morgan has always denied any knowledge of phone hacking or illegal activity at the Daily Mirror when he was editor.\n\nHe was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1995 to 2004\n\nHe was interviewed by the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began. In it, Mr Morgan said he thought phone hacking - the interception of mobile phone voicemail messages - was completely wrong.\n\nHe added it \"shouldn't have been happening\" and said it was \"lazy journalists being lazy\". He said there was no evidence that he knew anything about it.\n\nAsked in the interview whether it stretched credulity that, as a hands-on editor, he didn't know what was going on, Mr Morgan replied: \"I didn't. So I don't care whether it stretches people's credulity, or not.\"\n\nThe former editor pointed out that although there were civil cases happening, none of the journalists who worked with him at the Daily Mirror have been arrested in connection with phone hacking.\n\nMr Morgan worked at the Daily Mirror for nearly a decade, but he said none of the civil cases had anything to do with him.\n\n\"I've not been called to give evidence, I know nothing about it,\" he told BBC News. Asked if he was worried about Prince Harry's legal action, he said he \"couldn't give a monkey's cuss\".\n\n\"I don't give a damn what actions he wants to take,\" he said.\n\nPiers Morgan told Amol Rajan he wasn't aware of any phone hacking while he was at the Daily Mirror\n\nIn 2015, MGN, which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, paid out \u00a31.2m in damages to eight phone hacking victims who refused to settle out of court, including Paul Gascoigne and the actor Sadie Frost.\n\nOther cases have been settled out of court so damages to individuals remain unknown.\n\nOn Wednesday, MGN apologised to Prince Harry for one instance of unlawful information gathering in relation to a story which appeared in the Sunday People in 2004, but it denied allegations of voicemail interception in all the cases being examined.\n\nMr Morgan pointed out he only worked for the Daily Mirror and had no responsibility for the Sunday Mirror or Sunday People, or other titles.\n\nA MGN spokesman said: \"Where historical wrongdoing has taken place we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.\n\n\"MGN is now part of a very different company. We are committed to acting with integrity and our objective in this trial is to allow both the business and our journalists to move forward from events that took place many years ago.\"\n\nMr Morgan presents a show on TalkTV following his controversial exit from ITV's Good Morning Britain.

Watch: OceanGate boss Stockton Rush on his passion for the seas - and for taking risks\n\nStockton Rush was the chief executive of OceanGate, the firm which runs the Titanic voyages, and the company confirmed he was on board.\n\nHe was an experienced engineer who had previously designed an experimental aircraft and worked on other small submersible vessels.\n\nMr Rush founded the company in 2009, offering customers a chance to experience deep sea travel, and made global headlines in 2021 when it began offering trips to the site of the Titanic wreck.\n\nFor $250,000 (\u00a3195,600), his company offers passengers the opportunity to get an up-close glimpse of what remains of the famous ship.\n\nParticipants travel some 370 miles (595km) on a larger ship to the area above the wreck site, then do an eight-hour dive to the Titanic on a truck-sized submersible known as Titan.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in 2022, he defended the business model, and said the ticket price was a \"fraction of the cost of going to space and it's very expensive for us to get these ships and go out there\".\n\nA 2017 feature written for the website of Princeton University, where he studied, reported that Mr Rush goes on every OceanGate dive.\n\nMr Rush was married to Wendy Rush, who is the great-great-granddaughter of Isidor and Ida Straus, who died in the Titanic wreck after letting women and children escape before them.\n\nMike Reiss, a writer and producer of The Simpsons, went on a Titanic dive in a different OceanGate submersible with Mr Rush.

Some analysts have predicted interest rates will peak at 6.5%, but some have said they may rise to as high as 7%.\n\nThe theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, and more worthwhile for people to save, people will spend less, which will in turn lead to price rises to slow.\n\nMr Bailey said in his speech to executives at the same Mansion House event \"it is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive\".\n\nHe added that while the UK economy has failed to grow beyond its pre-pandemic level, there had been \"unexpected resilience\" in the face of external shocks, such as Covid and the war in Ukraine, with low levels of unemployment and avoiding a recession to date.\n\nBut the Bank of England's boss highlighted that \"tightness\" in the labour market, with many businesses struggling to find enough workers, has contributed to price inflation being \"more sticky than previously expected\".\n\n\"Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target,\" he added.\n\nThe Bank of England has previously warned big pay rises are contributing to the UK's still-high rates of inflation, but there have also been accusations that some sectors have been profiteering by overcharging customers.\n\nLast week, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed supermarkets had sought to increase profits from selling fuel, increasing their margins by 6p per litre on average between 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe chancellor said \"delivering sound money is our number one focus\", before he delivered his speech focusing on plans for pension fund reforms.\n\nMr Hunt pledged the plans could provide a \u00a31,000-a-year pensions boost to the typical earner who starts saving at 18.\n\nWhile UK pension pots are the largest in Europe, worth \u00a32.5trn, defined contribution schemes currently invest 1% in unlisted equity, limiting returns for savers and funding for businesses, the Treasury has claimed.\n\nThe chancellor revealed an agreement with leading pensions firms to put 5% of their investments into early-stage businesses in the fintech, life sciences, biotech and clean technology sectors by 2030.\n\nThe so-called \"Mansion House Compact\" has been backed by Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal & General, Aegon, Phoenix, NEST, Mercer, M&G and Smart Pension.\n\nAhead of the event, Mansion House organisers said talks had taken place about security at the venue over concerns of protests. A source told the BBC the event was not disrupted.\n\nOn the night a dozen of Donald Trump's Republican rivals spoke at the same event in Iowa, only one challenged the former president head on - and he was roundly booed.

US officials said he had agreed to a visit to Washington at the talks.\n\nMr Qin said Taiwan was the \"most prominent risk\" for China-US relations and described the Taiwan issue as one of \"China's core interests\", state media said.\n\nChina sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control, but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland with its own constitution and leaders. US President Joe Biden said last year that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, a move condemned by Beijing.\n\nMr Qin greeted Mr Blinken on Sunday morning at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, a lavish estate that typically hosts visiting dignitaries.\n\nThe two shook hands as they stood before their respective flags, then sat down with their delegations at long tables to begin their meetings.\n\nThe greeting was business-like, underscoring the chilly relations that have developed between the two superpowers in recent years.\n\nThe US had been lowering expectations for the trip and both sides have made clear they do not expect any major breakthrough.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, trade disputes over advanced computer technologies, the fentanyl drug epidemic in the US and Chinese human rights conduct are all topics the Americans were expecting to be discussed.\n\nChinese officials have reacted coolly to Mr Blinken's visit, questioning whether the US is sincere in its efforts to mend relations.\n\nIt is not clear whether he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nMr Blinken is the highest-ranking US government official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.\n\n\"If we want to make sure, as we do, that the competition that we have with China doesn't veer into conflict, the place you start is with communicating,\" Mr Blinken told reporters on Friday.\n\nLater he said he hoped to meet President Xi in the next few months.\n\nA meeting between President Biden and Xi Jinping in Bali in November briefly eased fears of a new Cold War, but since the balloon incident high-level communication between the two leaders has been rare.\n\nAfter health inspectors considered closing a maternity unit over safety fears, the BBC's Michael Buchanan looks at a near", "PPL": 0.611605167388916, "PPL/lower": 0.7228108851978993, "PPL/zlib": 0.00016937279628604707, "Min-5%": 5.656547431852303, "Min-10%": 4.129014454635919, "Min-20%": 2.6986498816672047, "Min-30%": 1.9565233847896906, "Min-40%": 1.508210509869933, "Min-50%": 1.2176464929907524, "Min-60%": 1.0187925240040092}, {"text": "Rovers sparked outrage by signing Goodwillie in January 2022 and a loan move back to Clyde also collapsed.\n\nRape Crisis Scotland described the Raith Rovers move as another \"clear message of disregard\" to survivors of rape and sexual violence.\n\nThe forward was released without playing a game in September 2022, with Raith Rovers admitting it \"got it wrong\" by signing him.\n\nIn February this year, Northern Premier League side Radcliffe FC, based in Bury, Greater Manchester, released the striker after one game following a public outcry.\n\nFour months later, Goodwillie's contract with Australian semi-professional club Sorrento FC was rescinded.

March.\n\nSir Keir also said he did not have any discussions with Ms Gray while she was investigating former PM Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Cabinet Office will update MPs later on its investigation into the circumstances around her resignation with a written statement.\n\nThe report is not expected to be the final judgement on Ms Gray's departure, which will come from the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\n\nThe watchdog is to recommend how long Ms Gray, who probed lockdown gatherings in Downing Street, should wait before being allowed to take up the job with Labour.\n\nSir Keir accused the government of using the issue to try and deflect from the local election campaign, saying it should be focusing on the cost-of-living crisis instead.\n\n\"[The public are] not sitting at their breakfast talking about Sue Gray, they're talking about their bills,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\nAsked whether Ms Gray had broken any code of conduct, Sir Keir said: \"Firstly I had no discussions with her whilst she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm confident she hasn't broken any of the rules.\"\n\nUnder the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.\n\nSenior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government.\n\nThe body provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.\n\nHowever, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by its recommendations.\n\nA long delay could hamper attempts to have Ms Gray in place well before the next general election, which is widely expected next year, to help Labour prepare for government if it wins power.\n\nCabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin has previously said Ms Gray's talks with Labour may have breached civil service rules, including the requirement to inform Acoba before a job offer is announced, and to clear contact with opposition parties with ministers.\n\nMs Gray became well known after she was chosen to look into the Partygate scandal last year.\n\nShe has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team, since joining the civil service in the 1970s.\n\nMs Gray resigned from the post of second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in March, after it emerged she had been offered a job with Labour.\n\nLabour has insisted it did not approach Ms Gray until after her Partygate report was published.\n\nBur Mr Johnson and his allies have seized on Labour's job offer to claim Ms Gray's investigation when he was in power was an attempt to smear him.\n\nHer report was critical of the senior political and civil service leadership, saying they \"must bear responsibility\" for the culture at No 10 during Covid lockdowns.\n\nIt contributed to Mr Johnson's downfall as prime minister, prompting numerous Conservative MPs to call on him to resign.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has told a court he is suing the publisher of the Daily Mirror to stop \"absolute intrusion and hate\" towards him and his wife.\n\nPrince Harry was giving evidence against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) over illegal newsgathering claims, including phone hacking.\n\nHe was choked-up as he finished giving evidence for a second day, and said it had been \"a lot\".\n\nMGN denies it used illegal methods to gather stories about the prince.\n\nAt London's High Court, the prince explained he started discussions about possible legal action after a chance-meeting in France in 2018 with David Sherborne, now his barrister.\n\nThe prince said before then he had no concerns over any particular newspaper stories due to unlawful activity because it \"was all contained in the Palace\".\n\nWhen asked about his discussions with lawyers after that chance meeting with Mr Sherborne, Prince Harry said he had wanted to put a stop to the \"absolute intrusion and hate that was coming towards\" him and the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHe said he also wanted to \"see if there was any way to find a different course of action, rather than relying on the Institution's way\".\n\nBut in cross-examination, Andrew Green KC, the lawyer representing the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People, suggested Harry had not found a single story that came from phone hacking.\n\nHarry replied \"there is hard evidence to suggest an incredible amount of suspiciousness\" over how stories were sourced and he believed burner phones were used \"extensively\", referring to phones that can be disposed of so no records are kept.\n\nPrince Harry alleges about 140 articles published between 1996 and 2010 - from his childhood into early adulthood - contained information gathered using unlawful methods, with a sample of 33 stories written about him being considered by the civil court.\n\nMany of the stories the prince claimed were obtained illegally concerned his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.\n\nIn a 2006 Sunday People article Ms Davy was said to have been \"screaming for half an hour\" at him on the phone and \"blew her top\" over his visit to a Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club in Berkshire.\n\nChelsy Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010\n\nAsked where he thought the information on her screaming had come from, the prince said: \"At this point, knowing that my girlfriend's number was bizarrely in the hands of Mirror journalists, that they probably looked through her call data and saw missed calls, late calls\u2026 and managed to put together a story based on that.\"\n\n\"It was very suspicious that they had her number,\" he added, and he did not believe she would have given the Mirror Group or any journalists her phone number.\n\nThe prince told the court he once found a tracking device on Ms Davy's car at a time when the press were reporting on what was described as a \"make-or-break\" holiday for the couple.\n\nHe also highlighted another article in The People in 2007 which reported a \"Palace source\" saying the couple had been having \"monumental\" rows and their relationship was \"in crisis after a string of bitter bust-ups\". Again he said it was \"incredibly suspicious\" as he had never discussed his relationship with the Palace.\n\nMr Green responded by saying we are in the \"land of total speculation about where this information might have come from\".\n\nThe couple broke up in 2010 after a six-year on-off relationship. She attended the prince's wedding to Meghan in Windsor in 2018.\n\nThe prince was also asked about The People publishing photographs of the prince, a friend Mark Dyer and the late TV presenter Caroline Flack meeting up.\n\nAt the time he suspected one of his friends had leaked the details after they were confronted by photographers. In turn this led him and his brother William to stop talking to Mr Dyer for some time afterwards.\n\nHowever he said: \"I now believe the information came from our voicemails\u2026 Even those I trusted the most, I ended up doubting.\"\n\nAsked how he would react if the court concluded that he had never been hacked by any MGN journalist, Harry said that he had been hacked on an \"industrial scale\" and he would \"feel some injustice\" if he did not win", "PPL": 0.7687876224517822, "PPL/lower": 0.6951906798502696, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002063305481620457, "Min-5%": 6.255501742456474, "Min-10%": 4.793571144926782, "Min-20%": 3.2825424455488807, "Min-30%": 2.4299446768597592, "Min-40%": 1.8927026544048617, "Min-50%": 1.530512265252898, "Min-60%": 1.2797395759034622}, {"text": "doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants.\n\n\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\"\n\nThe companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective.\n\nThey said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information.

He was buried a day before Thursday's sentencing.\n\nMiller apologised to the community and turned to address Ms Graber's relatives seated behind him.\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry for the distress I have caused you and the devastation I have caused your family,\" he said.\n\nPleading with the judge to forego the maximum sentence, Miller said: \"I don't want to be institutionalised so long that I forget who I am and where I come from.\"\n\nProsecutors said the evidence showed both Miller and Goodale had bludgeoned Ms Graber with a bat during the attack in Fairfield, a town of fewer than 10,000 people that lies 100 miles (160km) south-east of the state capitol, Des Moines.\n\nThe day after the attack, police found the mother-of-three's body hidden under a tarpaulin, wheelbarrow and railway sleepers in a local park where she used to walk after school.\n\nIn a police interview, Miller described frustrations with the way Ms Graber taught Spanish.\n\nHe said his marks in her class were lowering his Grade Point Average, an important score during applications for US colleges and scholarships.\n\nMiller met Ms Graber at Fairfield High School on the day of the murder to discuss his poor grade in her class.

The firm should have generated more revenue after acquiring Complex in 2021, which runs the music site Complex and other brands, he added.\n\n\"I could have managed these changes better as the CEO of this company and our leadership team could have performed better despite these circumstances.\" he said.\n\nIn her own memo to staff, parts of which she shared on social media, Buzzfeed News editor-in-chief Karolina Waclawiak said the company should have tried to build a business around its news site earlier, describing the closure as \"avoidable\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Substitute goalkeeper Archie Mair, brought on to replace Sam Slocombe in the 120th minute, crucially saved spot-kicks from Darren Oldaker and Jeff King before Cedwyn Scott sealed a dramatic 4-3 shootout triumph. Victory for the 161-year-old Magpies, who were founder members of the Football League in 1888, ended their four-year non-league exile while defeat consigned Chesterfield to a sixth season in the National League. Ruben Rodrigues had bounced a volley off the turf and over goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons to level at 2-2 in the second half of extra time to ensure the showdown would be decided from the spot. Armando Dobra's curled finish had restored Chesterfield's lead in the first period of 15 additional minutes after an enthralling game ended 1-1 at the end of normal time. A calamitous start from Notts goalkeeper Slocombe - which had the Magpies defending a rare indirect free-kick inside the box after just two minutes - cost them dearly as his challenge on Andrew Dallas allowed the striker to put Chesterfield ahead from the spot. The Spireites had Notts scrambling to stay in touch at the break as the side that won a club-record 32 league games during the regular season struggled to muster a meaningful response. Sam Austin sent a shot over the bar from the edge of the area and Connell Rawlinson wastefully steered a header wide for a much-improved Notts after the break. Liam Mandeville squandered a late chance to seal victory moments before experienced Notts midfielder John Bostock caught Fitzsimons out with a set-piece that skipped in at the near post. Dobra edged the Derbyshire club back ahead three minutes after the restart and, after Macaulay Langstaff and Rawlinson went close to again restoring parity, it was Rodrigues who sent the final to a shootout.\n\u2022 None Relive the National League promotion final as it happened After four years and three failed play-off attempts - including defeat by Harrogate in a 2020 promotion final played behind closed doors at Wembley during the Covid-19 pandemic - Notts finally secured their English Football League (EFL) return at the end of a record-breaking season. Luke Williams' side were pipped for automatic promotion and the title by Hollywood-funded Wrexham, who topped the table with an all-time high 111 points. The 107 points the Magpies collected to finish second would have got them straight up as champions in every other season before this one. The club-record wins total and 117 goals in a campaign - which included a record 25-game unbeaten league run between September and February - would have counted for nothing if they had lost at the national stadium. Chesterfield finished one spot below Notts in the table, but the gap between the two was 23 points. They were the only side, other than Wrexham and Notts, to have a spell at the top of the table after the first month of the season - and they pushed Notts to their limits at Wembley in an incredible energy-sapping game. Chesterfield were presented with a bizarre chance almost immediately after kick-off when County conceded an indirect free-kick in the penalty area. Notts set their entire side up a yard in front of the goalline to block King's effort from the left of the penalty spot, but the uncertain start by the Magpies quickly got worse. Slocombe raced out to try shut Dallas down on the edge of the area, but caught the Spireites forward as he tried to lift the ball beyond the keeper. Dallas collected himself and went straight down the middle to beat Slocombe from the spot to put Chesterfield ahead after five chaotic minutes. Nervy Notts struggled to match frenetic Chesterfield for much of the first half, but Austin had a chance to level from close range in the 17th minute when he stretched to meet a lofted cross from Aaron Nemane.

With three runs required and less than five overs remaining, Cummins deflected Ollie Robinson towards third man, a diving Harry Brook fumbled and Australia had an incredible victory.\n\nA series that has already lived up to the hype continues with the second Test at Lord's on 28 June.\n\u2022 None 'Cummins is The Boss but England can come back'\n\u2022 None Relive an incredible day with all the best clips\n\u2022 None Watch the highlights on Today at the Test\n\nThis was not just an homage to the epic contest on the same ground 18 years ago, but the perfect opening to the most anticipated Ashes series in a generation.\n\nFrom the moment Zak Crawley crunched the first ball of the series for four, this Test had everything: England's daring first-day declaration, Root's attempted reverse-ramp off Cummins from the first ball of day four and the fascinating clash of style between the two teams.\n\nBut none of that could match the nerve-shredding drama of the final hour, played out in front of a buoyant crowd that had earlier waited until 14:15 BST for rain to pass and play to begin.\n\nEngland have been involved in some thrilling Tests since Stokes took charge, but none with the stakes as high as this. In truth, they wasted chances throughout, but have shown enough quality, endeavour and bravery to suggest they have what it takes to get back into the series.\n\nFor Australia, the narrow win just about vindicates their cautious approach to combatting England's Bazballers. It was fitting that captain Cummins, the architect of the safety-first plan, played the vital role on the final day.\n\nThis was magnificent sporting theatre, whetting the appetite for the rest of the series and for the Test between England and Australia's women, which begins at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nCummins and Lyon get revenge 18 years in the making\n\nIn 2005, Australia arrived on the fourth morning needing 107 with only two wickets remaining and almost got them thanks to the efforts of their last three batters - Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz.\n\nFrom a position almost as hopeless, Cummins and Lyon launched their own rescue mission and this time got Australia over the line.\n\nThe tourists had been almost inert for most of the day. At 107-3 overnight, they did not shift from a neutral gear. Khawaja, who made a century in the first innings, added only 31 runs from 116 balls and looked immovable.\n\nStokes somehow conjured the slower ball from his fragile body and Root held on to Carey to make England favourites, but fearsome competitors Cummins and Lyon refused to yield.\n\nRoot had already failed to cling on to a low caught-and-bowled chance when Cummins had six and the captain would later make him pay by crashing 14 from a single over.\n\nIn the next over, Stokes flung himself at a catch that would have matched his grab in the 2019 World Cup, but this time could not hold on.\n\nThe new ball was belatedly taken, but Australia's confidence grew. For every time the outside edge was beaten, a single was pinched. Cummins slapped Robinson past a flying Ollie Pope at cover, Lyon twice belted Stuart Broad down the ground for fours.\n\nThe outside edge was beaten, England kept the field back, James Anderson was ignored. Australia were within one hit of victory for more than two overs.\n\nWith three required, Cummins fended off a short ball and the flailing Brook could not prevent the boundary. Australia ended on 282 - their target back in 2005 - and the brilliant Cummins threw his bat in the air to begin wild celebrations.\n\nEngland had lost two of their past 12 Tests and one of those, against New Zealand in Wellington in February, was by just one run after they had made the Black Caps follow on.\n\nThis, though, will test the resolve of their new attitude under captain Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum like never before. Not because their swashbuckling style has failed its first examination by Australia, but because they were so close to winning and it is their own errors that have cost them.\n\nThey missed eight chances of varying difficulty in the field, four of which were by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow. Most crucially, Bairstow failed to move for an edge when Khawaja had only five on the fourth evening.\n\nQuestions will linger over Stokes' decision to declare on the first evening and the fitness of Moeen Ali, who was badly hampered by a cut on his spinning finger throughout the match.\n\nIt was also telling that Stokes, who is managing a left-knee injury, did not bowl himself until the 70th over of the second innings and that Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, was not trusted with the second new ball.\n\nNo team has come from behind to win an Ashes series since 2005. Stokes' England have shown they can get at Australia, but they must be near-perfect in the remaining four Tests if they are to win the urn for the first time since 2015.\n\u2022 None How did Messi win the World Cup with Argentina?

Police have told them that they cannot rule out the possibility of a so-called copycat attack, says Michael Tsifidaris, who speaks for the community here.\n\nHe's smartly dressed in a business suit, but looks exhausted. It's clear that he's still deeply shaken. Two of his friends were killed in the attack.\n\nHe tells us he spent Thursday night with survivors in hospital, and at the police station. But he also comforted relatives as they waited in a hastily arranged emergency centre for news of their loved ones.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine - a group of people are sitting together during an evening in the church, reading the Bible, singing, praying together. Then they spend a couple of minutes together to talk to each other after the meeting, Then, all of a sudden, a scene of love becomes a scene of hate and death.\"\n\nThe fact that the killer was a former member of the Jehovah's Witness community here makes the tragedy particularly hard to bear.\n\nThere are about 4,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in and around Hamburg. The community is divided into smaller congregations, each with their own meeting place, known as a Kingdom Hall.\n\nDetectives investigating the mass shooting have said the killer left the Jehovah's Witnesses on terms which were \"not good\".\n\nMr Tsifidaris says he doesn't know why the man left, didn't know him personally, and appears reluctant to talk about him.\n\nThose who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses are often \"disassociated\" or cut off by most members of the community; a practice sometimes referred to as \"shunning\".\n\nThe police have revealed they recently received an anonymous letter, in which the author warned the attacker had a gun, was mentally unstable and harboured anger against religious groups, including the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"He left the community two years ago and now, all of a sudden, he's showing up and is acting against all the principles we stand for,\" says Mr Tsifidaris.\n\n\"What we know is that in the religious context, there is a community he knows, there is a community he was part of, so this is a community he focused his hate on. He knew the premises, he knew the arrangements.\"\n\nFor now, the community is meeting online.

It's the city that took the life of one son and left her only other child seriously injured.\n\nHer one scant comfort - that one died saving the life of the other.\n\nMaksym and Ivan volunteered to fight when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. At the time Maksym was 22 years old and Ivan just 18.\n\nIvan, the younger brother who still carries the scars, says they were inseparable. \"He was always with me and I with him. For me, he was the dearest person.\"\n\nIvan shows me videos and photos of them together - in a trench, in a military vehicle, trying to get some rest.\n\nAs time passes, you see two smiling, handsome young men change, gradually appearing wearier as war strips away their innocence.\n\nThe two brothers were inseparable - fighting and resting together at the front\n\nTheir last moments together were spent engaged in brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut. \"It was impossible to sleep there. We were being attacked 24/7,\" Ivan says.\n\nThe brothers' unit was trapped in a windowless room of a building. They'd had to punch through walls to make firing positions. That's when they received an order to pull back.\n\nIvan recalls the moment before he was wounded. \"I remember I was reloading; I came out from behind a wall and there was a flash. I was paralysed and I fell.\"\n\nHe says he then felt the warmth of the blood flowing from his injuries to his face. He didn't think he'd survive. \"I thought I was done; I'll bleed out and that'll be it.\"\n\nBut Maksym came running to his rescue and dragged him back inside a building for cover.\n\n\"He revived me, took out my broken teeth and began to give me first aid,\" says Ivan. That included piercing a hole in Ivan's throat to prevent him from choking.\n\nIvan shares a video of his brother tenderly wiping the blood away soon after the explosion. Another widely shared clip shows Ivan struggling to walk with a gaping wound to his face, but still clutching his Ukrainian flag: a symbol of bravery and resistance in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nIvan has no doubts that he would have died if it weren't for Maksym's actions. \"My brother didn't let me die. He saved me.\"\n\nIvan (seen here recovering in hospital) had a hole cut in his throat by his brother to help him keep breathing\n\nMaksym urgently called on the radio for help. But the first medics that tried to reach him were all killed in their vehicle when it was struck by a Russian anti-tank missile. It took another nine hours before Ivan could be rescued.\n\nAnd then came Maksym's extraordinary act of self-sacrifice. Rather than travel with his brother to safety, he volunteered to stay in Bakhmut, to lead their unit.\n\nStill fighting there a week later, Maksym was killed by a Russian sniper.\n\nIn Ukraine the funerals of soldiers are now as constant as the sound of artillery on the front line. But they're not all like Maksym's. Alongside his grieving family, the entire town of Tomakivka had come out to pay their respects.\n\nThey knelt as the funeral procession made its way to the cemetery - some clasping flowers or Ukraine's flag. The prayers and sombre music accompanied by tears and sobbing.\n\nSerhii (left) and Lilia were supported by the entire town at their older son's funeral\n\nFor the past year, Maksym and Ivan's parents had been living their sons' battles vicariously. Lilia and Serhii were having sleepless nights too - waiting anxiously to hear from their boys. They'd often receive a short text to reassure them, says Lilia - \"We're good, mum.\"\n\nBut then came the news they'd been dreading.\n\nLilia weeps over Maksym's coffin before it's finally lowered into the ground - accompanied by a volley of gunfire. \"We still can't believe it. My soul is torn,\" Lilia tells me after the funeral. She says her only reason to continue living is for her younger son.\n\nShe tells me Maksym had the chance to leave with Ivan, but he would not abandon their younger, less experienced comrades.\n\n\"He's a hero. He's an angel. He's sunshine. He would never leave his brother even though he knew he would die himself.\"\n\nUkraine won't say how many lives have been lost in this war. But look around the cemetery and you soon realise the entire country is paying an extremely heavy price.\n\nMy brother gave his life for our freedom. Unfortunately, freedom comes with blood\n\nAt this one small graveyard, in this one small town, there are rows and rows of freshly dug graves surrounded by flowers. Maksym's was one of three soldiers' funerals the local priest was conducting that week.\n\nFor Roman, who was once himself a soldier before taking holy orders, it was harder than most. He is a family friend and prayed with Maksym and Ivan's parents for the safe return of their boys, whom he knew.\n\n\"You often have to bury soldiers,\" said Roman. \"But not your friends.\"\n\nAt the funeral, Ivan is still clutching the Ukrainian flag which he carried when wounded - signed by his comrades including his brother.

The force has declined to comment.\n\nWildcat Haven, based in St Asaph, Denbighshire, has said he suffered \"physiological and psychological trauma\", and has made a number of claims about police actions.\n\nWildcat Haven's lawyer, Joseph Morgan, said the group found the animal dehydrated, soaking wet and close to death as a three-week-old kitten in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nBelieving he was a Scottish wildcat, he was taken to an enclosure in Conwy for rehabilitation before eventual release.\n\nPlans to release Finlay in spring 2022 were derailed on Valentine's Day in February that year, when officers took him from the farm claiming he was being held without a licence.\n\nWildcat Haven claimed no licence was required to rehabilitate Finlay.\n\nMr Morgan said: \"North Wales Police acted excessively in seizing Finlay from Wildcat Haven's care and holding on to him for over four months.\n\n\"In doing so, they undermined months of hard work that went into rehabilitating Finlay for release into the wild, meaning that Wildcat Haven has had to start from square one in their journey to see Finlay in the wild again.\"\n\nWildcat Haven is also unhappy police do not believe Finlay is a wildcat, but a domestic tabby with some wildcat genes.\n\nThe assessment could pose problems for the group if it does release Finlay into the wild, as it could be committing an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.\n\nFinlay was not returned until 28 June 2022, allegedly in a \"very poor state\". Wildcat Haven said it took more than six months to bring him back to good health.\n\nIts director Emily O'Donoghue said: \"Finlay was wrongly seized as no licence is required for the rehabilitation and release of a Scottish wildcat.\"\n\nShe claimed that he was kept \"in a quarantine cage for four-and-a-half months\", and on his return he was \"emaciated\".\n\nWildcat Haven said Finlay was discovered in the Scottish Highlands as a kitten\n\n\"The police returned him because they said he was a domestic tabby cat, even though an assessment of him arranged by the police gave him a score which should have identified him as a Scottish wildcat, according to the scientific literature,\" Ms O'Donoghue said.\n\nThe police, she claimed, caused Finlay to \"suffer unnecessarily\" and delayed his release.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for his freedom,\" she said.\n\nWhile North Wales Police has declined to comment on Wildcat Haven's claims, it has previously said it kept Finlay at a special facility where it had regular visits and vet assessments.\n\nIt said there was no evidence of disease and Finlay displayed traits of domestic cat behaviour.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nWhat started with pictures in Edinburgh, took Ross Burns to locations all around the UK including the Finnieston Crane in Glasgow\n\nWhen Ross Burns first took a photo of one of his son's toy cars while on a daily walk he did not think it would turn into an obsession that has seen him complete 1,000 days of taking pictures in different locations.\n\nIt started as a lockdown project in 2020 but he caught the bug and it turned into a three-year project capturing images of his son's Hot Wheels miniature cars in locations from Edinburgh Castle to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe 43-year-old, from Edinburgh, said he started taking out the toy cars when he went for walks with his six-year-old son Daniel.\n\nHe posted the pictures on his Instagram account and received an encouraging reaction.

Time is the nicest gift that you can give people, especially your kids.\n\nJanine's train journey was cheaper because she bought tickets in advance\n\nMy total week's spending was \u00a3399.19 excluding my regular costs and extra income from selling things.\n\nWhen you break it down day by day, it seems crazy. But this wasn't a normal week for me. When the kids are off you end up spending much more money.\n\nI hope people realise that there are ways to still enjoy your life without having to fork out loads. Promotions, vouchers and apps can bring the price down. When you're doing it everyday it really adds up.\n\nAs told to Yazmina Garcia.

Brecon Beacons National Park will now be calling itself only by its Welsh name, Bannau Brycheiniog\n\nThe decision was aimed at promoting local culture and heritage, as part of a wider overhaul of how the park is managed.\n\nThe new campaign group - called \"Our Bannau Brycheiniog/Brecon Beacons\" - is made up of range of businesses in the fields of tourism, farming, green energy, hospitality and retail.\n\nHelen Howarth says losing the English language name will hurt tourism\n\nThey said they were proud of operating in a bilingual nation and believed \"this tradition must be protected and respected\".\n\nThey said they were also seeking legal advice about whether they could mount a High Court challenge, which would argue the park's rebrand conflicts with the 1993 Welsh Language Act obliging public bodies in Wales to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis.\n\n\"I firmly believe that losing our identity as the Brecon Beacons National Park will be detrimental to us all and especially tourism, hospitality and trade,\" said Helen Howarth, who owns a self-catering accommodation business.\n\nThe group has penned an open letter to park bosses calling on them \"to reinstate the bilingual Bannau Brycheiniog/ Brecon Beacons National Park name and brand\".\n\nThey say a number of the campaign's signatories are part of a scheme to be official ambassadors for the park and were \"not even notified about the renaming and rebranding project before its launch on 17 April\".\n\nNigel Kilgallon says the name change seems like \"an act of sabotage\"\n\nNigel Kilgallon, who runs a B&B in Brecon and is a town councillor, said the name change highlights the disconnect between the authority that runs the national park, and the local community.\n\n\"You could call it a trademark, you could call it intellectual property, you could call it a marketing tool. All these things that it could be. But it's also the home of the people that live here. Our Brecon Beacons,\" he said.\n\n\"And so to just change it, just seems like an act of sabotage.

The government said its aim was to improve Covid surveillance of travellers arriving at London's main airport from China by helping to detect potential new variants.\n\nThe government said an average of 99 people per flight had been tested, totalling 3,374 passengers.\n\nDuring that period, 14 positive cases were identified, but none was deemed to be a variant of concern.\n\nThe DHSC said from Friday, 17 March \"passengers aged 18 or over travelling from mainland China and arriving at Heathrow Airport will no longer be invited to take a voluntary test on arrival\".\n\n\"The ending of this enhanced surveillance is in line with international partners such as the EU who are reducing border measures to monitor new variants from China\" .\n\nOfficials said the government would maintain a range of contingency measures to \"enable detection, and swift and proportionate action, for potential new harmful variants\" should the need arise.\n\nLast December, ministers confirmed that passengers arriving to England from China would have to provide a negative Covid test before they boarded their flights.\n\nThe Chinese government was reporting about 5,000 cases a day at the time, but analysts said the numbers were vastly undercounted - and that the daily caseload could have been closer to one million.\n\nOther countries around the world such as the US, France India also implemented testing.\n\nWhile the decision only affected English airports, the government said that despite their being no direct flights from China to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, that it was working with the devolved administrations to ensure the policy was applied UK-wide.\n\nIn January, China reopened its borders to international visitors for the first time since it imposed travel restrictions in March 2020 while officials declared later that month that the country's current wave of Covid-19 infections was \"coming to an end\".\n\nChina's National Health Commission stopped publishing data on Covid cases and deaths on 25 December after the relaxation of its zero-Covid policy and in February declared a \"decisive victory\" over the pandemic.\n\nWhen this cow ran onto an interstate, police in Michigan relied on a cowboy to lasso the suspect bovine.

In 2022, raw sewage was dumped into rivers and seas for 1.75 million hours - or 825 times a day on average.\n\nUntreated sewage contains bacteria such as E.coli and viruses like hepatitis, that can be harmful to animals and humans. Swimming in water where untreated sewage is discharged can lead to serious illnesses such as stomach bugs, which may cause diarrhoea and vomiting, as well as respiratory, skin, ear and eye infections.\n\nWildlife including fish and insects can also experience kidney issues and die from sewage pollution.\n\nWater UK, the body which represents England's nine water and sewage companies, apologised on behalf of the industry for not \"acting quickly enough\".\n\nRuth Kelly, the organisation's chair, told BBC News: \"We're sorry about the upset and the anger from the fact that there have been overspills of untreated sewage onto beaches and into rivers over the past few years.\n\n\"We're sorry that we didn't act sooner, but we get it.\"\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nEnvironment Agency chairman Alan Lovell welcomed the companies' apology but said he wanted to \"see action and a clear plan for delivery\".\n\nThe companies said on Thursday they were ready to spend \u00a310bn raised from investors to tackle the problem - but admitted customers could see a \"modest\" bills rise as firms looked to recover the costs over time.\n\nWater regulator Ofwat said on Thursday it would review the commitment to assess what impact it could have on consumers before spending begins.\n\nThere are many ways that water companies can spend the money to reduce sewage spills including:\n\nBut the water companies have come under significant criticism for suggesting bills could be raised to pay for this investment whilst continuing to pay out profits to shareholders.\n\nDowning street has said that water companies should put \"consumers above profits\".\n\nThe prime minister's deputy official spokesman said the apology from water companies was welcome but acknowledged that more needed to be done.\n\n\"And we've been clear throughout that we don't want to see things disproportionately impacting customer bills, especially given we know that there are people up and down the country who are struggling with the cost of living, which is why we provided the help we have in that area.\"\n\nIt is not yet known how much bills could rise with the new investment as Ofwat will not make a decision until the end of 2024 on spending plans.\n\nMarine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) welcomed \"the long overdue apology\" but said the investment should not be paid for through higher bills.\n\n\"The UK public has already paid for environmental protection from sewage - but we're yet to see it. And whilst the water industry rakes it in, this investment pledged by Water UK must come out of water company profits, not from the bill payer,\" said Izzy Ross, campaigns manager at SAS.\n\nCommons Environmental Audit Committee chair, Conservative MP Philip Dunne, told the BBC he hoped Ofwat would approve the investment plan.\n\nLast year his committee warned the UK's rivers were a \"chemical cocktail\" of raw sewage, microplastics and slurry.\n\n\"The water and sewage sector is in listening mode and has provided a promising plan to tackle poor water quality and take vital steps to improve the country's ageing sewerage infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nJim McMahon MP, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said the government was partially to blame for the situation.\n\n\"Thirteen years of Tory government failure has left a broken system, capped by an appalling track record of inaction. The Conservatives are the problem not the solution,\" he said.\n\nThis sentiment was supported by Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey. \"The one apology missing here is from the environment secretary,\" he said. \"This Conservative government has been pathetic on stopping sewage discharges into rivers.\"\n\nThe Green Party called for water and sewage companies to be brought back into public ownership.\n\nSewage spills can cause algae blooms which starve fish and other organisms of oxygen\n\nWater UK said the companies also committed to cutting spills by up to 35% by 2030 and sharing real time data on how often sewage was being spilled into rivers and seas.\n\nBut this is not a new pledge, as the government announced last month the sharing of data would be a legal requirement for water companies by 2025.\n\nWater UK also said companies would reduce the number of sewage spills by up to 140,000, compared with 2020, when there were more than 400,000 spills.\n\nEnvironmental campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (Wasp) said that promise was \"meaningless\" unless the volume being spilled is also reduced. Currently, water companies are only required to monitor if a spill is happening but not how much is released.\n\nPeter Hammond, from Wasp, told Radio 4's Today programme: \"All they are promising to do is reduce the number of spills, we still don't know whether they are trickles or tsunamis of sewage going into the river[s]\".\n\nWater and sewage services in the UK are devolved and in Scotland and Northern Ireland are provided by government-run companies, in Wales it is not-for-profit.

The decision is a \"victory for unborn children\", said Katie Daniel, Florida policy director of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nBut in a 4-3 vote, the justices also approved a November ballot initiative that, if approved, would overturn the six-week ban and enshrine broad abortion access in the state's constitution.\n\nThe decisions have sharpened the glare of the political spotlight on the Sunshine State, and set up perhaps the highest stakes abortion fight since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022.\n\nThe six-week ban in Florida - the country's third most populous state - may affect more women than any other statewide ban implemented since the repeal of Roe.\n\nJust over 84,000 women received abortions in Florida last year, state data says.

It was like a big work of art and he was its creator.\n\nAt close quarters in the abbey, the orchestra and choir were remarkable, the music welling up like a tidal wave of sound. It was bouncing off the stained glass windows.\n\nThe piece by William Byrd had all the aching melancholy and stillness that you suspect King Charles would really have enjoyed. Handel's Zadok the Priest, full of drama and anticipation, was a real spine-tingler.\n\nThere was also the most eclectic collection of people in the congregation. There were hundreds of charity workers, US First Lady Jill Biden, President Macron and rows of celebrities, such as Joanna Lumley, Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, and hello, it's Lionel Ritchie.\n\nMany of the guests had been inside the abbey for hours before it started, which meant some of the best-dressed queues ever seen for the toilets.

The polling excluded London, which did not hold local elections in May.\n\nMr Westwood said: \"The evidence suggests that the vast majority of voters were able to present an accepted form of ID at the May elections.\n\n\"But it also shows that some people were prevented from voting in polling stations due to the requirement, and significantly more did not attempt to because they lacked the required ID.\n\n\"Overall awareness was high and achieved in a matter of months, but we can see that people who lacked ID were less likely to know they needed to show it.\n\nThe commission plans to publish its full election report in September.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Owain Emanuel brings the characters of Bluey to life\n\nOriginally from Bridgend but now a professional designer in Melbourne, Australia, Owain Emanuel has been working on children's cartoon series Bluey since 2016.\n\nThe show has become a sensation across the world, including in the UK since its first appeared on our screens two years ago.\n\nBut what is it like to work in the world of animation? And how does Owain help bring the characters to life?\n\nOwain knew since he was very young that he wanted to draw, in some form, when he was older.\n\n\"I'm drawing all the time, and people sometimes ask, what would I do if I wasn't drawing or working like an animator, and I don't have a clue\u2026 I've loved drawing my whole life,\" he said.\n\n\"I went to the University of South Wales in Cardiff and studied animation. After that I moved to London to work on the Mr Bean cartoon. That was my first animation job.\"\n\nGone are the days of using paper and pencil to draw; now Owain creates using a computer\n\nEven though he was happy in London and had no plans to move, in 2016 two huge moments changed Owain's life.\n\nJoe Brumm, an animator in Australia, emailed Owain asking if he would like to go over there to work on his idea for a cartoon.\n\nThen Owain met his partner, Kristen, an Australian.\n\nJoe's idea, about a cartoon family of dogs, was given the green light and a year later Owain found himself working on Bluey as the series' chief designer in Brisbane.\n\nOwain and Kristen now have a daughter called Nia\n\nBluey has since become a phenomenon. It has won awards galore in Australia and has become a firm favourite with children in countries including the UK.\n\nBut even Owain admits \"nobody knew how big the show was going to become\".\n\nHow does his work as designer and rigger fit in with the whole process of bringing the cartoon to life on-screen?\n\nBluey has become a sensation across the world\n\n\"My role is to take the props and the characters the art director designs and construct them using special software, ready for the animators,\" Owain explained.\n\n\"If the character needs to talk, walk, hold props, turn 360 degrees\u2026 we need to design everything, from the shape of the mouth to the shape of the hand, until you've created everything the character needs to do.\n\n\"You're like a mechanic building the inside. The lower part of the body needs to move the top of the head, and the top of the arm needs to be able to move the lower part, which then moves the hand. Then, the animators work to bring the characters to life.\n\n\"It's a big job because every character on Bluey has over 150 mouth shapes, over 200 hands, and 40 feet.\"\n\nEach episode lasts seven minutes, but every finished programme requires four months of work from start to finish.\n\nAs well as working on Bluey, Owain has also worked on other children's cartoons in Australia. But, he says it can be quite hard to get a job as a designer in the world of animation.\n\nOf course even though you need talent there is an element of luck and who you know.\n\n\"I was lucky, I did well in university, so they sent me to London for an industry night, and I met with a person who was working on the Mr Bean cartoon. And with luck, my final project looked like the style of Mr Bean, so I was asked to work on the series.\n\n\"Every job I've worked on since has been through people I know.\"\n\nOwain and the rest of the crew that work on the third series of Bluey\n\nOwain has now been in Australia for six years and has a young daughter Nia with Kristen.\n\nThe Bluey production team is waiting to see if there will be a fourth series of the cartoon.\n\nIn the meantime, Owain has set up an animation company with a co-worker and they are looking for new projects.\n\nBut he said he also wanted to work on something that reminds him of Wales.\n\n\"I've never done anything in the Welsh language,\" he said. \"I'm so far from home - my family are all back in Wales and I miss Wales so much.\n\n\"I try and read to Nia in Welsh so I want to draw Welsh-language books.

For many the first indication that something terrible was happening was the noise.\n\nFrancisco McKnight told the BBC it was a miracle that he is alive. The only warning he had was the sound, he said - he had never heard anything like the noise of the wind on Friday night and never wants to again.\n\nHe took one look outside and then ran into his bathroom and got into the bath tub. He said that was what saved him.\n\nThe only part of his home that is still standing are parts of two of the bathroom walls.\n\nThe tornado lasted just five to 10 minutes he said, and he sat in the tub as the rest of his home was ripped away.

introduce such a system if it wins power.\n\nBut shadow women and equalities secretary Anneliese Dodds has now said medical diagnosis upholds \"confidence in the system\".\n\nShe added that the requirement also helps people access NHS support.\n\nIn a article for the Guardian, she wrote that Labour would streamline the current medical diagnosis rules, calling them \"demeaning\".\n\nThe new Labour position appears to be a compromise that has emerged from a party event in Nottingham over the weekend to discuss policy.\n\nIt opens up a split with Scottish Labour, which has previously voted to remove the medical diagnosis requirement and has since confirmed it \"continues to support the de-medicalisation of the process in Scotland\".\n\nUnder current rules, people who want to change legal sex need to provide a medical report showing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\n\nThis is defined by the NHS as a \"sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity\".\n\nApplicants also have to provide evidence of living full time in their acquired gender for at least two years.\n\nSome campaigners say the the requirement is excessively bureaucratic and invasive, and have long argued for a non-medical process - known as self-identification - instead.\n\nThe government ruled out adopting this approach in 2020 after a consultation, but has reduced the fees and moved the process online.\n\nLabour pledged to introduce a self-identification system under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn and the policy was in the party's 2019 general election manifesto.\n\nSir Keir reaffirmed the 2019 manifesto commitment to \"introduce self-declaration\" in a June 2021 video for LGBT website Pink News.\n\nHowever, Ms Dodds has now confirmed that the party would keep the need for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, calling it an \"important part\" of the process for obtaining a gender recognition certificate.\n\n\"Requiring a diagnosis upholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that it also helped refer trans people into the NHS for support services, citing low levels of awareness about how to access them.\n\nShe added that Labour wanted to avoid the \"mistakes\" made by the Scottish government, whose new law to ditch medical reports is subject to an ongoing legal wrangle with the UK government.\n\nScottish ministers' legislation - endorsed by Scottish Labour in the Scottish Parliament - showed a \"cavalier approach\", she added.\n\nHowever, she added the current requirement to apply to an \"anonymous\" panel to obtain a certificate should be replaced, calling it \"demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice\".\n\nInstead, she said it \"should be enough\" for registrars to sign off the application, based on diagnosis from one doctor.\n\nThe LGBT+ Labour group said the party's new position would be a \"huge step forward\" for trans people over the current government stance.\n\nBut it added the party was \"signalling a retreat on their policy of de-medicalised self-ID for the trans community at the next general election\".\n\nLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a patron of the group, told the BBC it would push for further changes, including giving non-medical professionals such as social workers the power to \"externally verify\" someone's acquired gender.\n\nRosie Duffield, who had threatened to quit as a Labour MP over the party's previous stance, said she welcomed the retention of medical reports, calling it the \"core thing\" demanded by women's groups.\n\nMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, has opposed self-ID as a way for trans people to gain access to single sex spaces such as domestic

WATCH: \"We feel so excited, we feel so happy\"\n\nA group of Ugandan children is on the verge of glory after reaching the final of hit UK talent show Britain's Got Talent, where they have won over the judges and the public with their dazzling dance moves and bubbly personalities.\n\nThey have already made history after becoming the first act to be given a \"golden buzzer\" by one of the judges before they had even finished their performance. This sent them straight through to Wednesday's semi-final, where they received most public votes, meaning they are now among the 10 acts taking part in Sunday's final.\n\nThe group of six children aged between six and 13 all come from impoverished backgrounds in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where they were taken in and cared for by their guardian-turned manager Dauda Kavuma.\n\nHe told the BBC that he hopes their success can encourage other children living in similar circumstances.\n\n\"We feel so happy to keep doing this and to bring hope to all the children around the world who are in the ghetto, who are disadvantaged, who are less privileged - that they can make it in life.\"\n\nWhile they are winning over a new audience in the UK, the Ghetto Kids are already a global internet sensation and performed at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBut one of the group, Priscilla Zawedde, 13, told the BBC that winning the TV show - and the \u00a3250,000 ($313,000) prize money - would mean \"a bigger house for everyone\".\n\nSome 30 children currently share a five-bedroom house in Kampala, where they are looked after by Kavuma.\n\nHe set up the Inspire Ghetto Kids Foundation in 2007 to care for street children in the Kampala neighbourhood of Makindye and told the AFP news agency that having a bigger house would be a \"dream\" as the children would have more space.\n\nThey currently rely on donations from well-wishers, earnings from their social media posts as well as fees for live performances.\n\nKavuma also started life on the street before he was given a chance by a man who spotted him playing football and asked him if he wanted to go to school.\n\n\"He let me join his team and helped me pay my school fees. He was someone who helped me without knowing me. So from that day, I promised myself that when I grow up I'd hope to help a child one day,\" Kavuma told the BBC.\n\nBut he then switched to music, which he is now using to transform the lives of others.\n\n\"Most people thought street kids... have no value in society but I thought otherwise,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I use music, dance and drama to transform the underprivileged in the ghettos?'\" he says.\n\nAkram Muyana, 13, told the BBC that dancing had always been his way of escaping reality after his father died.\n\n\"Whenever I dance, I feel so happy, and my stress goes away.

Under such an arrangement, doctors provide remote monitoring of patients in their home, who would otherwise have to be admitted to hospital.\n\nThey have been used in recent years for patients with conditions such as respiratory infections and heart problems.\n\nThere will also be the option for hospitals to open emergency escalation beds if needed, NHS England said.\n\nSarah-Jane Marsh, from NHS England, said the measures would help the service increase its \"resilience\" during the busy winter months.\n\nMatthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation - which represents hospitals - said the measures were based on \"sound evidence\", but questioned whether there will be sufficient funding and staff to make the plan work.

One British man whose sister managed to be evacuated overnight told the BBC she felt overwhelming relief to have escaped Khartoum, where food and water have become scarce because it is not safe for people to leave their homes.\n\nHe said at one point she and 13 others had only four dates and one egg left to share between them.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: British nationals board UK military plane to be evacuated from Sudan\n\nBrigadier Dan Reeve, the most senior military official overseeing the evacuation, said there was capacity to evacuate about 500 people a day.\n\nHe defended the decision not to escort people to the airport, even though some other countries have done this with their nationals.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"This is not a race to get it wrong. In my professional judgement it would not be safe to bring people together in one location in Khartoum and seek to extract them.\n\n\"We've seen incidents of convoys being attacked.\"\n\nAround 120 British troops are supporting the evacuation at the Wadi Seidna airstrip. Downing Street said the British military would defend the airfield in Sudan but clarified efforts would be made to avoid \"active engagement\" with other forces.\n\nThe government is also considering a seaborne evacuation from Port Sudan, some 500 miles from the capital.

Later, on the cutthroat revenge fantasy Vigilante, she performed a Fosse-inspired chair routine.\n\nBut the highlight for many was the full 10-minute version of All Too Well - the song she allegedly wrote about actor and ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal - which was performed in a flowing red overcoat as snowflakes fell across the stage.\n\nThroughout, the audience sang every word in devoted adoration. The feeling was very clearly mutual.\n\nAt one point, Swift interrupted her own stage patter to deadpan: \"I'm trying to tell you I love you and I'm babbling.\"\n\nEarly reviews for the concert have been enthusiastic, highlighting the extensive setlist and cinematic production values.\n\n\"The queen of pop reclaims her throne,\" declared The Times, adding: \"If there is a danger that shifting between 10 such different albums could lead to an uneven experience it is somehow avoided here, with Swift managing to produce a cohesive experience despite the constantly changing outfits and backdrops.\"\n\n\"She managed to make it look easy, enjoying the journey as much as the Swifties in attendance did,\" agreed local news outlet Arizona Central.\n\n\"The Swifties are certainly going to be Enchanted,\" said Hello magazine, in a review peppered with Swift's song titles.\n\n\"It's been a long wait back to this moment, but karma is, indeed, a queen - and this was worth the wait.\"\n\n\"The achievement is often staggering\" concluded Billboard, \"with costume changes, set-piece upheaval [and] vulnerable moments in a crowd of thousands and sing-alongs that will rival the scope of any tour this year.\"\n\nThe only criticism, from fans and reviewers alike, was that Swift's third album Speak Now was given short shrift, with only one song on the setlist (the understated ballad Enchanted, performed in a ballgown, pictured above).\n\n\"She paid this album dust,\" wrote one concertgoer on Reddit. \"The dress was beautiful though.\"\n\nRumours are already circulating that the Speak Now section will be expanded during the tour, with Swift expected to release a re-recorded version of the album as part of her ongoing campaign to regain control of her masters.\n\nFor now, the 52-date tour is restricted to the US.

The BBC has spoken to those men sent home, and learnt that some prisoners were offered \u00a31,500 to leave - and some plan to come back.\n\nEach week, a small crowd gathers at the razor-wire fence tucked around the back of Albania's Tirana airport.\n\nThe narrow runway beyond it, pinched between jagged black mountains and the high grey walls of the border police unit, is where UK deportation flights land - closely watched by the families waiting at the fence.\n\nIt takes hours for the deportees to appear, trickling slowly through the gate to be met with hugs, shy smiles and tears.\n\nDeportation flights to Albania have increased since the country signed a joint co-operation agreement with the UK last December, to \"deter and disrupt illegal migration\".\n\nThe UK government's Home Office says more than 1,000 people have been returned since then: around half of them voluntary, the rest a combination of failed asylum seekers and foreign offenders.\n\nThe BBC spoke to dozens of people on several of these deportation flights last month, and found that most came from UK prisons.\n\nSome had been offered money in return for agreeing to deportation, and were released from prison before serving their minimum sentence, under an existing scheme used for foreign offenders.\n\nAlbanian police confirmed that a majority of those forcibly returned this year were convicted of crimes in the UK.\n\nOne cheerful 30-year-old man said he had been serving a six-year sentence for drug offences, and was released for deportation after serving just two of them - a year before he would have been eligible for parole.\n\nHe asked us to hide his identity, so we're calling him Mark.\n\nThe man who we're calling Mark asked the BBC not to identify him\n\n\"The immigration officer came to see us,\" he said. \"They ask if you want to go back [to Albania] or stay in UK. They explained that if you go back, they take one year off from your sentence.\"\n\nMark was also offered \u00a31,500 in financial support to return home, under a separate programme called the Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS).\n\nA UK government document clearly states that the scheme is \"a financial incentive\" offered to foreign prisoners \"on the proviso that they co-operate with deportation and waive their right to appeal against it\".\n\nOther prisoners we spoke to on the deportation flights last month had been given the same amount.\n\nMark was deported under the UK's Early Release Scheme (ERS), used for foreign prisoners of all nationalities.\n\nERS does not require the consent of prisoners, but several Albanian deportees we spoke to, including Mark, said their deportation and sentence reduction were presented as voluntary.\n\n\"It was my choice to come back,\" Mark told me. \"Nobody forced me. They offered it to me. They said, 'You decide if you want to go or want to stay'.\"\n\nWe asked the Home Office to confirm how many Albanians had been deported under the ERS since the start of last year, and how many had received financial incentives to co-operate, but it said it did not publish these statistics.\n\nA spokesperson said in a statement: \"The UK and Albanian governments work together to take every opportunity to intercept the work of people smugglers and speed up the removal of Albanians with no legal right to be in the UK.\"\n\nIn March, Edi Rama (right) became the first Albanian prime minister to visit 10 Downing Street\n\nLast year, the government's Nationality and Borders Act extended the early release period allowed under the ERS from nine months to a year. One of the aims of that change, according to a Home Office brief, was to increase the number of removals.\n\nThe same Act also abolished the expiry date for unserved sentences, meaning that prisoners who return to the UK illegally will have to serve the rest of their sentence, no matter how much time has passed - increasing the deterrent for people like Mark.\n\n\"I'm not going back there again,\" he said. \"I'm not going to prison. Now I'm going to look for work, I'm going to be a good guy.\"\n\nBut several of those on the deportation flights last month said they were planning to return to the UK within weeks or even days, despite what many described as a new hard-line approach by police there.\n\n\"They're rounding up Albanians now,\" one man said. \"It's very difficult for Albanians to stay in the UK because police stop you in the road. They don't want us now.\"\n\nHe said he had been sent back to Albania after police stopped the car he was in and found he was undocumented.\n\nHe is still planning to return.\n\nAnother man said he had already been back and forth to the UK three times. \"It's not a problem for me,\" he said. \"I'll go back whenever I want.\"\n\nFor many of those we spoke to, it was economic opportunities that drew them to the UK.\n\nNot for Azem, though - a slight man in his late twenties, who seemed lost inside his clothes.\n\nAzem - not his real name - talks to the BBC's Lucy Williamson on a disused railway track\n\nAzem - not his real name - told us his story on condition of anonymity. He also insisted we meet somewhere remote, where he wouldn't be overheard.\n\nOn a disused railway track over a pretty river sunk into the rolling landscape outside Tirana, Azem talked, his hands trembling.\n\nHe showed me documents detailing his removal from the UK, and the rejection of his asylum claim. He told immigration officials he had fled Albania after gang members put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him for his political activities.\n\nHe was returned back to Albania against his wishes last month.\n\n\"I'm afraid because the same situation can happen again,\" he said.", "PPL": 0.9043633937835693, "PPL/lower": 0.8003905759571063, "PPL/zlib": 0.00024548409168935107, "Min-5%": 6.393449731901581, "Min-10%": 4.8739019573903555, "Min-20%": 3.4539160675990845, "Min-30%": 2.6787674913383075, "Min-40%": 2.153948285541791, "Min-50%": 1.7781219279806868, "Min-60%": 1.5003494483446065}, {"text": "introduction of spin, it also proved their downfall as Dean made the breakthrough and Ecclestone quickly took the second New Zealand wicket.\n\nNew Zealand regrouped through Amelia Kerr, captaining the side for the first time in ODIs, and Georgia Plimmer.\n\nHowever, Cross returned to remove them both lbw in an exceptional spell that sparked a New Zealand collapse of eight wickets for 68 runs.\n\nEven after a collapse of their own, the efforts of Jones and Dean ensured the work of England's bowlers did not go to waste.\n\n'Jones and Dean give lesson for us all' - reaction\n\nPlayer of the match Amy Jones on TNT Sports: \"I was just trying to keep it as simple as possible and focus on one ball at a time.

Here's how the drama is playing out on Capitol Hill and a guide to what comes next.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, President Joe Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy finally reached a deal to raise the amount of money the US can borrow, avoid a default on the national debt, and limit federal spending for the next two years.\n\nNow the pair are busy selling their weekend agreement to Congress. First up is the US House of Representatives, which is scheduled to hold a vote on the agreement on Wednesday evening. Republican and Democratic leaders there believe that even with some defections on the left and right, they have the votes to pass a bill - perhaps by a comfortable margin.\n\nThe legislation then moves to the Senate, which will pose new challenges to the agreement. Unlike the Republican-majority House, Democrats control the upper chamber with 51 out of its 100 seats. According to parliamentary rules, 60 votes are required to approve most bills - so some combination of Democratic and Republican votes will be needed.\n\nThose rules also offer individual senators broad powers to slow consideration of legislation for days. With the date when the US will hit its borrowing limit estimated by the US Treasury to be Monday 5 June, that leaves little margin for error or delay.\n\nOne conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, has threatened to use \"every procedural tool\" to slow consideration of the deal. He, and other recalcitrant Republicans, may be mollified if Senate leadership allows the chamber to vote on changes to the deal.\n\nIf any of those changes are approved, however, it could threaten the carefully negotiated balance in the legislation and would almost certainly push final approval past 5 June.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The debt ceiling explained - in under 90 seconds\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate are on board with the deal as it has been negotiated, and will be working to ensure that a final vote is taken quickly and the debt-limit deal reaches Mr Biden's desk for signature into law before a default can occur.\n\nFor the moment financial markets appear to have calmed as the prospect recedes of the global economic chaos that would result from the world's biggest economy defaulting on its $31.4 trillion (\u00a325tn) debt.\n\nThat could change, however, the closer the US approaches that Monday debt-limit deadline without significant progress in Congress. In 2011, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the US credit rating when similar brinksmanship pushed the nation close to its borrowing limit.\n\nThe path to selling the deal has been a rocky one so far. It became clear on Tuesday that some conservative hard-liners in the House would oppose the agreement.\n\nAt a press conference held on the steps of the US Capitol earlier on Tuesday, 11 members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus railed against what they viewed as insufficient spending cuts and budget limitations in the compromise legislation.\n\n\"This deal fails completely,\" said congressman Scott Perry, the leader of the group. He said those who stood with him \"will be absolutely opposed to the deal and will do everything in our power to stop it\".\n\nThey also dodged when asked whether they would call for Mr McCarthy's removal - a step that would escalate the rift forming among Republicans in the House.\n\n\"No matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning for what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow,\" congressman Chip Roy of Texas, another Freedom Caucus member, warned.\n\nThere may also be some defections in both the House and the Senate from left-wing Democrats, who have complained about how the proposed budget cuts fall exclusively on social programmes and objected to the new work requirements on some recipients of low-income aid.\n\nThe Democratic hard-liners, however, have been less organised - and less vocal in their objections - than their conservative counterparts.\n\nA Sheriff's office in Wisconsin responded to an unusual call by a driver, after a bobcat got stuck in a car grille.\n\nOfficials say the animal was unharmed and eventually set free back at the location where it entered the car.\n\nAn eyewitness has captured the moment a large funnel cloud tore through a neighbourhood in the city of Greenwood, Indiana.

Watch: From police interrogations to trial testimony, who is Alex Murdaugh?\n\nA powerful South Carolina lawyer has been found guilty of murdering his wife and son to distract from his multi-million dollar financial crimes.\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before convicting Alex Murdaugh, 54, of two counts of murder at the end of a six-week trial.\n\nHe faces a long prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.\n\nMaggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot at close range near the dog kennels on their family estate on 7 June 2021.\n\nAlex Murdaugh stood impassively as he learned his fate during Thursday evening's hearing in Walterboro.\n\n\"Today's verdict proves that no-one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law,\" said South Carolina's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alan Wilson.\n\nThe case - chronicling the downfall of a family born to power and privilege - has captivated the country, inspiring documentaries on Netflix and HBO.\n\nMurdaugh was once an influential personal injury attorney in the state, and for decades until 2006 his family members had served as the leading prosecutors in the area. Such was their influence that the jurisdiction became known as \"Murdaugh Country\".\n\nBut the trial heard that for years he had been stealing from his law partners and clients to feed an addiction to painkillers and an extravagant lifestyle.\n\nMurdaugh had pleaded not guilty to killing his wife and youngest son in an attempt to conceal years of financial corruption - fraud that he himself had acknowledged in court.\n\nAfter the 12-person jury's verdict, dozens of spectators gathered outside the back of the court where officers ushered a handcuffed Murdaugh quickly into a black van.\n\nReporters shouted questions, though he remained silent. As police tucked him inside the vehicle, one man behind the media line shouted that he was praying for him.\n\nMaggie Murdaugh, pictured here with Alex, was said to be a devoted mother\n\nIt took more than a year for investigators to arrest Murdaugh as they untangled the complex case.\n\nIn a risky move for any murder defendant, Murdaugh took to the witness stand, trying to convince the jury that someone angry over a deadly 2019 boating accident involving Paul could have killed his son to seek revenge.\n\n\"I would never hurt Maggie, and I would never hurt Paul - ever - under any circumstances,\" Murdaugh testified.\n\nThe case against him was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. No direct evidence - things like a murder weapon, blood on his clothing or an eyewitness - was presented at trial.\n\nInstead the prosecution focused on an incriminating Snapchat video taken by Murdaugh's son just before the murders.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPaul and his mother were killed at the kennels on the family's sprawling hunting estate, known as Moselle.\n\nFor 20 months after their murders, Alex Murdaugh told law enforcement repeatedly he had not been at the dog kennels at all that evening, and was at home napping.\n\nBut in the Snapchat video filmed by Paul just minutes before the shootings, the defendant's voice could be heard in the background.\n\nOn the stand at trial, Murdaugh admitted he had lied, saying his years-long addiction to painkillers had put him in a paranoid state.\n\nThe court also heard of Murdaugh's bizarre attempt to stage his own death in an insurance fraud scheme just three months after he murdered his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. The hitman he hired botched the shooting and the bullet only grazed his head.\n\nAlex Murdaugh (right) murdered his wife, Maggie, and his youngest son Paul\n\nLocal resident Jessica Williams, 38, stood outside the court watching the proceedings on the phone with her six-year-old daughter.\n\n\"I am so happy,\" she told BBC News after the verdict was announced, adding: \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down [in 1995]. This was the same thing.\"\n\nEarly on in the proceedings, Judge Clifton Newman ruled that prosecutors could bring in evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes.\n\nInvestigators say he stole nearly $9m from clients and colleagues to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle. And at trial, Murdaugh admitted to wide-scale theft.\n\nProsecutors argued it was these crimes that drove him to murder - that he thought the deaths of Maggie and Paul would gain him sympathy and stave off a reckoning over his other misdeeds.\n\nMurdaugh and his defence team had argued in court that this theory was ludicrous and financial problems would never have led him to murder.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified that on the night of the murders Alex Murdaugh had asked Maggie, who had been at the family's other property in nearby Edisto Beach, to return to Moselle.\n\nMaggie much preferred Edisto to Moselle and hadn't planned on leaving, her sister Marion Proctor told the court. But Murdaugh's elderly father was dying, and so Mrs Proctor encouraged her to support him.\n\nAlex Murdaugh and his two sons were fond of hunting, and Moselle was home to a collection of guns.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Murdaugh had used one of these - a .300 Blackout assault-style rifle - to kill Maggie, and another weapon to kill Paul. But they were unable to find either firearm and produce them at trial.\n\nMaggie was shot four or five times with a rifle and their son was shot twice with a shotgun, the trial heard.\n\nReaper drones are full-size aircraft designed for reconnaissance and surveillance\n\nThe US has accused Russia of reckless behaviour after an American drone crashed into the Black Sea following an encounter with Russian fighter jets.\n\nBefore the collision, Russian jets are said to have dumped fuel into the path of the drone, which the US says was in international airspace.\n\nThe damaged MQ-9 Reaper drone was brought down by the US after it became \"unflyable\", the Pentagon said.\n\nRussia has denied its two Su-27 fighter jets made any contact.\n\nThe key question is whether the encounter was merely an attempt by Russia to disrupt the US drone and its work - or whether it was a deliberate attempt to bring it down.\n\nUS military officials said the incident happened at about 07:03 Central European Time (06:03 GMT) on Tuesday and the confrontation lasted around 30-40 minutes.\n\nSeveral times before the collision, the fighter jets dumped fuel on the drone in a \"reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner\", it said in a statement.\n\nPentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder told reporters the drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable so we brought it down\", adding that the collision also likely damaged the Russian aircraft.\n\nHe said the jets were able to land following the incident.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBrig Gen Ryder said to his knowledge the Russians had not recovered the drone.\n\nThe United States", "PPL": 0.6922045946121216, "PPL/lower": 0.7815761161516781, "PPL/zlib": 0.00019297591151717913, "Min-5%": 5.854614505580828, "Min-10%": 4.503442916215635, "Min-20%": 3.0415745212862717, "Min-30%": 2.2098514153242887, "Min-40%": 1.709437682441365, "Min-50%": 1.379679091143643, "Min-60%": 1.1527812266805746}, {"text": "could affect fuel prices and consumer confidence in the months ahead.\n\nIAG said flight capacity was back to 94% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year.\n\nFares were up by about 9.5% on average, and revenue reached \u20ac13.6bn -

The England goalkeeper then made two excellent saves - to block Jacob Murphy's volley and then acrobatically tip over a powerful effort from Isak.\n\nBoth sides had chances in an open second half, with substitute James Garner hitting the post for Everton within six minutes of his introduction.\n\nNewcastle thought they", "PPL": 0.844403088092804, "PPL/lower": 0.7425304754045706, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002284022418427925, "Min-5%": 7.4177960461261225, "Min-10%": 5.6786241098946215, "Min-20%": 3.8267440950375025, "Min-30%": 2.7546997877499177, "Min-40%": 2.102446310131066, "Min-50%": 1.6875125279655554, "Min-60%": 1.4071083338000259}, {"text": "in which the prime minister pays a far lower tax rate than working people who face the highest tax burden in 70 years.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he hoped to be able to publish his tax returns on Thursday.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said Mr Sunak \"snuck\" the records out \"whilst the world is distracted with Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling\".\n\n\"People will be much more concerned today about the staggering tax hikes Rishi Sunak has imposed on them,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson Christine Jardine said.\n\nMr Sunak said he was glad to publish his tax return \"in the interests of transparency\".\n\nAsked on a visit to north Wales if, given his wealth, he could understand what it is like for people struggling to heat their homes, Mr Sunak said: \"Ultimately what people are interested in is what I'm going to do for them.\"\n\nPointing to government support with energy bills, he said tackling the cost of living was his \"number one priority\".\n\nWhile there is not a long tradition of prime ministers publishing their tax returns, some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have chosen to do so in recent years.\n\nFormer Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron published his tax return in 2016 after revelations about his late father's offshore fund were revealed in the Panama Papers.\n\nTheresa May released her tax return during her campaign to be Tory leader in 2016, but did not do so when she was prime minister.\n\nThe two previous prime ministers, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, did not publish their tax returns.\n\nThe financial affairs of Mr Sunak and his family were thrust into the media spotlight when he was chancellor in 2022.\n\nMr Sunak's wife, Ms Murty, revealed she had non-dom status, which meant she did not pay UK tax on her overseas earnings.\n\nMs Murty is the daughter the billionaire founder of Indian IT giant Infosys and owns a share of the company, entitling her to dividend payments.\n\nAs Mr Sunak came under political pressure, Ms Murty released a statement saying she would pay UK tax on her overseas income but retain her non-dom status.\n\nAt about the same time, Mr Sunak admitted he had held a US green card - allowing permanent residence in that country - while he was chancellor.\n\nHe returned the green card in October 2021, ahead of his first trip to the US as a UK government minister.\n\nFollowing these revelations, Mr Sunak referred himself to the prime minister's ethics adviser, who cleared him of breaching ministerial rules over the declaration of his financial arrangements.\n\nThe document released by the government includes an explanation of the prime minister's tax affairs from 2019.\n\nThe document says all of Mr Sunak's investment income and capital gains \"relate to a single US-based investment fund\", which is listed as a \"blind management arrangement\" on the register of ministers' interests.\n\nPoliticians with share portfolios and investments routinely set up blind trusts when they get government jobs. This allows them to continue earning income from their investments without knowing where the money is invested to avoid any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe document says \"some of the income of the US-based investment fund is also subject to tax in other jurisdictions (including the USA)\".\n\nMr Sunak is thought to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament\n\nMr Sunak - who has previously worked as an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs - has acknowledged that his investments are kept in a financial arrangement known as a blind trust.\n\nIn February, in an interview with TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan, he was asked whether it was right for prime ministers to have blind trusts.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"I think that's better than them having control over them.\"\n\nMr Sunak's records also show that the prime minister paid tax in the US on dividends in the country. A dividend is a sum of money paid by a company to its shareholders out of its profits.\n\n\"These US dividends were also subject to tax in the UK,\" the document says.\n\nThe document says Mr Sunak's previously held green card status did not impact his tax liability in either the UK or the US during the three financial years reported.\n\nShekhar Kapur says Hollywood's push to cast actors of colour comes from guilt\n\nDirector Shekhar Kapur has said Hollywood's push for more diverse casts has come from its guilt over \"all the actors who are not getting work\".\n\nKapur said the inclusion of ethnic minority actors in shows such as Netflix's Bridgerton is \"a good thing\" in terms of opportunity.\n\nBut, he said, it hides \"a greater, more fundamental issue\" of which stories are brought to the big screen.\n\nHe added the rise in protests had helped bring the issue to the fore.\n\n\"Hollywood should be telling stories of that culture, of the culture of the brown people, of the African-American people, of the black people, of Asians,\" he told BBC Newsnight's Sima Kotecha.\n\n\"But what's happening is they're still addicted to their, you know, the narrative is still their point of view.\"\n\nKapur is best known for his films Elizabeth and its sequel The Golden Age, both starring Cate Blanchett, and Bollywood films such as Mr India and Bandit Queen.\n\nWhen asked about Hollywood's efforts to increase the diversity of actors in its films, Kapur described it as \"a guilt trip\" and woke.\n\n\"It's Hollywood feeling guilty about all the actors that are not getting work. And because there's a huge rise of protests,\" he said.\n\nThe live-action remake of The Little Mermaid released in cinemas in May starred black actress and singer Halle Bailey as main character Ariel, which caused controversy in some quarters.\n\nHalle Bailey starred in Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid earlier this year\n\nKapur joined the film industry in India as an actor, before going on to become a director.\n\nHis 1998 film Elizabeth, about the early years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, received widespread critical acclaim and several Oscar nominations.\n\nFollowing its release, the director said many of the scripts he received went on to be \"a huge success\", including ones that he turned down.\n\nDiscussing international scripts he would receive, he said: \"It's always an American going in, fixing the world's problem, going to Africa... and I said, 'Don't send me those scripts because it's not true'.\n\nKapur was educated in Delhi before moving to London for a career as a management consultant and chartered accountant\n\n\"For example, if you were going to make Gandhi the answer, the question was: 'Who's the American in it?

A soldier can be trained to use them in less than a day.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMany analysts believe they had a major impact on the course of the conflict in the days following Russia's invasion.\n\n\"Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,\" says Mr Bronk.\n\nThe weapons have been \"particularly effective\" when used in combination with artillery, he says.\n\nMaritime Brimstone missiles were also sent to Ukraine in 2022.\n\nBrimstones can be used against tanks, artillery and some smaller vessels such as landing craft, according to Capt Chris Carlson, formerly of the US Navy.\n\nThe missiles are normally fired from aircraft, but in Ukraine they are being modified to be fired from trucks.\n\nLaunching them from the ground reduces their effective range, says Capt Carlson.\n\nWhen used as anti-ship missiles, Brimstones are far too small to sink larger vessels, but could cause substantial damage.\n\n\"It all depends where you hit,\" he says. \"If you went through an engine or near the water line, you could give an enemy some serious trouble.\"\n\nBritain has donated at least 120 armoured vehicles to Ukraine, including Mastiff patrol vehicles.\n\nMastiffs were very popular among British troops in Afghanistan as they provide a high level of protection against landmines and improvised explosive devices.\n\nAnalysts say that in an area which as been as heavily mined as the Donbas, Mastiffs are likely to be very useful.\n\nIt is understood that both sides in the conflict have used landmines extensively.\n\nBritain says it has donated at least six air defence systems, including Starstreak missiles.\n\nStarstreak is designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.\n\nIt ignores counter-measures such as flares and chaff deployed by many aircraft.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"From a pilot's point of view, Starstreak is a very unpleasant thing,\" says Mr Bronk. \"There's very little you can do about it.\"\n\nHe says Russian forces may deem some operations too risky if they are aware that a weapon as deadly as Starstreak is on the ground.\n\nThe UK has also supplied Stormer vehicles to act as a mobile platform for Starstreak missiles.\n\nOther equipment supplied by the UK includes:\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nAndy Murray dazzled under the Wimbledon lights again as he led Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a Centre Court thriller stopped by a 23:00 BST curfew.\n\nBritain's Murray is ranked 40th but showed his pedigree on the SW19 grass to lead 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-4.\n\nThe second-round match was stopped at 22:39 because of the restrictions put in place by the local council.\n\nMurray, who has regularly played late in recent years, and Tsitsipas will resume a captivating contest on Friday.\n\nMoments after 36-year-old Murray had wrapped up the third set, tournament referee Gerry Armstrong walked on to the court and discussed stopping play for the night with each player.\n\nMurray, who screamed out as he fell just before serving out for the lead, signalled to his team the match was being cut short, while 24-year-old Tsitsipas quickly packed his bags.\n\nThe pair will return to Centre Court after Spanish top seed Carlos Alcaraz plays France's Alexandre Muller in the first match, which starts at 13:30.\n\u2022 None Djokovic set for 'duel of the veterans of the tour'\n\nEyes were instantly drawn to this potential blockbuster when the draw was made last Friday and, after both players negotiated their opening matches on different paths, it was billed as the box-office match of the tournament so far.\n\nFurther fuel was added by the memories from their feisty clash at the 2021 US Open, where Murray said he \"lost respect\" for Tsitsipas after a lengthy bathroom break before a final set which the Greek won.\n\nThis time, all the drama remained on the court.\n\nMurray is a two-time champion at the All England Club and has", "PPL": 0.8521624803543091, "PPL/lower": 0.7479158462229316, "PPL/zlib": 0.00022975531958865168, "Min-5%": 6.142612976186416, "Min-10%": 4.816833215601304, "Min-20%": 3.4240140031777266, "Min-30%": 2.6002751432529103, "Min-40%": 2.060375908184751, "Min-50%": 1.686281816948311, "Min-60%": 1.4163281787702577}, {"text": "\"calmer night\".\n\nAround 45,000 police were deployed across the country for a second night on Saturday.\n\nMore than 1,300 arrests were made on Friday night and more than 900 on Thursday.\n\nOfficials hope that a turning-point may have been reached -

A video, shared online in the hours following Nahel's death, showed two police officers trying to stop the vehicle and one pointing his weapon at the driver.\n\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot has since been charged with voluntary homicide and apologised to the family. His lawyer said he was devastated.\n\nNahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop.\n\nMore widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force. The UN's human rights office said the unrest was a chance for France \"to address deep issues of racism in law enforcement\".\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence on Friday \"with the greatest firmness\" and said Nahel's death had been used to justify acts of violence - calling it an \"unacceptable exploitation of the adolescent's death\".\n\nThis is the worst leak of US intelligence for 10 years.\n\nNot since former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden and former US Army soldier Chelsea Manning published classified documents has so much supposedly secret intelligence leaked into the public domain.\n\nThe damage is on several levels. Russia now knows exactly what parts of its military intelligence are being eavesdropped on by the US. It will now move swiftly to plug those gaps.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear from the documents that Washington hasn\u2019t just been spying on its enemies, it\u2019s been spying on its friends too \u2013 like Ukraine, Israel and South Korea.\n\nThe scene yesterday near the front line in Bakhmut, Ukraine Image caption: The scene yesterday near the front line in Bakhmut, Ukraine\n\nIt appears that the US has been distributing highly sensitive intelligence to far too wide a circle of people.\n\nThat will make some countries think twice before they can trust America with sensitive information.\n\nBut, by far the most serious damage has been done to Ukraine.\n\nThe leaked documents reveal what weapons Ukraine still has. And the conclusion is that it\u2019s fast running out of air defence missiles.\n\nThat tells the Kremlin that if Ukraine can\u2019t resupply itself then it will be safe to unleash the Russian air force.\n\nThis could potentially change the entire course of the war in Moscow\u2019s favour.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that the complainants in this case have a legal right to lifelong anonymity.\n\nThat's because they are alleged victims of a sexual offence, which means by law their names cannot be published.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the information we tell you does not lead to jigsaw identification.\n\nThat's when bits of information when pieced together can lead to someone being identified.\n\nIt means there may be some details we need to leave out from our reporting because of this.\n\nQuinten carries EpiPens in case he goes into anaphylactic shock\n\nParents of a six-year-old with food allergies have said they faced an \"uphill battle\" to get a good selection of school meals for him.\n\nQuinten from Powys has a severe allergy to dairy, egg, soya and nuts.\n\nHis dad Kam said he \"always feels like the odd one out\" with his friends as he and wife Ceri try to make progress with Powys council to avoid him having bland or repetitive meals.\n\nThe council said its menus were healthy and balanced.\n\nQuinten is in Year 1 and is entitled to free school meals but his parents said they still faced a challenge to make sure he was happy at lunchtime.\n\nKam said: \"I find it really perplexing because Welsh government have announced that this was a priority... yet they seem to be totally unprepared for this, which I don't quite understand.\n\n\"From the very beginning when we knew he was entitled to a meal, it started off at a very basic level in terms of what they came back with.\n\n\"Lots of roast dinners, jacket potatoes without butter or cheese or anything, bland type options and we've had to spend a lot of time working with them to say 'well no, that's not right'.\"\n\nParents Kam and Ceri say they just want Quinten to have the same choices as his friends\n\nOne lunchtime, Quinten had \"a slice of turkey in some gravy\" when his friends had curry.\n\nQuinten's mother Ceri said she and Kam had been told that a \"single supplier policy\" meant the council could not find similar alternatives which would be safe.\n\n\"Their policy is the bit that discriminates against him...

Watch: Drone footage posted by Ukrainian official shows Lviv debris after Russian strike\n\nAt least nine people have been killed and power at Europe's largest nuclear plant has been lost after Russia launched missiles across Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks hit cities from Kharkiv in the north to Odesa in the south and Zhytomyr in the west.\n\nBuildings and infrastructure were hit in Kharkiv and Odesa, with power blackouts in several areas. Attacks on the capital Kyiv are also reported.\n\nUkraine said Russia fired 81 missiles, in what is the biggest strike in weeks.\n\nThe military claimed it successfully shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the eight Iranian-made Shahed drones which were fired.\n\nThe attacks mark the biggest day of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine since the end of January, when 11 people died after dozens of buildings were struck in several regions.\n\nIn Thursday's attacks, at least five people were killed in Lviv in western Ukraine, after a rocket hit their home, the region's governor Maksym Kozytskyi said on Telegram.\n\nRussian shelling killed three people in the southern city of Kherson, where a public transport stop was hit, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said.\n\nWhile one person died and two others were injured following drone and missile strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to governor Serhii Lysak.\n\nNuclear energy operator Energoatom said a strike at the Zaporizhzhia plant meant the \"last link\" between the facility and the Ukrainian power system was cut off.\n\nFor the sixth time since it was taken over by Russia a year ago, the facility is now operating on diesel generators, which have enough supplies to last at least 10 days.\n\nThe director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for a commitment to protecting the safety of the plant, saying he was \"astonished by the complacency\" surrounding the successive strikes since the invasion began.\n\n\"Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out,\" Rafael Grossi said.\n\nRussia-installed officials in the Moscow-controlled part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said the halt in electricity supplies to the power station from Ukrainian-held territory was \"a provocation\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was \"a difficult night\", after Russia resumed its \"wretched tactics\".\n\nHe said energy systems were being restored and all services were working after the \"massive\" rocket attack struck critical infrastructure and residential buildings.\n\nIn Kyiv, emergency services are at the scenes of blasts in western and southern districts of the capital where the mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said explosions had taken place.\n\nMr Klitschko said cars were burning in the courtyard of one residential building and he urged people to stay in shelters. Much of the city has been left without electricity, with four in 10 people without power, he added.\n\nPeople gathered outside a residential building in Kyiv following the strikes\n\nA mass missile attack struck an energy facility in the port city of Odesa, triggering power cuts, its governor Maksym Marchenko said. Residential areas were also hit but no casualties were reported, he added.\n\n\"About 15\" strikes hit Kharkiv city and region, with \"critical infrastructure facilities\" and a residential building targeted, regional administration chief Oleg Synegubov said.\n\nOther regions hit include Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west, and Dnipro and Poltava in the centre of the country.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion just over a year ago. Since then tens of thousands of combatants and civilians have been killed or injured and millions of Ukrainians became refugees.\n\nThe US Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, suggested on Wednesday that President Putin might be planning to drag out the war for years but that Russia was not strong enough to launch major new offensives this year.\n\nShe said the war in Ukraine had become a \"grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage\".\n\n\"We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and that prolonging the war including with potential pauses in the fighting may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,\" she said.\n\nEmergency workers attended burning cars damaged by the Russian missile strikes in Kyiv\n\nMs Haines said Russia might turn to defending the territories it now occupies, adding that it would need additional \"mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources\" to sustain even its level of operations in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's military says it has pushed back intense Russian attacks on the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut despite Russian forces claiming to have taken control of its eastern half.\n\nMoscow has been trying to take Bakhmut for months, as both sides suffer heavy losses in a grinding war of attrition.\n\n\"The enemy continued its attacks and has shown no sign of a let-up in storming the city of Bakhmut,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said. \"Our defenders repelled attacks on Bakhmut and on surrounding communities.\"\n\nBetween 20,000 and 30,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut since it began last summer, Western officials say. The figures cannot be verified independently.\n\nPaul Heaton also paid for drinks at 60 pubs to mark his 60th birthday last year\n\nPop star Paul Heaton said he is putting money behind the bar of four pubs in Warrington so fans attending a festival can \"have a drink on him\".\n\nThe ex-Housemartins and Beautiful South singer is playing the Neighbourhood Festival in Victoria Park this weekend.\n\nHe also paid for drinks at 60 pubs to mark his 60th birthday last year.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Heaton said the gesture was a \"thank you and a small amount of help\" during the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe pubs involved will be the The Bull's Head on Church Street, The Kings Head on Winwick Street and The Cheshire Cheese on Knutsford Road, which are all within a couple of miles of the festival site.\n\nThe Facebook post said: \"Money will also be left behind the bar of the festival's own pub, the Neighbourhood Inn for anyone heading into the festival early looking to catch any of the artists kicking off the different stages each day.\n\n\"A similar process will be running local to the other Paul Heaton shows over this summer.\"\n\nHeaton shot to fame with the Hull-based Housemartins in the early 80s.\n\nThey had two successful albums and a number of hit singles, including a cover version of Caravan of Love which reached Number One in the UK charts in December 1986.\n\nAfter the band split he formed the Beautiful South in 1988, which became one of the biggest-selling UK acts of all time, releasing 15 albums over nine years.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

although they were lower than in the same period in 2022.\n\nIn February, Shell reported profits of $39.9bn for 2022, double the previous year's total and the highest in its 115-year history.\n\nWhile the jump in oil and gas prices following the start of the war in Ukraine led to big profits for energy companies, it also fuelled a rise in energy bills for households and businesses.\n\nLast year, the UK government introduced a windfall tax on profits made from extracting UK oil and gas - called the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) - to help fund its scheme to lower gas and electricity bills.\n\nUnder the government's Energy Price Guarantee, energy bills for a typical household have been limited to \u00a32,500 a year, although this level of support is due to stop at the end of June.\n\nHowever, the fall in oil and gas prices on the international markets has raised hopes that bills will fall below this level in July, making the price guarantee redundant.\n\nOil prices have dropped to around $80 a barrel from highs of nearly $128 following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEight BBC local radio presenters are to share a broadcasting award for interviews with former Prime Minister Liz Truss last year.\n\nThe hosts grilled the then prime minister days after her mini-budget sparked turmoil in the economy.\n\nThe Broadcasting Press Guild said their interviews were \"were game-changing for Liz Truss and her doomed government\" and will award them its jury prize.\n\nIt comes as BBC local radio stations in England face cuts to their programmes.\n\nMs Truss faced tough questioning during the round of local radio interviews in September.\n\nThe eight interviewers are:\n\nGrant Tucker", "PPL": 0.520277202129364, "PPL/lower": 0.6311152554968241, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014195830890296427, "Min-5%": 5.486736159698636, "Min-10%": 3.9499004296227995, "Min-20%": 2.443003476540442, "Min-30%": 1.706209757562472, "Min-40%": 1.2959773468131468, "Min-50%": 1.0398379598160659, "Min-60%": 0.8670245739796308}, {"text": "gun salutes will be sounded from firing stations in 13 locations including Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast at the moment the King is crowned.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was incredibly proud of our military personnel who were \"preparing to honour centuries of military tradition\".\n\n\"As they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Commonwealth friends and allies, I know the hard work of thousands of our servicemen and women during the past weeks and months will culminate in an incredible display that will amaze crowds at home and across the world.\"\n\nBrit and Emmy-nominated composer Sarah Class has also been announced as the latest composer selected by the King to write music for the event.\n\nMs Class, who composed musical scores for Sir David Attenborough's natural world programmes and National Geographic documentaries, said she was \"very honoured and privileged and excited\" to have been chosen.\n\nShe joins eleven other musicians selected by the King, as well as Andrew Lloyd Webber, who will compose the coronation anthem.\n\nThe King has opted for a shorter, smaller and more diverse ceremony than the previous coronation held for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMore than 29,000 personnel took part in the 1953 coronation, including 16,100 members of the army.\n\nThe King, who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy for a total of five years.\n\nMystery surrounds the health of top Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov (pictured in 2020) Image caption: Mystery surrounds the health of top Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov (pictured in 2020)\n\nAnd it's with that quick recap of some of today's key events that we'll close this live coverage.\n\nThe day started with news of an attack on Odesa, before our focus returned to Ukraine's ongoing counter-offensive.

Until next time.\n\nArtificial-intelligence experts generally follow one of two schools of thought - it will either improve our lives enormously or destroy us all. And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\".\n\nThis week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.\n\nFormer UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders.\n\n\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country\n\nBut there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:\n\n\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.\n\nThere are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:\n\nBut what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?\n\nThe European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product.\n\nCompanies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nBut can developers predict or control how their product might be used?\n\nSo far, AI has been largely self-policed.\n\nThe big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nBut will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?\n\nYou can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.\n\nAnd Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations.\n\n\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\".\n\nIt can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".\n\nChatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.\n\nAnd in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.\n\nBut others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.\n\nChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.\n\nNow, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams.\n\nThe capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.\n\nAnd two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 - \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says.\n\nShe is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.\n\nThe rain warning is in place until 10:00 GMT on Thursday\n\nDisruptive rain is forecast for Northern Ireland from this afternoon with a weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nTravel disruption is expected as the rain becomes more persistent later on Wednesday.\n\nIt is due to last until later on Thursday morning, with between 20mm to 30mm of rain expected quite widely.\n\nSome areas could see up to 40mm of rainfall accumulating during that period.\n\nThat is likely to lead to surface spray and flooding on roads before conditions improve from the west on Thursday.\n\nThe warning is in place from 14:00 GMT on Wednesday until 10:00 GMT on Thursday.\n\nIt comes after heavy snowfall last week caused major delays and disruptions across the country.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

He later discovered it was being used on Instagram by someone advertising a service for \"theory/practical certificate without exams\".\n\nMr Jones says in the past year he has had to dispute hundreds of French speeding and parking tickets he has received because his licence details are being used fraudulently abroad.\n\nHe said: \"It makes you paranoid, it gives you a horrible feeling, it's like being burgled - you feel violated.\"\n\nThe DVSA's head of law enforcement said it had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licenses in 2022\n\nThe Driving Standards Agency, (DVSA), which promotes road safety and sets standards for training, warns many online adverts promising full licences quickly are money-making scams which may only provide a fake licence. It adds only the Driving and Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) can issue a genuine driving licence.\n\nThe number of people being prosecuted for test fraud via impersonations are increasing, the DVSA says. If convicted, they face prison sentences and fines. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight months for taking approximately 150 theory and practical tests for other drivers.\n\nThe DVSA warns if people do not meet the necessary driving standards before taking control of a vehicle, it could cause serious injuries or even fatalities.\n\nIts head of law enforcement, Marian Kitson, said its investigation team was catching more people committing fraud and had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licences in 2022.\n\nIn the year from April 2022, it sent 30 cases - involving 497 offences - of fraud by false representation for prosecution and there were 53 arrests.\n\nHowever, Ms Kitson said it was clear from their investigations that there was even more occurring, adding that they did not know the true scale of the problem.\n\n\"The internet is so huge; the social media platforms are vast and these people are very clever, they move the adverts around; they change them frequently,\" she said.\n\n\"So actually, spotting them and taking action quickly is a real challenge.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

Sir Keir says people's circumstances should not hold them back and \"you don't have to change who you are, just to get on\".\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to improve children's speaking skills, as part of a drive to break down class barriers to opportunity.\n\nHe also promised to give vocational and academic learning equal status, in a speech on education policy.\n\nTouching on his own background, he said people from working class backgrounds were now less able to advance in life.\n\nBut his speech was interrupted by protesters, unveiling a banner saying: \"No more u-turns, Green new deal.\"\n\nThe two young people who were protesting were standing right behind Sir Keir on the podium. Later, climate group Green New Deal Rising claimed responsibility for the disruption.\n\nThe Labour leader's speech unveiled details of the fifth and final \"mission\" the party is focused on ahead of the general election, expected next year.\n\nThe missions are expected to form the backbone of the party's election offer to voters, and shape its priorities in government if it wins power.\n\nIn his speech, Sir Keir promised a goal of half a million more children reaching early learning targets by 2030, as well as a review of the curriculum from the beginning of primary school through to the end of compulsory education.\n\nHe said a Labour government would \"tear down\" obstacles to opportunity, which he dubbed the \"class ceiling\".\n\n\"There's something more pernicious here, a pervasive idea, a barrier in our collective mind that narrows our ambitions for working class children and says - sometimes with subtlety, sometimes to your face - this isn't for you,\" he said.\n\nHe said the previous Labour government didn't \"eradicate the snobbery that looks down on vocational education, didn't drain the well of disrespect that this creates, and that cost us.\"\n\nHe said more children should study sport or a creative arts subject until they are 16, as well as a focus on digital skills.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

What a disgusting pair of Twits!\"\n\nThat sparked criticism for a \"negative representation\" of disability.\n\nJames and Smith, who write the popular Kid Normal books, have co-authored The Twits Next Door - part of a new series commissioned by the Roald Dahl Story Company.\n\nIn the video, the pair came up with ways to make the characters look \"really gross\" and \"horrible\".\n\nJames posted on X that it was \"absolutely not our intention\" to cause offence \"and we apologise unreservedly\".\n\nA host of modern authors will put a new spin on Roald Dahl's books\n\nHe wrote: \"We understand that words matter and we pride ourselves on championing and welcoming everyone into the magical world of children's books. We would never dream of deliberately setting out to exclude anyone.\"\n\nJames added that with the glass eye comment, \"we were attempting to pay homage to one of the Twit's most famous pranks involving a glass of beer in order to remind people of Dahl's infamous terrible two\".\n\nHe said it does not form part of the plot of the new story, \"nor was it our intention to suggest that it was in any way disgusting\".\n\n\"It's unfortunate that the word disgusting appears to be a direct comment on that.

I'd hoped the world had moved on.\"\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement earlier on Friday that James and Smith were among a number of current authors who are writing new stories based on classic Dahl books.\n\nTheir novel will see a new family called the Lovelies move in next door to The Twits, prompting the Twits to hatch a plan to rid themselves of their horribly nice new neighbours. The Twits Next Door will be published in August.\n\nElsewhere, TV presenter Konnie Huq, The Last Leg comedian Adam Hills and author Adam Kay will contribute to a short story collection, Charlie and the Christmas Factory.\n\nThe move follows Netflix's purchase of the rights to Dahl's children's books in 2021. The streaming giant now owns the Roald Dahl Story Company, giving it ultimate control of what happens to Dahl's stories in publishing, as well as TV and film.\n\nIt was tense, uncomfortable, and not just because the room was swelteringly warm.\n\nThe committee\u2019s grilling didn\u2019t last the full five hours some anticipated, but it was still extensive - and long.\n\nSo how did Johnson do? Well, we won\u2019t know just yet whether or not his evidence was enough to convince MPs that when - as he\u2019s admitted - he misled Parliament, he did not do so intentionally or recklessly, and corrected the record at the earliest opportunity.\n\nJohnson seemed at his most confident when he was able to draw on facts that suggest rule breaking wouldn\u2019t have been obvious to him - like that official photographers were present at times and that his birthday gathering was briefed to the Times newspaper. He looked more at ease here.\n\nIt got trickier for him when he started having his own social distancing guidance cited back at him.\n\nThe photographic evidence here became difficult for him as he was forced to explain how drinks gatherings demonstrated social distancing being followed \u201cwherever possible.\u201d\n\nHere he relied mostly on his belief these gatherings were \u201cessential\u201d for work. Will that wash with the committee? We\u2019ll need to wait and see.\n\nHe was most visibly rattled - as were some of the supportive Tory MPs sat behind him - when they grilled him on whether he had adequate assurances that rules were followed, as he claimed to Parliament.\n\nMany watching at home may have made up their minds already about whether or not they back his defence.\n\nBut it could be a while still before we know how all this has landed with the people who really matter now - the MPs who have his fate in their hands.\n\nApple has unveiled a much-anticipated augmented reality headset, Apple Vision Pro, in its first major hardware launch for almost a decade.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook said the new headset \"seamlessly blends the real world and the virtual world\".\n\nThe tech firm also announced its latest iPhone operating system, as well as updates to MacBook Air.\n\nThe headset has a two-hour battery life, costs $3,499 (\u00a32,849) and will be released early next year in the US.\n\nThe cost is considerably higher than virtual reality headsets currently on the market. Last week Meta announced its Quest 3 - which costs $499.\n\nApple said little about generative artificial intelligence - the buzzy technology that is the talk of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe company's share price fell slightly during the announcement, made at a developer's conference at Apple Park, the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California.\n\nThe BBC was among the media outlets at the event, and technology editor Zoe Kleinman was one of the first people in the world to try out the headset.\n\n\"Since current boss Tim Cook took over in 2011, with the possible exception of the Watch, Apple has been unable to come up with the kind of world-changing product of the past,\" she said.\n\n\"Have they done it here?\"\n\nApple Vision Pro looks different to similar headsets on the market - and is more reminiscent of a pair of ski goggles than a virtual reality headset.\n\nApple used the phrase \"augmented reality\" to describe what the new device does.\n\nAugmented reality, also known as mixed reality, superimposes virtual objects in the world around us - enabling us to mix reality with virtual reality by looking through a screen.\n\n\"It's like your phone but right in front of you - big, bright and bold, wherever you are,\" Ms Kleinman said.\n\nIn letting you do things", "PPL": 1.5106587409973145, "PPL/lower": 0.9106505228668977, "PPL/zlib": 0.000382929972369408, "Min-5%": 8.519380934098187, "Min-10%": 7.109759188165851, "Min-20%": 5.525564444968636, "Min-30%": 4.423387227306925, "Min-40%": 3.607099749785472, "Min-50%": 2.9848226944488983, "Min-60%": 2.5120583319678564}, {"text": "the assassination of a senior Iranian general in Damascus, widely assumed in Israel to be the work of its air force. It was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the Hamas attacks six months ago. It was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences.\n\nSome of them may happen close to where I'm writing this, looking across the Sea of Galilee towards the Golan Heights, the large swathe of southern Syria that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. As the crow flies, Damascus is less than 50 miles from here. The border with Lebanon is close by. At night, especially, there is constant Israeli air activity, with the roar of jets on patrol, or heading off to bomb Lebanon or Syria.\n\nA shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in Gaza since last October. It started with Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political movement attacking Israel, in support of Hamas in Gaza. It was not the onslaught that the Hamas leadership was hoping for - neither Hezbollah or its patrons in Tehran wanted an all-out war with Israel and, indirectly, its American backers. The Americans did not want that either and restrained Israel's instinct to respond in full force.\n\nBut Hezbollah still tied down thousands of Israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas. Israel's response, limited compared to earlier border wars, forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the Lebanese side.\n\nSince the start of this year it has been different. Israel has been setting the pace, bombing its enemies deeper inside Lebanon and Syria. The biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on Monday with the assassination by air strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital.\n\nIran accuses Israel of carrying out the deadly air strike on its consular building in Damascus\n\nIn interviews here in northern Israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah and force them back from the border.\n\nThey were not put off by Israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th Century, when it occupied a broad strip of South Lebanon to try to protect northern Israel. It even created its own Lebanese militia to help with the fighting. The Israelis pulled out in 2000, under constant military harassment from Hezbollah, after prime minister Ehud Barak, a former head of the army, decided that occupying south Lebanon (Israel called it the \"security zone\") did not make Israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops.\n\nI walked through the ruins of the Avivim winery, which is right on the border wire. It was destroyed in a Hezbollah strike last week. Its owner Shlomi Biton showed me through the wreck of his business. He is 47 and was born in Avivim, which like the rest of northern Israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations. Shlomi fought in Lebanon during his military service, and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for Israel to return to Lebanon for a decisive battle with Hezbollah.\n\n\"There's no other choice,\" he told me next his burnt-out business. \"Otherwise, the community won't return to live here, maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back.\"\n\nIn Kiryat Shmona, a border town where 25,000 Israelis lived, no more than 3,000 people, mostly soldiers and essential workers, are left. The Mayor, Avichai Stern, showed me deserted districts and wrecked buildings. He believes that Israel can remove Hezbollah's threat to the north with a decisive and destructive invasion on the lines of the Gaza war.\n\nThe Mayor of Kyriat Shmona, Avichai Stern shows fragment of shrapnel from a Hezbollah strike on residential buildings in the town\n\nMayor Stern said last year 10,000 Hezbollah fighters practised taking over northern Israel.\n\n\"It can happen here\" he told me, \"just like Gaza. They weren't training to direct traffic in Beirut. The only way to stop it is to go into Lebanon eliminate this threat as soon as possible.\"\n\nExactly six months ago, in deadly secrecy, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to the battle plan it called Operation al-Aqsa flood. The killing on 7 October and everything that has followed destroyed lazy, wishful thinking that it was possible to manage the century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHamas thrust the conflict back to the top of the world's agenda when it killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took more than 250 Israelis and foreign citizens into Gaza as hostages. Many of the 134 Israelis still there are thought to be dead. It was Israel's worst single day since it won its independence war in 1948.\n\nThe \"mighty vengeance\" that Mr Netanyahu promised has so far killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, a majority of whom were civilians. Israel's American-supplied firepower has flattened most of Gaza. The war has spread across the Middle East. It might now be entering a new phase.\n\nThe borderlands between Israel and Lebanon are deceptively beautiful in the first few weeks of spring. Wild flowers and pinecones, not shrapnel, were underfoot as I walked along a stretch of the border with Israeli military officers. Any sense of peace was, of course, an illusion on one of the most dangerous borders in the Middle East. Iran and Hezbollah are making decisions about how to respond to the assassinations in the Damascus and the way Israel is increasing the military pressure in Lebanon. The two allies will want to calibrate their response to avoid a wider, devastating war that neither want.\n\nIsrael does not want that war either. But the audacious assassination at the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus could be a sign that Israel believes Iran and the network it calls its axis of resistance might blink first. If so, it is a risky strategy. Iran will want to restore its ability to deter Israel, which is clearly not working. It will try to respond in a way that will catch Israel by surprise.\n\nThe empty overgrown border communities are not likely to be Iran's first choice for retaliation. They could try an Israeli target in another country, or cyber-attacks rather than missiles. Or intensify their nuclear programme.\n\nAn American envoy, Amos Hochstein, is trying to find a way to revive the UN Security Council resolution that ended the last big war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. Neither side has respected it, but it provides a framework for negotiation.\n\nAt this crossroads, neither Israel, Iran nor Hezbollah wants an all-out war that would have terrible consequence for all of them. But no side seems ready to stop the slide towards it.\n\nDon't trust anyone who tells you they know the political implications of this indictment.\n\nI certainly don't, and nor do they. We don't know the charges, we don't know the evidence and we don't know how the trial will unfold.\n\nSince the indictment was announced, I've heard from people close to the former president who've told me this is bad news for Democrats because this is a weak case, the weakest of all the potential cases against Trump.\n\nI've also heard from Democrats who say the spectacle of Trump on trial is bound to weaken him as he runs for the White House, and the reminder of his alleged affair with a former porn star will turn off evangelical Christians who once supported him.\n\nTwo things can be true at once.\n\nThe political question will be in the raw numbers: does it win him more voters or lose him voters?\n\nThe more important question for America is whether this trial, whenever it occurs, can be removed from the political realm and be seen as a fair legal process.\n\nYou can catch Katty on Americast here\n\nLast updated on .From the section Women's Football\n\nDomestic women's football could become a \"billion pound industry\" in 10 years' time says former Lionesses midfielder Karen Carney - the chair of a major review into the sport.\n\nHer 126-page report recommends the top two tiers of women's football in England being", "PPL": 0.4331258237361908, "PPL/lower": 0.7176496503867369, "PPL/zlib": 0.00011677698132547609, "Min-5%": 4.5261651254167745, "Min-10%": 3.201329605836494, "Min-20%": 1.9831072763883688, "Min-30%": 1.4003253317762663, "Min-40%": 1.072101252882179, "Min-50%": 0.8634946433698006, "Min-60%": 0.7212304431051684}, {"text": "health minister of a lack of duty of care, saying some of the other members were \"suffering from stress and upset\" but there had been \"nothing from Eluned Morgan's team to indicate any awareness of that or any concern for us after the event\".\n\n\"Somebody needs to take responsibility and I can only see two people in the frame potentially - Mark Drakeford and Eluned Morgan,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for BCUHB said: \"The management of the issues raised in the EY report is progressing in line with existing procedures and policies.\n\n\"This follows the conclusion of the NHS Counter Fraud Wales investigation connected to the Auditor General's qualified opinion of the Health Board's 2021-22 financial accounts.\n\n\"It is inappropriate to comment on the status of any employees at this stage.\n\n\"We currently have six independent board members in place, alongside two associate independent members.

How much more are we going to be able to tolerate all this?\" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra.\n\n\"I only found out about the rise through an email.\n\nDeirdre McCausland, a single mother from west Belfast, said she was in shock at the increase in bills\n\n\"It is the worst timing ever.

customers will see their average bills rise by about \u00a3127 a year.\n\nClick Energy is reducing its standard tariff by 10.36% and other tariffs also also being cut to offset the reduction of government support - customers will see no change in their typical yearly bills.\n\nIt is the smallest of the five Northern Irish electricity suppliers, with about 24,000 customers.\n\nSSE Airtricity provides gas to about 195,000 customers in the Greater Belfast area\n\nSSE Airtricity announced a decrease of 12.2% effective from July but customers will actually see their gas bills increase by about \u00a3134 a year because of the loss of government support.\n\nThat means a typical customer's annual bill will rise from \u00a31,266 in June to \u00a31,399 in July.\n\nSSE Airtricity serves about 195,000 customers in the Greater Belfast area and 3,200 customers in the Gas to the West area.\n\nBills for Firmus Energy customers will increase by about \u00a3328 in both the Ten Towns gas network and the Greater Belfast gas network areas.\n\nFor those in the Ten Towns gas network area, a typical annual bill will rise from \u00a31,147 in June to \u00a31,475 in July.\n\nA typical bill for customers in the Greater Belfast area will rise from \u00a31,190 in June to \u00a31,518 in July.\n\nFrom January to March this year energy bills in Northern Ireland were being discounted by up to 13.6p a unit for electricity and 3.9p a unit for gas.\n\nThat support was reduced from April to June 2023 -

or 62 days - to the pre-pandemic level of 14,000 by the end of March 2023.\n\n\"We've made very significant progress, the backlog was at an all-time high of around 34,000 last summer,\" Dame Cally told the Health and Social Care Committee.\n\n\"Last week it was 23,500, so we've dropped by about 10,000 but there's still further to go.\"\n\nMost of the patients on that waiting list will ultimately be told they do not have cancer but, giving evidence to the committee, NHS officials said that long waits for a diagnosis create \"a lot of anxiety for people\".\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, told MPs: \"I don't think anybody is comfortable with the fact that we have a large number of people who are waiting too long to get their diagnosis and start their treatment.\n\n\"What we need to do is contend with a very large number of referrals - between 200,000 to 260,000 people every month are referred for investigation of possible cancer, [of] whom only about 6% will have cancer.\"\n\nDame Deborah James raised millions for cancer research before she died aged 40\n\nDame Cally said the spike in referrals from GPs has been linked to a number of factors including a rise in cancer rates in the population; more people putting off care during the pandemic who are now coming forward; and a wider increase in awareness attributed", "PPL": 0.5718178153038025, "PPL/lower": 0.7181881780379976, "PPL/zlib": 0.00017003205926369386, "Min-5%": 5.244820192748425, "Min-10%": 3.886900478133968, "Min-20%": 2.5434037435317096, "Min-30%": 1.8367867882117774, "Min-40%": 1.414066216746723, "Min-50%": 1.1402034663421377, "Min-60%": 0.9521924440247683}, {"text": "in your browser. Watch: Susan Sarandon on the dangers of AI in film industry\n\nFor actors, pay for individual roles has declined, forcing them to seek several more roles to make the same amount of money as they did a few years ago.\n\nWriting contracts have become shorter and more perilous, with payment often not included for writers' work on revisions or new material.\n\n\"We are being victimised by a very greedy entity,\" Fran Drescher, the current SAG president, said on Thursday. \"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us.\"\n\nThe failed negotiations between the unions and the AMPTP marks the first tandem strike in the industry since 1960. The last actors' strike, in 1980, lasted 10 weeks.\n\nA third union, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), is not participating in the strike after successfully negotiating its own contract in June, but the group has said it \"strongly supports\" those who are picketing.\n\nWith the prospect that the strike could roll on for months, cinemas could face problems, and viewers may be left with nothing new to watch bar reality TV and live sport.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the White House said President Joe Biden \"believes all workers - including actors - deserve fair pay and benefits\".\n\n\"The President supports workers' right to strike and hopes the parties can reach a mutually beneficial agreement,\" spokeswoman Robyn Patterson said.\n\nActors represented by SAG's sister union in the UK - Equity - must continue to work as normal, due to UK employment laws. That includes stars of HBO's House of the Dragon.\n\nThe union has however told US companies it will be keeping a \"very close eye\" on any attempts to move US productions to the UK.\n\nGrimes' music often lives on the threshold between humanity and machines\n\nGrimes has invited musicians to clone her voice using Artificial Intelligence in order to create new songs.\n\nThe pop singer, whose real name is Claire Boucher, said she would \"split 50% royalties on any successful AI-generated song that uses my voice\".\n\n\"Same deal as I would with any artist I collab[orate] with. Feel free to use my voice without penalty,\" she tweeted.\n\nHer declaration comes as the music industry scrambles to react to a spate of AI songs trained on artist's voices\n\nLast week, Universal Music successfully petitioned streaming services to remove a song called Heart On My Sleeve, which used deep-faked vocals from their artists Drake and The Weeknd.\n\nIn a statement, the label said \"the training of generative AI using our artists' music\" was \"a violation of copyright law\". However, that position has not been tested in court, and remains a legal grey area.\n\nA report by The Verge discovered that Universal managed to get the track pulled from YouTube because it contained an unlicensed sample of the producer Metro Boomin' saying his name, which was protected by copyright, rather than any claims over the song itself, which appears to be an original composition.\n\nFor context: Copyright law is very much based on the idea of making a copy - whether it's of a melody or a lyric, by the use of a sample, or making a derivative work like a remix. Heart On My Sleeve did not, it seems, directly lift elements from Drake's previous songs.\n\nDrake and The Weeknd are not thought to have been involved in the creation of Heart On My Sleeve - although some critics have suggested the song was released by Drake as a stunt\n\nFurther to this, the US Copyright Office recently ruled that AI art, including music, can't be copyrighted as it is \"not the product of human authorship\".\n\nIt is still unclear whether art that is created by a human, but which contains AI elements, can be copyrighted.\n\nOn Twitter, Grimes said she was energised by the \"idea of open sourcing all art and killing copyright\".\n\nThe musician said she was already working on a programme \"that should simulate my voice well\", but would also consider releasing a capella tracks for people to train their own software on..\n\nAfter her announcement, fans immediately posted links to songs they had created featuring her vocals.\n\nThe Canadian artist said she was looking forward to being a \"guinea pig\" for the technology, adding: \"I think it's cool to be fused w[ith] a machine\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Unite has accused the airport of a real-terms wage cut.\n\nHeathrow said it had offered a 10% pay increase back-dated to 1 January, plus a lump sum payment of more than \u00a31,000.\n\nThe airport said contingency plans were keeping the airport operating as usual.\n\nHowever, British Airways cancelled about 70 flights on Friday. This included flights already removed from the schedule due to the strikes, and cancellations for other reasons, such as bad weather and an air traffic control strike in France.\n\nPicket lines were mounted outside the airport and Unite said the strike was being \"well supported\".\n\nHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the BBC \"many\" security staff had chosen to work on Friday, but \"a lot\" of agency security staff had been brought in, alongside \"hundreds\" of managers who were \"here to help\".\n\n\"The airport is operating as normal,\" he said.\n\nAre you a security officer striking at Heathrow, or a passenger concerned about your travel plans being disrupted? Share your experiences.\n\nThe next few days are expected to be busy as people get away on Easter holidays.\n\nAhead of the strike, Heathrow asked airlines to stop selling tickets and allow customers to change travel dates.\n\nBritish Airways pre-emptively cancelled 300 flights and Virgin Atlantic confirmed it had limited new ticket sales and introduced a flexible policy.\n\nThe strike reduces the number of security staff available to the airport on what is normally a very busy weekend.\n\nHeathrow said it was deploying 1,000 extra colleagues and its management team to assist passengers.\n\nTravellers should check their flight before travelling to the airport, arriving at Heathrow no earlier than two hours before short-haul flights and three hours before long-haul flights, and be ready for security, the airport said.\n\nPassengers will only be permitted to go through security with two items of hand luggage to help the flow.\n\nThe aviation industry more broadly is under pressure from the government and the industry regulator to avoid a repeat of last year's Easter's queues, delays and cancellations, which were largely caused by staff shortages.\n\nA leaked letter to businesses from the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport, seen by the BBC, says it would be unacceptable for consumers to face the same level of disruption this year.\n\nAirlines and airports have told the BBC they are confident of having enough staff in place this time round, although external factors such as strikes in France affecting air traffic control could cause issues.\n\nThe Empire Pool and trolley buses - two sights no longer seen in Cardiff\n\nSome of the last traces of arguably the biggest event ever to be hosted in Wales are set to disappear.\n\nWith 1,130 athletes from 35 countries descending on Cardiff, experts believe the country may never see the like of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games again.\n\nLittle remains of the venues used, with the Sophia Gardens Pavilion demolished in 1982 and the Empire Pool in 1998.\n\nThe velodrome at Maindy could soon be bulldozed too under plans.\n\nIt is the last remnant of an event sports author Huw Richards believes trumps the 1999 Rugby World Cup as the biggest hosted here.\n\n\"As soon as you set foot in the Arms Park, and saw the gathering of elite athletes from all over the globe, you could feel a sense that Wales had become a grown-up member of the world community,\" is how cultural historian Prof Peter Stead described the games.\n\nFor younger generations, Maindy Velodrome is best known for nurturing some of Wales' greatest cycling talents, including 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas.\n\nBut it is also where riders battled it out for gold in 1958.\n\nUnder proposals, an expansion of Cathays High School would see the velodrome lost, and a new track built at Cardiff Bay.\n\nBritish cyclist Ray Booty waves as he gets the chequered flag to win the 120 miles road race - which started and finished in St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan\n\nThe club that uses it, Maindy Flyers, said the prospect of \"being left with nothing for future generations of cyclists\" was \"unacceptable\".\n\nCardiff council replied by saying it fully understands the site's \"historic nature\", but the new velodrome had the support of the national governing body for cycling.\n\nCardiff Central station remains - but the frontage looked a bit different in 1958\n\nSimilar pain was felt by the swimming community when another of the venues from 1958 disappeared.\n\nThe Empire Pool had 1,722 seats, diving boards and the country's only 50m pool - but was flattened as the Millennium Stadium rose up to dominate the city centre in the late '90s.\n\n\"The Empire Pool was an iconic facility in the heart of the capital that not only opened its doors to the world at the 1958 Empire Games, but also served to develop some of our nation's finest athletes,\" said Swim Wales' head of aquatics and inclusion Sioned Williams.\n\n\"To lose this piece of history was a big blow to the Welsh aquatics community.\"\n\nHowever, she said its replacement, the Wales National Pool in Swansea has become a \"thriving hub\" for its elite programme and events, while there is also now an Olympic-sized pool in Cardiff Bay.\n\nOpening ceremony for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Cardiff Arms Park\n\nComing three years after Cardiff was confirmed as capital, the 1958 games were \"a significant moment\" for the nation, according to sports historian Huw Richards.\n\nBut he added: \"It has to be remembered that they were rather smaller than they have since become - with just over 1,100 athletes in 94 events, compared to 5,000 competing in 280 at the most recent games in Birmingham.\"\n\nCardiff Arms Park was where the drama on the track unfolded - but it looked very different then, a 60,000-capacity stadium where Cardiff RFC and the national rugby side played.\n\nA series of redesigns means it now holds 12,500, with the only remaining parts the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates -

I feel a lot of it was blamed on mental health.\"I was told that I should be mindful and getting out in the fresh air, which felt very patronising.\"\n\nEmma said she believed that if her employer were to make some changes, she would be able to return to her role.\n\n\"I was told I'd need to complete a high number of hours on my first week of return - not all illnesses can accommodate strict policy,\" she said.\n\nNicola Allen has recently returned to work with a friend's company\n\nNicola Allen from Whitchurch, Cardiff, started experiencing health issues during pregnancy and was later diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\"I always had the plan that I would return to work when my son was in school full-time, but that didn't happen,\" she said.\n\nNicola had worked in London for many years as an assistant buyer for a popular high street clothes shop.\n\nAfter about eight years out of work, Nicola was recently offered a part-time employment opportunity through a friend's company.\n\nShe said: \"My previous career was demanding so I was nervous, but they were clear they wanted me, as me - and they understood my conditions.\n\n\"I even told them I was frightened, because I didn't want to let them down, or myself down.\"\n\nThe support Nicola is given means she can manage her health as and when she needs to.\n\nShe said she felt more confident as a result.\n\n\"Long-term sick doesn't mean we don't want to work, we do - we're just unfortunately not being given the opportunities that work with our illnesses,\" she said.\n\nAbout 2.5 million people in the UK are not working due to health problems, the Office for National Statistics said.\n\nIt said an increase in mental health issues and people suffering back pain, possibly due to home working, were the main causes of the rise.\n\nTypically, for every 13 people currently working, one person is long-term sick.\n\n\"Figures had started going up before the pandemic but that trend continued into the pandemic and accelerated in 2021 to reach a record high,\" said David Freeman, head of labour markets and household at the Office of National Statistics.\n\nHe said there had been a change in types of illnesses - including post-viral fatigue \"which could be linked to long-Covid\".

The PP and Vox have labelled Mr S\u00e1nchez a \"traitor\" for pardoning jailed pro-independence leaders and downgrading the crime of secession.\n\nOne highly effective right-wing tactic has involved targeting the prime minister with a slogan for relying on separatists to pass key reforms.\n\nHe has been denounced for his pact with Basque separatist party Bildu, led by Arnaldo Otegi, who was jailed for crimes by the Eta militant group.\n\nThe slogan \"Let Txapote vote for you\" accuses Pedro S\u00e1nchez of relying on the support of separatist killers\n\nThe slogan Que te vote Txapote, meaning \"Let Txapote vote for you\", refers to another Eta militant who carried out a number of deadly terror attacks.\n\nAs Spain experiences worsening droughts and heatwaves, most parties have measures to fight climate change. Only Vox's electoral programme fails to mention the issue entirely.\n\nThe biggest issue for most voters is the economy, even if much of the campaign has focused on other issues. Spain is enjoying a period of growth and inflation slowed to below 2% in June, one of the lowest levels in Europe.\n\nBut dismal jobless figures are one of the opposition's most frequent lines of attack against the current government. In May, Spain had the highest unemployment rate (12.7%) of all EU countries.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (L) called the snap election but Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o is favourite to win\n\nHe became the first politician in Spain to snatch power from a sitting prime minister through a no-confidence motion in 2018. Then he narrowly won a confidence vote in January 2020 to form Spain's first coalition government since democracy was restored in the late 1970s.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, is seen as a passionately pro-European integrationist and speaks English fluently; he has lectured in economics in Spain and had a spell working for the UN high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHis brand of governing has been labelled Sanchismo, and his opponents have styled the election as a choice between Sanchismo or Spain, suggesting he is a threat to the country, its traditions and values.\n\nHe has spearheaded a law to bring dignity to victims of dictator Gen Francisco Franco, backed a rule giving workers the right to menstrual leave and laws expanding abortion rights.\n\nBut this snap election could be a gamble too far, as his party trails his conservative rivals. He has accused the PP of seeking to put Spain in a \"sinister time machine\" with the support of far-right Vox and take the country back to \"who knows where\".\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o has been less than enthusiastic about the prospect of a coalition with the far right\n\nThe Popular Party leader has knowingly cultivated a low-key image, saying recently that \"what for some may be boring, I think for the majority of citizens are qualities that a prime minister should have\".\n\nHe was seen to have won the only head-to-head TV election debate with Mr S\u00e1nchez, telling him he had no right to give lectures on governing pacts because the Socialist leader had relied on separatists.\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o was later criticised for skipping the final televised debate before the election, which was attended by both his opponents, Mr S\u00e1nchez and Ms D\u00edaz, and his potential coalition partner, Santiago Abascal.\n\nA former civil servant born in Galicia in Spain's north-west, he has led the conservatives since 2022.\n\nHe has gained a reputation as a safe pair of hands, serving as president of the former national health service and of the postal service.\n\nHowever, his rivals have highlighted 10-year-old rumours that he had a close friendship with a Galician drug trafficker and money launderer called Marcial Dorado.\n\nPhotographs of the two on holiday together on a yacht in 1995 were unearthed by Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds in 2013.\n\nMr Feij\u00f3o says he was unaware Dorado was a criminal when the two became friends because \"back then we had no internet or Google\". Mr S\u00e1nchez has accused Mr Feij\u00f3o of lying, but the PP leader has hit back accusing him of using \"rubbish\" to seek to discredit him.\n\nSantiago Abascal's party takes a hard line on gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, abortion, euthanasia and transgender rights\n\nHe has led the far-right Vox party he helped found in 2014, and he is known for his controversial declarations. He has said he does not believe in climate change and he has criticised the \"totalitarian law of gender ideology\", which he claims criminalises men.\n\nLast month, he used the riots in France to call for tougher immigration policies. \"Europe is threatened by mobs of anti-Europeans\u2026 who are unwilling to adapt to our way of life and our laws,\" he said. \"Europe cannot continue to accept immigrants from Muslim countries.\"\n\nVox has already reached coalition deals with the conservatives in dozens of cities and three autonomous regions - Extremadura in the west, Valencia in the east and Castille and Le\u00f3n, north of Madrid. In the Balearic Islands, Vox have reached a pact with the PP but have no positions in government.\n\nNow Mr Abascal is looking for a share of national power too.\n\nHe has cultivated strong ties with other European far-right and nationalist groups, from Hungary's ruling Fidesz and France's National Rally to the Brothers of Italy party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nMs Meloni has given Vox's election campaign her backing, recording a video to reaffirm the parties' \"great friendship\".\n\nYolanda D\u00edaz has gained popularity in Spain for her headline-grabbing policies\n\nIf Vox are the potential kingmaker for Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, then for the Socialists it would be Yolanda D\u00edaz's Sumar (Unite) alliance of 15 left-wing groups.\n\nA former Communist, she has been Spain's second deputy prime minister as well as labour minister and she is keen to be Spain's first female leader too: \"because women's time has come, and women want to be the ones who make history\".\n\nSumar have made a big pitch for the youth vote, pledging \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,139) of funding to help 18-23 year-olds to kick-start their lives.\n\nMs D\u00edaz is a popular politician who has helped increase the Spanish minimum wage to \u20ac1,259 and scrapped unpopular labour laws.\n\nSparks flew between Ms Diaz and Mr Abascal in the last televised debate before the election as the two clashed over issues of gender violence, while she and Mr S\u00e1nchez appeared to form a united front.\n\nWhile opinion polls have narrowed, the conservatives and Mr Feij\u00f3o are favourites to win. But they may need to form a coalition with Vox to form a majority and avoid repeat elections.\n\nThe last opinion polls published in Spain put the PP on 33%-36% of the vote and the Socialists on under 29%. Vox and Sumar are almost neck and neck on 12.5-13.5%.\n\nTo win an absolute majority a party needs 176 seats, so no party would win outright with these results.\n\nVox has made great strides in securing power-sharing deals with the conservatives in three autonomous regions, and lesser alliances have been reached in Murcia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands,\n\nBut Mr Feij\u00f3o is less than enthusiastic at the prospect of governing with the far right.\n\nThe PP leader has seemed rattled by his rival's accusations of a \"shameful\" pact with Vox.\n\nIn their TV debate Mr Feij\u00f3o said Vox's Mr Abascal would not be a member of a prospective PP government \"if I don't need the votes\". He even offered the Socialists' Mr S\u00e1nchez a pact for the losing party to support the winner so that neither would need to rely on either the hard right or left.\n\nBut Vox could be the only option.

Ms Onasanya did not contest the by-election in her seat, while Mr Davies stood in the by-election and lost.\n\nThe rules of the House of Commons mean that if an MP is suspended for 10 sitting days, a recall petition can be opened in their constituency.\n\nThe petition is open for six weeks, and if 10% of voters in the area sign it, it will trigger a by-election.\n\nSo there are a few hoops to jump through - the suspension is still to be approved by MPs, and given the ongoing parliamentary proceedings against Boris Johnson there is fierce debate about what sanctions should be applied for Covid rule breaches.\n\nMs Ferrier also has the right to appeal the committee's decision.\n\nBut it still seems likely there will be a by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West - a seat which has changed hands at the last three general elections.\n\nMs Ferrier won it for the SNP with a majority of 9.7% in 2019, but it was already a key target for Labour.\n\nAn early contest would be an immediate test for the SNP leader Humza Yousaf - and also for Labour counterparts Sir Keir Starmer and Anas Sarwar, in their quest to spark a revival in former Scottish heartlands.\n\nJoe Flaherty performs onstage during the Second City 20th Anniversary show in Chicago, 1979\n\nJoe Flaherty, the American actor and comedian known for his roles on Freaks and Geeks and the sketch comedy series SCTV, has died at the age of 82.\n\nFlaherty's death was announced by his daughter, Gudrun, who said it came after a \"brief illness\".\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Flaherty got his start in comedy as part of Chicago's improv group The Second City.\n\nHis career spanned nearly five decades, with credits on many beloved television comedies like Frasier and Family Guy.\n\nIn a statement, Gudrun said her father had an \"unwavering passion for movies from the 40s and 50s\", which influenced his career.\n\nShe added that he was particularly fond of his time on SCTV.\n\n\"He cherished every moment spent on the show, so proud of its success and so proud to be part of an amazing cast,\" she said.\n\nComedian Martin Short, Flaherty's former SCTV castmate, said in a statement: \"There were very few people as wise or hilarious when it came to comedy, teaching improvisation and the art of character work as Joe.\n\n\"In SCTV we called him the anchor. In life, he was simply the funniest man in the room. I just adored him.\"\n\nAfter eight years on SCTV, Flaherty was cast on the teen comedy-drama Freaks and Greeks as Harold Weir, the father of two awkward teenagers.\n\nThe series was cancelled after a single season but later became a cult classic and launched the careers of several young actors, including James Franco, Seth Rogen, Busy Philipps, Jason Segel and Linda Cardellini.\n\nFlaherty was also known for a small but memorable role in the 1996 film Happy Gilmore, where he played a heckler who taunts the titular golf player, played by Adam Sandler.\n\nThe actor was beloved not only in his native US but also in Canada, where he had later moved to launch Toronto's arm of the improv troupe The Second City.\n\nCast members from SCTV, including Joe Flaherty (far left) around their star on the Walk of Fame in Toronto, Canada\n\nHe appeared in several Canadian sitcoms and had a guest appearance on Canadian sketch comedy show the Royal Canadian Air Farce.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Adam Sandler said he \"worshipped Joe growing up\".\n\n\"Couldn't be more fun to have him heckle me on the golf course. The nicest guy you could know. Genius of a comedian. And a true sweetheart Perfect combo,\" Sandler wrote.\n\n\"Much love to his kids and thanks to Joe for all the greatness he gave us all.\"\n\n\"I was so thrilled to be able to work with him,\" wrote Jennifer Tilly, who starred alongside Flaherty in the 1997 film The Wrong Guy.\n\n\"His performance was pitch perfect.

However it warned that it may still be prone to sharing disinformation.\n\nGPT-4 will initially be available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, who pay $20 per month for premium access to the service.\n\nIt's already powering Microsoft's Bing search engine platform.

Generative AI uses algorithms and predictive text to create new content based on prompts.\n\nGPT-4 has \"more advanced reasoning skills\" than ChatGPT, OpenAI said. The model can, for example, find available meeting times for three schedules.\n\nOpenAI also announced new partnerships with language learning app Duolingo and Be My Eyes, an application for the visually impaired, to create AI Chatbots which can assist their users using natural language.\n\nHowever, like its predecessors, OpenAI has warned that GPT-4 is still not fully reliable and may \"hallucinate\" - a phenomenon where AI invents facts or makes reasoning errors.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nJust Stop Oil protesters interrupted play twice at Wimbledon by throwing orange-coloured confetti and jigsaw pieces on to court 18.\n\nThe contest between Grigor Dimitrov and Sho Shimabukuro was targeted by two protesters.\n\nA third protester then targeted Katie Boulter's match against Daria Saville.

It's a lot longer than you ever want it to be,\" Fowler said after his record round. \"It's been so worth it and now being back.\"\n\nWhile Fowler tied the US Open record with 10 birdies in his round to counter two bogeys, current Olympic champion Schauffele had eight birdies in a bogey-free round.\n\n\"It's a great start. I hit a lot of really good shots,\" said Schauffele, who like Fowler is yet to win a major. \"Rickie was just right in front of me and I was playing really good golf so thought I may as well just chase him down.\n\n\"You have to play hard here, dig your way around.\"\n\nFor a notoriously slow starter in the majors, McIlroy's 65 on the quirky par-70 layout represents a huge improvement for the Northern Irishman as he looks to end his nine-year wait for a fifth major.\n\nMcIlroy made five front-nine birdies - his best effort in majors - on the back of some explosive driving off the tee.\n\nAnd he played solid golf on the back nine, adding one more birdie before making his only mistake at the 18th - playing an air shot from the greenside rough before making an 11-foot putt to drop just one shot.\n\nJohnson came flying home with five birdies on his back nine but he too made a mistake on the 18th.\n\nHe missed the par-three ninth green by a good 20 yards and his ball plunged into a bunker by the 18th green. He took three from there to drop his only shot of the day and finish two off the lead.\n\n\"The golf course is in perfect condition,\" said Johnson. \"I really like it. You just have to drive it well or you have no chance.\n\n\"The course was set up really nicely. I would imagine the next few days you're going to see the golf course set up as hard as they want to.\"\n\nScheffler, DeChambeau and best of the rest\n\nWorld number one Scheffler bookended his round with a bogey on the first and last, but found a spark around the turn with five birdies in eight holes to card a creditable 67.\n\nThat scored was matched by 2020 US Open champion DeChambeau, who had an eventful round with six birdies and three bogeys.\n\nLocal favourite Max Homa, who was born in Los Angeles and holds the course record of 61, is just a shot further back on two under while Viktor Hovland is one under after a round of highs and lows that included a hole-out eagle from 175 yards and a double-bogey seven.\n\nNorwegian Hovland, 25, has come close in the past three majors, playing in the final groups in both last year's Open Championship and last month's US PGA Championship.\n\nReigning Masters champion Rahm looked largely frustrated with three birdies and two bogeys in his one-under 69.\n\nThe Spaniard has a great record in California, with five of his PGA Tour wins coming in the state - including his 2019 US Open victory at Torrey Pines in nearby San Diego.\n\nJordan Smith is the leading Englishman after shooting a level-par 70 that featured five bogeys and five birdies, while defending champion Matt Fitzpatrick headed to the practice range after signing for a 71.\n\u2022 None Are you in need of a good night's sleep?

Mr Hamada said he could not confirm whether the missile flew over Japan's exclusive economic zone.\n\nSchools in Hokkaido delayed their start times and some train services were suspended, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan's Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Pyongyang's repeated missile launches pose a \"grave and imminent threat\" to Japan's security.\n\nUS National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the latest launch \"needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilising the security situation in the region\".\n\nThis latest launch came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his military to adopt a \"more practical and offensive\" manner in war deterrence, as reported by its state media agency KCNA.\n\nFor the past week, North Korea has not been answering twice-daily phone calls from South Korea, which has concerned the government in Seoul.\n\nThe two Koreas typically exchange calls at 09:00 and 15:00 local time (00:00 and 06:00 GMT) via a military hotline - these daily check-ins are intended to prevent clashes along the countries' border.\n\nEarlier this week, South Korea's Unification Minister Kwon Young-se described the North's suspension of communication as \"unilateral and irresponsible\".\n\n\"Pyongyang's provocations continue past its protest of US-South Korea defence exercises because Kim Jong-un hasn't finished demonstrating his nuclear delivery capabilities yet,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul,\n\n\"However, with the North Koreans literally not answering the phone, the lack of hotlines and diplomacy increases the risk of unintended escalation,\" he said.\n\nThis is an important week for North Korea as it celebrates Mr Kim's 11th year in power - the country tends to mark these anniversaries with displays of military progress.\n\nNorth Korea has been working to increase its nuclear arsenal and build ever-more sophisticated weapons. It has also criticised joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, accusing them of escalating tensions.\n\nThe latest missile launch also comes two days before the", "PPL": 0.5239028334617615, "PPL/lower": 0.6947707571279833, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014728783622765292, "Min-5%": 5.114069464159947, "Min-10%": 3.6193885779848287, "Min-20%": 2.2934274345563503, "Min-30%": 1.6615014744115575, "Min-40%": 1.2866274141712213, "Min-50%": 1.0418893639289308, "Min-60%": 0.8723575781047926}, {"text": "such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access.\n\nOfcom says it is also urging TalkTalk and O2 to introduce social tariffs in the broadband and mobile markets respectively.\n\nAround 4.3 million UK households could be getting cheaper broadband, but only around 220,000 people - or 5% of households - are currently signed up to the offer, according to Ofcom.\n\nConsumer groups are urging customers to act now and look at the packages available - especially given the cost of living crisis.\n\nAs well as being much more affordable, social tariffs are usually on shorter-term contracts. Plus there are no early exit fees - so people are not tied to the contract if their circumstances change, and you can leave without paying a penalty.\n\nAccording to Ofcom's affordability tracker one in three UK households had an issue affording their communication services, reflecting the ongoing pressures that people are facing.\n\nOfcom says more than half of eligible households continue to be unaware of social tariffs and that more needs to be done to encourage people to get the support - a similar plea was made last year.\n\nThe watchdog is concerned that broadband providers are still not being upfront with millions of customers about how to find and sign up to these packages.\n\nOf eligible customers that are aware of social tariffs, most had heard about them through social media and from television.\n\nBut just 9% found out about social tariffs through their provider. Ofcom says that highlights how the industry needs to go further to promote their social tariffs effectively and make them easier to find.\n\nLindsey Fussell, Ofcom's director of network and communication, said she believed broadband providers should go further, \"at a time when these savings could make a massive difference\".\n\n\"We're urging anyone who thinks they could be eligible for a discount deal to contact their provider today and potentially save hundreds of pounds,\" she said.\n\nEver since this row kicked off, I've wondered whether the prime minister had heard about Baroness Hallett's reputation.\n\nIf there were a national prize for Least Likely To Be A Pushover, this tough no-nonsense former Court of Appeal judge would probably win it. Here's why.\n\nThirteen years ago, Lady Justice Hallett, as she then was, oversaw the heart-breaking inquests into the 2005 suicide attacks in London, in which 52 people were killed by four bombers.\n\nMI5 and the Home Office tried to convince her to keep secret what spooks had known about the ringleader of the attacks. I oversimplify, but after some legal trench warfare, Hallett ruled that the bereaved families must know the facts.\n\nMI5's attempt to overturn that decision in the High Court, with the help of the then Home Secretary Theresa May, was so thin that a judge declared part of their argument to be \"hopeless\" .\n\nLady Justice Hallett had called the law right: there is inevitably a place for confidentiality or secrecy when it comes to sensitive national secrets. But there must also be transparency for the victims of an appalling tragedy.\n\nAnd in the aftermath, ministers found themselves accused of a spectacularly clumsy attempt to cover up the truth. I'll leave you to decide whether that sounds familiar...\n\nA multi-million pound fraudster has pleaded guilty to a sophisticated banking scam called iSpoof which stole \u00a3100m from victims worldwide.\n\nLast year the Metropolitan Police texted 70,000 people to warn them their details had been compromised and they had likely been defrauded.\n\nThe fraudsters called people at random, pretending to be a bank warning of suspicious activity on their accounts.\n\nThey would pose as employees of banks including Barclays, Santander, HSBC, Lloyds, Halifax, First Direct, NatWest, Nationwide and TSB.\n\nThe fraudsters would encourage people to disclose security information and, through technology, may have accessed features such as one-time passcodes to clear accounts of funds.\n\nThis is the largest fraud investigation the Metropolitan Police have ever carried out. In the UK alone \u00a343m was lost. One victim lost \u00a33m.\n\nFletcher, 35, of Western Gateway in east London, pleaded guilty to running the iSpoof website which allowed criminals and fraudsters to pretend to be banks and tax offices.\n\nHe admitted charges of making or supplying articles for use in fraud, encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, possessing criminal property and transferring criminal property.\n\n\"He was the ringleader of a slick fraud website which enabled criminals to defraud innocent people of millions of pounds,\" said Det Supt Helen Rance, who led the investigation.\n\n\"We are doing more than ever before to protect Londoners from spoofing and cyber fraud and devised a bespoke plan to reach out to victims who were targeted via iSpoof.\"\n\nLast year, when the fraud emerged, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the Met was contacting mobile numbers connected to the fraudsters for longer than a minute, suggesting a fraud or attempted fraud had taken place.\n\nCriminals paid Fletcher for access to his iSpoof website, transferring up to \u00a35,000 a month in Bitcoin. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US took the site down last year.\n\nFletcher will be sentenced on 18 May at Southwark Crown Court.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. We've got to double down and stick to our plan - Sunak\n\nThis set of by-elections amounts to a single question: just how badly did the Conservatives do?\n\nBut not as badly as they had feared.\n\nThe prospect of a crushing three-nil defeat - beaten everywhere - was averted.\n\nLabour managed to win - and win really big - in rural North Yorkshire; the kind of spot some distance from usually fertile political territory for them.\n\nAnd yet they lost in north west London, where they had expected to win.\n\nBut, but, but: the Tory obliteration in Somerset will sow panic among many Conservatives in the south west of England.\n\nSo let's unpick where this leaves us, because on the face of it is a rather messy picture.\n\nTo what extent were these contests atypical, by-election quirks rather than true indicators of the national mood?\n\nFirstly, Labour's victory in Selby and Ainsty is off the scale big.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

We are looking very hard at this.\"\n\nIt comes after the killer of Zara Aleena in east London, Jordan McSweeney, refused to attend his sentencing, something her family described as \"a slap in the face\".\n\nThomas Cashman would not face the family of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel either, as he was jailed for life for her murder in Liverpool.\n\nThe historic criminal indictment against former US President Donald Trump has sparked another partisan flashpoint in an already deeply polarised nation.\n\nAhead of his court appearance next Tuesday, voters have been sharing with the BBC their strongly felt reactions to the first prosecution of a former president.\n\nWhatever their political affiliation, most of our voter panel agreed that the unprecedented case leaves the US in uncharted waters.\n\nThis is an excellent example of the politicisation of the judiciary. It's a huge mistake. Banana republic style vindictiveness. It's, in my opinion, totally undermining our rule of law and sets the US up for real trouble ahead. It's a huge mess and completely destructive.\n\nThis action taken by the New York district attorney destroys any respect for the rule of law that many in the public had. It does not inspire trust or confidence in our system. It is very worrisome.\n\nAgain, can't stress it enough - it's a huge mistake and the ramifications are going to be deep and far reaching. I worry for the times ahead in our country. We're heading into turbulent times and our institutions and customs will be tested like we've never seen before. I hope our republic can survive - all because of a vindictive and petty, hypocritical step by a 'smallish' prosecutor in New York.\n\nThis is one of many things that he should be charged with, and more presidents should be charged with more wrongdoing than just Trump.\n\nI think that denying prosecution of a public or political figure is itself an inherently political move. Presidents should absolutely be held to the same - or higher standards - of public scrutiny and lawful consequences.\n\nHe should absolutely face prosecution. I genuinely think that the battle lines in the country have already been drawn. I think that people have made up their minds about Trump. They love him or hate him and I don't see that changing.\n\nI feel they want to put a 'stain' on Donald Trump's character - as no other president has been criminally charged in our US history.\n\nI am surprised that they actually indicted him. This looks very bad for our country and for Trump to run in 2024. The news will focus on this more than anything that Trump has accomplished, and it will have a negative impact on Trump's run for 2024.\n\nI'm saddened to see this happen and do not agree with the Manhattan jury. I hope Trump can pick a good running mate - he is going to need it.\n\nThese are indeed uncharted times we are embarking on. Living in the New York area, we are a bit on guard but overall I believe these growing pains are necessary for us as a country to affirm who we are - a country where no-one is above the law.\n\nIt's hard to find a person who believes the former president didn't break laws, they simply debate whether he should be charged, which in itself says a lot about the vulnerability of our democracy right now.\n\nFor me, it's a naked and blatantly gross breach of responsibility by the Manhattan district attorney that goes beyond anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It is an embarrassment that in this country, things have gotten to the point where an extreme stretch in interpretation of the law could be used in an attempt to take out a political opponent.\n\nThis is the stuff of banana republics and countries that have been or are under the control of dictatorial power. Moreover, I think the Manhattan district attorney, with all that is on his plate with regards to crime in his jurisdiction, is so out of touch to want to go after a former president instead of focusing on the immediate needs of his electorate.\n\nI predict this will come back to haunt Biden in the 2024 election cycle that is just now getting underway - look for Republicans to pull all the stops going after the president and his son in their investigations.\n\nI'm glad that the law applies to everyone. I look forward to him having to answer for himself and let a jury decide. I'm comfortable letting the system do it's job.\n\nI'm also really sad that this day has come to the US. The fact that this took a long time to happen is good - this wasn't some rush to achieve a pre-defined objective. I'm also hoping Trump is healthy at least long enough to see this to its conclusion.\n\nI also think that if Trump could watch Michael Cohen get convicted for campaign finance crimes he committed for him, it will likely make it easier to prove that there was in fact a federal crime connected to the money. I'm sure Cohen will feel vindicated.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA man has been arrested after one person was left in a life-threatening condition and another was injured in a stabbing attack at a London hospital.\n\nPolice said the man arrested at Central Middlesex Hospital in Park Royal also sustained \"self-inflicted\" injuries.\n\nThe hospital was temporarily locked down but has since reopened with a heightened police presence.\n\nOne witness described how patients and visitors were locked in a nurses' room while police dealt with the incident.\n\nStaff were evacuated from the hospital building, where officers will remain as searches are carried out.\n\nThe Met Police said it was satisfied no-one else was being sought and that the stabbings were not being treated as terror-related.\n\nThe attack was reported at about 13:20 BST.

Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry that \"it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died\".\n\nEngland's former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies was close to tears at the Covid Inquiry as she apologised to families bereaved by the pandemic.\n\n\"It wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died... it was harrowing and it remains horrible,\" she said.\n\nShe also said the UK did not have enough resilience to cope with the pandemic, with fewer doctors, nurses or hospital beds than similar countries.\n\nThe inquiry is currently examining the UK's preparedness ahead of Covid.\n\nIn her evidence, Dame Sally also expressed concern about the impact of the lockdowns on children and students.\n\n\"We have damaged a generation, and it is awful... watching these people struggle,\" she said.\n\nThe former chief medical officer told the inquiry the UK did not have plans in place to cope with a Covid pandemic, but she added \"it didn't have resilience either\".\n\nCompared with similar countries, the UK was at the bottom of the table for numbers of doctors, nurses, beds, IT units and ventilators per 100,000, she said.\n\nDuring questions about preparation exercises for pandemics, Dame Sally broke off to say: \"Maybe this is the moment to say how sorry I am to the relatives who lost their families.\"\n\n\"I heard a lot about it from my daughter who was on the front line as a doctor in Scotland,\" she added.\n\nDame Sally Davies became chief medical officer in 2010 and left in 2019 to be replaced by Sir Chris Whitty. He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.\n\nAt the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic.\n\nThe former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic.\n\nLast week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services.\n\nAsked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"\n\nHe accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.\n\n\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.\n\nHe said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending.\n\nDuring the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending.\n\nGeorge Osborne was quizzed on the impact of spending cuts\n\nMr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.\n\n\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\"\n\nThe British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\".\n\nOn Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid.\n\nDuring the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown.\n\nHe said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".\n\n\"There was no", "PPL": 0.6955593228340149, "PPL/lower": 0.7624080664976194, "PPL/zlib": 0.00019288944060843452, "Min-5%": 6.194165814156626, "Min-10%": 4.642958483275245, "Min-20%": 3.0488212408821274, "Min-30%": 2.230069559783423, "Min-40%": 1.721774014145646, "Min-50%": 1.3877217948003395, "Min-60%": 1.1585846680553225}, {"text": "one male back inside to assist special forces operatives with a search.\n\nBut senior officers became concerned by the frequency with which the squadron's own accounts described detainees being taken back inside buildings and then grabbing for hidden weapons - an enemy tactic not reported by other British military forces operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThere were also concerns among officers that on a significant number of raids, there were more people killed than weapons reportedly recovered from the scene - suggesting the SAS was shooting unarmed people - and that SAS operatives might be falsifying evidence by dropping weapons at scenes after killing people.\n\nAfter similar concerns were raised in Australia, a judge-led inquiry was commissioned and found \"credible evidence\" members of Australian Special Forces were responsible for the unlawful killing 39 people, and used 'drop weapons' in an attempt to justify shootings.\n\nBy April 2011, the concerns were so great in the UK that a senior special forces officer wrote to the director of special forces warning that there was evidence of \"deliberate killing of individuals after they have been restrained\" and \"fabrication of evidence to suggest a lawful killing in self-defence\".\n\nTwo days later, the UK Special Forces assistant chief of staff warned the director that the SAS could be operating a policy to \"kill fighting-aged males on target even when they did not pose a threat.\"\n\nIf the suspicions were true, he wrote, the SAS squadron had \"strayed into indefensible ethical and legal behaviour\".\n\nThe SAS squadron operated in some of the most dangerous areas in southern Afghanistan, often raiding residential compounds in villages\n\nThe BBC visited several of the homes raided by the SAS squadron in 2010/11. At one, in a small village in Nad Ali in Helmand, there was a bricked up guesthouse where nine Afghan men including a teenager were killed in the early hours of 7 February 2011.\n\nThe SAS operatives arrived in helicopters under the cover of darkness and approached the house from a nearby field. According to their account, insurgents opened fire at them, prompting them to shoot back and kill everyone in the guesthouse.\n\nOnly three AK-47s were recovered, according to the SAS account - one of at least six raids by the squadron on which the reported number of enemy weapons was fewer than the number of people killed.\n\nInside the guesthouse, what appeared to be bullet holes from the raid were clustered together on the walls low to the ground. The BBC showed photographs from the scene to ballistics experts, who said that the clusters suggested multiple rounds had been fired downward from above, and did not appear indicative of a firefight.\n\nLeigh Neville, an expert on weapons used by UK Special Forces, said the bullet patterns suggested that \"targets were low to the ground, either prone or in a sitting or crouching position close to the wall - an unusual position if they were actively involved in a firefight\".\n\nThe same pattern was visible at two other locations examined by the BBC. Ballistics experts who reviewed images said the bullet holes were suggestive of execution-style killings rather than firefights.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an RMP investigator confirmed to the BBC that they had seen photographs from the scenes and that the bullet mark patterns had raised alarm.\n\n\"You can see why we were concerned,\" the investigator said. \"Bullet marks on the walls so low to the ground appeared to undermine the special forces' version of events.\"\n\nIn 2014, the RMP launched Operation Northmoor, a wide-ranging investigation into more than 600 alleged offences by British forces in Afghanistan, including a number of killings by the SAS squadron. But RMP investigators told the BBC that they were obstructed by British military in their efforts to gather evidence.\n\nOperation Northmoor was wound down in 2017 and eventually closed in 2019. The Ministry of Defence has said that no evidence of criminality was found. Members of the investigations team told the BBC they dispute that conclusion.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said British troops were held to the highest standards. \"No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a further statement, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to \"unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already been fully investigated\".\n\nIt said: \"We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute. Insinuating otherwise is irresponsible, incorrect and puts our brave Armed Forces personnel at risk both in the field and reputationally.\n\n\"The Ministry of Defence of course stands open to considering any new evidence, there would be no obstruction. But in the absence of this, we strongly object to this subjective reporting.\"\n\nShareholders in Credit Suisse have told the firm they feel \"failed\" and \"cheated\" after the collapsed bank was rescued by its long-time rival UBS.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 167-year old Swiss bank faced investors for the first time since the deal was struck and for the last time as an independent firm.\n\nCredit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann said he was \"truly sorry\".\n\nBut one investor told the bank that shareholders had \"everything stolen from them\".\n\nCredit Suisse was rescued by UBS last month in a deal brokered by authorities after turmoil in the US banking sector sent the Swiss lender's shares tumbling.\n\nThe loss-making bank had already been struggling for a number of years after a series of scandals, compliance problems and bad financial bets.\n\nMr Lehmann told investors at the Annual General Meeting that management had a plan to turn things around but had been \"thwarted\" by fears prompted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US.\n\nBut one shareholder suggested the board would have been crucified in medieval times.\n\nAnother held up a sack of empty walnut shells, saying they cost the same as a single Credit Suisse share.\n\nCredit Suisse's chief executive Ulrich Korner said: \"I understand that you feel disappointed, shocked, or angry.\n\n\"I share the disappointment of you, our shareholders, but I also share the disappointment of all of our employees, our clients and, ultimately, the general public.\"\n\nShareholders in both Credit Suisse and UBS - which will hold an investor meeting on Wednesday - have been denied a vote on the takeover because of the emergency measures taken by the Swiss government to rush the deal through.\n\nMr Lehmann said the only other option would have been bankruptcy.\n\n\"This would have led to the worst scenario, namely a total loss for shareholders, unpredictable risks for clients, severe consequences for the economy and the global financial markets,\" he said.\n\n\"It was our duty to protect the interests of our shareholders as best we could to provide security to our clients. We did everything we could within what was possible.\"\n\nCredit Suisse bosses knew they would have to eat humble pie at this meeting, but despite numerous apologies the shareholders remain angry.\n\nIt's common for middle-class Swiss people, especially the elderly, to invest money in a few shares as a back-up to their pensions. What have they traditionally considered safe? Switzerland's two biggest banks. But now Credit Suisse shares are worth less than 10% of what they were two years ago.\n\nOne man representing a group of shareholders accused Credit Suisse management of \"greed and incompetence\", another pointed to his red tie, saying he was wearing it to represent the \"red card\" Credit Suisse deserved.\n\nOthers turned their anger on the Swiss government, which forced through the takeover by UBS over just one weekend while the markets were closed. Some of us, said one shareholder, spend more time choosing our smartphones.\n\nVenting their anger is just about the only action the shareholders can take; the deal with UBS is done. Apologising again, CEO Ulrich Korner said there had been little choice, it was either take the deal with UBS or bankruptcy, which he said would have been catastrophic not just for Switzerland, but for the entire global economy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Temperatures above 50C have been recorded in China and the US, where body bags filled with ice are being used to cool hospital patients. The UK has just had its hottest ever June.\n\nAnd in 2022, the UK recorded a temperature above 40C for the first time. Last year's heatwave has been blamed for 60,000 deaths across Europe.\n\nIt's no wonder the United Nations has warned we now live in the era of \"global boiling\".\n\n\"I think it's really important to realise it's no longer just something that's distant or far away from us or something in the future. We are really seeing it now,\" says Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office.\n\nSo what does the changing climate mean for our bodies and our health?\n\nI tend to collapse into a sweaty puddle when it gets hot, but I've been invited to take part in a heatwave experiment.\n\nProf Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales wants to give me a typical heatwave encounter. So we're going to start at 21C, crank up the thermostat to 35C and then finally up to 40.3C - equivalent to the UK's hottest day.\n\n\"You will be sweating and your body's physiology is going to change quite considerably,\" Prof Bailey warns me.\n\nProf Bailey leads me into his environmental chamber. It's a room-sized piece of scientific equipment that can precisely control the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels inside this airtight space.\n\nI've been here once before to explore the effects of cold.\n\nBut the shiny steel walls, heavy door and tiny portholes take on new meaning in anticipation of the temperature being cranked up.\n\nI feel like I'm staring out of my oven.\n\nThe temperature starts at a perfectly pleasant 21C when the first instruction to \"completely strip everything off\" comes from Prof Bailey.\n\nIn response to a raised eyebrow, I'm reassured we're going to work out how sweaty I get, by seeing how my weight changes.\n\nJames getting wired up for the experiment inside the environmental chamber at the University of South Wales.\n\nNext, I'm connected to a dizzying array of gizmos tracking the temperature of my skin and my internal organs, my heart rate and blood pressure. A huge mouthpiece analyses the air I exhale and an ultrasound inspects the flow of blood to my brain through the carotid arteries in my neck.\n\n\"Blood pressure is working nicely, heart rate is working nicely, all of the physiological signals at the moment are telling me that you're in spiffing shape,\" Prof Bailey tells me.\n\nWe have one quick brain test to complete - memorising a list of 30 words - and then the fans kick in. The temperature is starting to rise.\n\nMy body has one simple goal - to keep the core temperature around my heart, lungs, liver and other organs at about 37C.\n\n\"The thermostat in the brain, or hypothalamus, is constantly tasting the temperature, then it sends out all of these signals to try to maintain that,\" says Prof Bailey.\n\nWe take a pause at 35C to take some more measurements. It's warm in here now. It's not uncomfortable - I'm just relaxing in a chair - but I wouldn't want to work or exercise in this.\n\nProf Bailey is also feeling the heat inside the chamber\n\nSome changes in my body are already clear. I look redder. Damian does too, he's stuck in here with me. That's because the blood vessels near the surface of my skin are opening up to make it easier for my warm blood to lose heat into the air.\n\nAlso I'm sweating - not dripping, but positively glistening - and as the sweat evaporates, that cools me down.\n\nWe then plough on to 40.3C, and now I feel like the heat is pounding me.\n\n\"It's not linear, it's exponential. Five degrees centigrade [more] doesn't sound much, but it really is physiologically so much more of a challenge,\" Prof Bailey says.\n\nI'm glad we're not going higher. When I wipe my hand across my brow it is sodden.

It seems the only \"deliverable\" from the meetings, in diplomatic parlance, will be that the meetings have happened at all.\n\nDon't expect some sort of breakthrough or transformation in the way that the two deal with one another, said Daniel J Kritenbrink, the State Department's senior East Asia diplomat.\n\nIf the meeting leads to further interaction between US and Chinese officials, that would be something both sides could build on.\n\nPresident Biden's relations with China started off on a rocky note, in part because he has been unwilling to cancel trade measures enacted by his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nThat includes billions of dollars in import tariffs on Chinese-made products.\n\nIn some areas, Mr Biden has squeezed even harder, with restrictions on US computer-chip exports to China in an effort to maintain US superiority in the most advanced electronics technologies.\n\nChina responded by enacting its own ban on computer memory chips sold by Micron, the largest US manufacturer.\n\nMr Campbell acknowledged China's concerns but said the US would defend and explain what it's done so far and what could lie ahead.\n\nIf computer technology is an area destined for fierce competition between the two superpowers, the illicit drug trade may provide more room for co-operation.\n\nThe US wants to limit the export of Chinese-produced chemical components used to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more powerful than heroin.\n\nThe rate of US drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl has more than tripled in the last seven years.\n\n\"This is an absolutely critical and urgent issue for the United States,\" said Mr Kritenbrink - but it is one that presents its own challenges.\n\nAfter the balloon incident, there were reports that China was considering sending weapons to Russia, where they would be immediately used in the war against Ukraine.\n\nUS government officials have backed away from those accusations of late, removing what could have been a particularly contentious issue for the two nations that risked turning the Ukraine-Russia conflict into a proxy war between the US and China.\n\nRemote Philippine islands are on the frontlines of US-China tensions\n\nBut expect Mr Blinken to echo warnings given to the Chinese in Vienna that there would be serious consequences if China gives military and financial assistance to Russia.\n\nUS and Chinese warships have been facing off in a high-stakes game of chicken over the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. China claims the area as their own, while the US insists they are international waters.\n\nMr Blinken and his diplomatic team have said that his goal in this trip is to \"de-risk\" the tensions, and renewed communication is the place to start.\n\nAchieving more may be a tall task for now - and more extensive co-operation could become more difficult for Mr Biden as anti-China rhetoric in Washington is sure to heat up when the 2024 presidential elections approach.\n\nA satisfactory outcome from this trip for both sides might be simply the opening of communication channels that prevent an incident leading to military conflict.\n\nPoppy Devey Waterhouse and Ellie Gould were murdered by their ex-boyfriends\n\nA barrister who led a review into how domestic killers are sentenced said she is \"disappointed\" her report has not been adopted in full.\n\nClare Wade recommended 17 reforms she said were needed to ensure justice for victims of abuse in serious cases.\n\nThe government is proceeding with some of them initially, including longer sentences for killers with a history of coercive control or extreme violence.\n\nJustice Secretary Dominic Raab said other proposals are being considered.\n\nMs Wade's report - published on Friday - recognised that the majority of people killed in domestic cases where there is a background of abuse are women attacked by men.\n\nIt was commissioned following the deaths of Ellie Gould 17, and Poppy Devey Waterhouse, 24, who were both stabbed to death in their homes by male partners.\n\nUnder the government's plans, judges will be required by law to consider a history of coercive or controlling behaviour as an aggravating factor when deciding on a jail term, meaning those offenders will serve longer behind bars.\n\nChanges will also ensure judges hand down longer sentences where \"overkill\" - or excessive violence - has been used.\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he is committed to cracking down on violence against women - but the head of the review warned the proposals \"won't achieve the justice they are intended to achieve if they are all only implemented in part\".\n\nMs Wade was asked by the government in September 2021 to review sentencing guidelines after ministers were warned about \"systemic misogyny within the criminal justice system\" by the victims' commissioner and domestic abuse commissioner.\n\nShe said she was concerned the government is pressing ahead with making a history of controlling or coercive behaviour an aggravating factor - but without enshrining it in law as a mitigating factor for when victims who kill their abusers.\n\nMs Wade, who was the defence barrister for Sally Challen when she became the first woman to have her murder conviction quashed under coercive control laws, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's approach \"will make matters much worse for women who kill their abusive partners\".\n\nMr Raab told the BBC he was \"very sympathetic\" to the mitigation argument but insisted he would take time between now and the summer to", "PPL": 0.6986912488937378, "PPL/lower": 0.8180327245358651, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001796583309060781, "Min-5%": 5.355583812676224, "Min-10%": 4.085376525626463, "Min-20%": 2.799651620440495, "Min-30%": 2.1211494474341115, "Min-40%": 1.6816006578996887, "Min-50%": 1.3771274869101722, "Min-60%": 1.1590556037044972}, {"text": "record and make promises about a bright future for America if he is elected, it was clear that his legal troubles - and possible impending arrest - were foremost in his mind.\n\nThe ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre\n\nAn 88-year-old German man has been charged with involvement in one of the most infamous World War Two massacres.\n\nThe charges relate to Oradour-sur-Glane in central France, where 642 people were murdered by SS troops in 1944.\n\nMany were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire.\n\nProsecutors in Dortmund said the man had been charged over the murder of 25 people and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred.\n\nThe ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre, as a permanent memorial.\n\nFrench leader General Charles de Gaulle said it should be a reminder of the cruelty of the Nazi occupation.\n\nSome 60 soldiers were brought to trial in the 1950s.

Almost half the electorate in this deeply polarised country did not back his authoritarian vision of Turkey.\n\nUltimately, Mr Kilicdaroglu was no match for the well-drilled Erdogan campaign, even if he took the president to a run-off second round for the first time since the post was made directly elected in 2014.\n\nBut he barely dented his rival's first-round lead, falling more than two million votes behind.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe president made the most of his victory, with an initial speech to supporters atop a bus in Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, followed after dark by a balcony address from his palace to an adoring crowd that he numbered at 320,000 people.\n\n\"It is not just us who won, Turkey won,\" he declared, calling it one of the most important elections in Turkish history.\n\nHe taunted his opponent's defeat with the words \"Bye, bye, Kemal\" - a chant that was also taken up by his supporters in Ankara.\n\nMr Erdogan poured scorn on the main opposition party's increase in its number of MPs in the parliamentary vote two weeks earlier. The true number had fallen to 129, he said, because the party had handed over dozens of seats to its allies.\n\nHe also condemned the opposition alliance's pro-LGBT policies, which he said were in contrast with his own focus on families.\n\nThe run-up to the vote had become increasingly rancorous and in one incident late on Sunday, an opposition Good party official was fatally stabbed in front of a party office in the northern coastal town of Ordu.\n\nThe motive for Erhan Kurt's killing was not clear, but a leading opposition official blamed youths celebrating the election result.\n\nAlthough the final results were not confirmed, the Supreme Election Council said there was no doubt who had won.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the palace complex to be opened to the public - but so was this result, extending his period in power to a quarter of a century.\n\nSupporters came from all over Ankara to taste the victory. There were Islamic chants, while some laid Turkish flags on the grass to pray.\n\nFor a night, Turkey's economic crisis was forgotten. One supporter, Seyhan, said it was all a lie: \"Nobody is hungry. We are very happy with his economy policies. He will do even better in the next five years.\"\n\nBut the president admitted that tackling inflation was Turkey's most urgent issue.\n\nThe question is whether he is prepared to take the necessary measures to do so. At an annual rate of almost 44%, inflation seeps into everyone's lives.\n\nThe cost of food, rent and other everyday goods has soared, exacerbated by Mr Erdogan's refusal to observe orthodox economic policy and raise interest rates.\n\nThe Turkish lira has hit record lows against the dollar and the central bank has struggled to meet surging demand for foreign currency.\n\n\"If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter capital controls,\" warns Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc university in Istanbul.\n\nEconomics was far from the minds of Erdogan supporters, who spoke of their pride at his powerful position in the world and his hard line on fighting \"terrorists\", by which they meant Kurdish militants.\n\nPresident Erdogan has accused his opposite number of siding with terrorists, and criticised him for promising to free a former co-leader of Turkey's second largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas has been languishing in jail since 2016, despite the European Court of Human Rights ordering his release.\n\nMr Erdogan said while he was in power, Mr Demirtas would stay behind bars.\n\nHe also promised to prioritise rebuilding in areas hit by February's twin earthquakes and bring about the \"voluntary\" return of a million Syrian refugees.\n\nCrowds f", "PPL": 0.627103865146637, "PPL/lower": 0.7064001683910297, "PPL/zlib": 0.0001764005246544689, "Min-5%": 6.225578897139606, "Min-10%": 4.714294088821785, "Min-20%": 2.9641278949372634, "Min-30%": 2.060412066245409, "Min-40%": 1.561783651277095, "Min-50%": 1.2526764127290202, "Min-60%": 1.044759171691432}], "retain": [{"text": "own inquiry into the pandemic, calls for which have been resisted by the Welsh government.\n\nLucy O'Brien, a lawyer with extensive experience in public inquiries and judicial reviews, said she was concerned that the Senedd committee would not have the resources to adequately scrutinise decisions made during the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \"With an independent public inquiry, the inquiry would be resourced to approach witnesses and compel evidence and hold public hearings.\n\n\"Say the UK public inquiry found there were issues with care homes in Wales and that was part of Baroness Hallett's recommendations, would the Senedd committee then be contacting care homes in Wales to obtain evidence?

She runs accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens, which has advised brands like Netflix and Starbucks on how to make their businesses more disability-friendly.\n\n\"Sin\u00e9ad taught me that retail spaces are quite unfriendly to people with disabilities and that photographic studios are not designed to cater for them,\" Enninful said.\n\n\"She has really opened my eyes and taught me that a whole group of people are being ignored.\"\n\nSin\u00e9ad Burke was consulted by Vogue on its disability issue and also appears as a cover star\n\nBurke spoke to the BBC's Access All podcast about making sure all Vogue photoshoots for the issue were suitable.\n\n\"We surveyed every studio to learn what level of accessibility existed and then ensured the talent was set up to meaningfully participate,\" she said.\n\n\"What makes this issue so different is the way in which we think about visibility and representation moving from something that is solely based on image and the cover, to being in the room where decisions are made so that it's not a moment, it's a movement.\"\n\nBritish Vogue said it hopes to represent some of the 16 million people living with invisible and visible disabilities in the UK, and show how the fashion industry can be more inclusive.\n\nEnninful, who got the top job at British Vogue in 2017 and became European editorial director of Vogue in 2020, said he hopes to make the publication a more inclusive workplace.\n\n\"We want to carry this on and for people to see Vogue is taking that step... We're not perfect, but we have to create this welcoming space,\" he said.\n\nOne of the covers features Justina Miles, a deaf sign language interpreter who performed at Rihanna's Super Bowl half time show\n\nIt's an issue that got some media attention earlier this year when Victoria Jenkins appeared on BBC show Dragon's Den.\n\nHaving become disabled in her 20s, Jenkins discovered there were very few fashionable clothes on the market for people like her.\n\nShe founded her own brand Unhidden to cater for various disabilities.\n\nI mentioned this to Enninful, and my own concerns as someone who has had inflammatory bowel disease for nearly 20 years and has had to resort to pyjamas and tracksuit bottoms during a flare-up or operation to feel comfortable.\n\n\"I always have conversations with designers and it's something we'll carry on with,\" Enninful said.\n\n\"But I think the more you raise awareness of what people go through, the more people will start thinking how they can be more inclusive.\"\n\nAaron Rose Philip appears on one of the Vogue covers - she is the first black, transgender and physically disabled model to receive a major modelling contract\n\nEnninful said a big part of shooting this Vogue campaign involved making those involved feel like there was a place in the fashion industry for them.\n\nMany people with both visible and hidden disabilities have not felt seen in the media, especially on the front of glossy and often airbrushed magazine covers.\n\n\"There were a lot of tears - a lot of them [models] didn't think photoshoots were for them and couldn't believe they were involved,\" he replied.\n\n\"Ellie [Goldstein] said it was her dream to be on the cover of Vogue and she said, seven years ago people would have laughed at her, but there she is, and everybody deserves to be seen.\n\n\"When this issue comes out, I hope a lot of disabled people will look at it and say, not only can I see myself on the pages of Vogue, but also in fashion.\"\n\nA 50-year-old man arrested on suspicion of killing a well-known drag queen has been released without charge.\n\nSouth Wales Police said it had ended its investigation and was not looking for anyone else in connection with the death of Darren Haydn Meah-Moore, 39.\n\nMr Meah-Moore's body was found in a lane close to Windsor", "PPL": 0.878391444683075, "PPL/lower": 0.7936728224351733, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002468084980845954, "Min-5%": 6.899659484040503, "Min-10%": 5.335588338328343, "Min-20%": 3.6986306579305372, "Min-30%": 2.7633256502570855, "Min-40%": 2.158885529870509, "Min-50%": 1.7491748459702712, "Min-60%": 1.4625144023167618}, {"text": "friend had done was the \"ultimate betrayal and humiliation\".\n\nShe says: \"I re-lived every conversation that we had, where he had comforted me and supported me and been kind to me.

This meant black officers were 81% more likely to be involved in misconduct hearings than their white counterparts, it found.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It's just unbelievable. They're sick.\"\n\n\"You think this might have happened decades ago but to still happen now, it just shows nothing has changed. I have no faith in the people here because it just goes on and on. I wish those people could feel what we feel. They deserve to suffer the pain racism makes us feel.\"\n\nAn anonymous Asian officer said they had been told on duty they \"smell of curry\", that they look \"dirty\" and \"filthy\" and \"need to have a wash\".\n\nThe same officer said the force's \"canteen culture, as it's called, is so deep and strong that it's impossible to get rid of\".\n\nBaroness Casey spoke to serving officers as part of her investigation. One black female officer said she felt she \"had to try to be invisible\", or risk getting \"a reputation as a troublemaker\".\n\nA former senior officer recounted the \"humiliating\" experience of being stopped and searched, and another black officer said colleagues had on occasion mistaken him for a prisoner or potential intruder in police stations.\n\nAnother black female officer said they witnessed a white officer using highly offensive racist language to verbally abuse a white woman who had been caught buying drugs from a black man.\n\nThe report found a persistent view among some in the Met that people from ethnic minorities who progress only do so because of positive action initiatives.\n\nOne senior officer said they were openly asked in a large meeting in 2022 \"did you get where you got to because you are black?\".\n\nA Sikh officer told Baroness Casey they \"don't feel comfortable\" telling others from their community to join the force.\n\nAnother told Baroness Casey: \"The ugly truth is that the organisation is riddled with racism - how much have people like me acquiesced?\"\n\nShabnam Chaudhri, a former detective superintendent for the Met, said the report made for \"very hard reading\".\n\n\"I was shocked, I didn't think I could be,\" she told the BBC's Asian Network. \"I feel for all of the officers that are having to endure behaviour like this.\"\n\nBut the former detective said that, while Baroness Casey \"did a brilliant review,\" she would suspect \"there were areas\" of policing affecting South Asian and minority officers that \"hadn't been covered\" by the report as \"they might have been scared they were identified and subjected to further victimisation\".\n\nAbdul, who lives in London, told Asian Network that he was first searched by police at the age of 13.\n\nHe said: \"I went to a funfair in Mile End (in east London), and I had some tissues in my pocket. The police started searching me because they thought they were drugs.\n\n\"The way the police operate with younger people is aggressive, defensive\u2026 if they approach them in an aggressive manner, of course they're going to get the same back.\"\n\nSir Mark Rowley has accepted there are systemic biases within the Met and says he is committed to rooting out racist, homophobic and misogynistic staff.\n\nBut his decision not to endorse the word \"institutional\" was criticised by Mina Smallman, whose daughters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were murdered in London in June 2020. Two Met officers were subsequently jailed for sharing images of their bodies in a WhatsApp group.\n\nSir Mark said the word institutional is ambiguous and has been politicised.\n\nNicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing\n\nMs Smallman said that black people will read the report and feel \"we've been saying this for years\".\n\nShe told the BBC \"I kind of understand what he's trying to say,\" but added: \"You have to accept this. This [institutional] is a term that the Met and big institutions fear and run away from.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I think it's weak. That weakened him,\" adding: \"It's not a time for wordplay or semantics. It's a time for action.\"\n\nResponding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Sir Mark should \"go further and faster\" to uncover the systemic problems within the Met.\n\nSetting out his view on how Labour would raise confidence in police forces across the UK, he said the party will be \"relentless in demanding progress and change\".\n\nHe added: \"The biggest danger today is that this just becomes another report.\"\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said the report makes \"very concerning reading\" and shows the force \"faces a long road to recovery\".", "PPL":

denied an appointment despite having two broken teeth.\n\nThe Welsh government said it has increased funding for dentistry.\n\nLast year a BBC investigation found that in 11 out of 22 local authorities in Wales, 100% of dentistry practices contacted were unable to accept new patients.\n\nMs Wellings said on moving to Cardiff five years ago she immediately tried to find an NHS dentist

got the metal stud where the crown was.\n\n\"But unless your face is actually swollen you can't get an emergency appointment.\"\n\nMrs Dickinson said the metal stud cuts her tongue and catches her cheek.\n\nShe said she also has another tooth with a hole in it, and is \"worried about having smelly breath\".\n\nAnd after her husband drove for an hour to Amlwch to have a tooth \"pulled\", she said he was \"told off for not seeing the dentist more often\".\n\nMrs Dickinson and her husband have to live off about \u00a3900 a month after she was forced to retire early because of ill

2019 and ended up travelling back to her home city of Leeds to see an NHS dentist.\n\nMs Manson said: \"A year or so later I again rung about 30 dentists, and none were accepting NHS.\"\n\nIt took four years for Heather Manson to get an NHS appointment in Wales\n\nAfter managing to get herself onto the Cardiff and Vale generic dental waiting list in August 2022 she said she never heard back about an appointment.\n\nBut a month later Ms Manson decided to go private, because \"it had been years\" since she last had her teeth checked and she \"thought it was the only option\".\n\nHowever, she was able to get an NHS appointment before she had to pay for private health care and has had a \"smooth sailing experience\".\n\nMs Manson said she thinks \"oral hygiene is very important and should be a service that everyone is entitled to easily\".\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr health board's assistant dental services director Peter Greensmith said: \"We were very sorry to hear about the

Watch: The highlights of an unusual trial - in 2 minutes\n\nHollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow has thanked jurors who found her not liable for a 2016 ski crash at a resort in the US state of Utah.\n\nRetired optometrist Terry Sanderson, 76, had said Ms Paltrow crashed into him, inflicting life-changing injuries.\n\nMr Sanderson, who was seeking $300,000 (\u00a3245,000) in damages, said Thursday's verdict was \"very disappointing\".\n\nJurors sided with Ms Paltrow, 50, who blamed Mr Sanderson for the accident and countersued for $1 plus legal fees.\n\nListening to the verdict in court", "PPL": 1.2536038160324097, "PPL/lower": 0.8736391538220998, "PPL/zlib": 0.00035492746773284535, "Min-5%": 7.082011208814733, "Min-10%": 5.857910471804002, "Min-20%": 4.442386342727176, "Min-30%": 3.550364207949623, "Min-40%": 2.9170134020172296, "Min-50%": 2.4472199803981147, "Min-60%": 2.0782400590249304}, {"text": "front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that \"we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions\". He had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones.\n\nGov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to visit the front and acknowledge shortcomings, even in a coded way, marks an interesting contrast with his boss.\n\nWhen local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: \"I'm wishing you good health, success, completion of all tasks\u2026 and that you return home alive.\"\n\nThe call-up of paratroopers, part of Russia's wider mobilisation, underlines the degree to which the Ukraine campaign has exhausted the country's professional army, of which the 331st has been a showpiece. In footage of November's parade, 150 conscripts were shown before their dispatch to the front.\n\nThe total size of the 331st regiment could be estimated at 1,500-1,700. When it first sent into Ukraine in February 2022, it deployed two battalion groups, giving a total of 1,000-1,200 soldiers. After taking heavy casualties in the failed attempt to reach Kyiv, the regiment was withdrawn and rebuilt in the southern Russian garrison town of Belgorod last summer.\n\nSubsequent action has seen the regiment moving around all the major flashpoints - Izyum in the early summer, Kherson later on, and now back to Donbas. By monitoring the dates given in the death announcements on Kostroma social media, it's possible to work out when (and often where) the unit was used to spearhead assaults, and the lulls when it was removed from the line to lick its wounds. For example, a cluster of deaths in February point to elements of the 331st being engaged in Kreminna.\n\nMark Urban reports on how the Russian 331st Regiment, and their families, are coping with Vladimir Putin's long war\n\nEach time casualty replacements - including the conscripts shown on TV in November - are brought in to replace losses, the original cadre of soldiers gets smaller, and the overall size of the unit diminishes. It may now number no more than 300-400 at the front.\n\nThe losses, and indeed the return of badly wounded men, have resonated in the home community. A few weeks into the war, one user of V'Kontake exclaimed, \"Almost every day photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end?\"\n\nLocal media has been featuring commemorations of fallen Kostroma soldiers. In December, a TV station featured the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov, a paratrooper in the 331st who was killed in Ukraine. The style of this memorial and the language used in the report can be seen as an attempt to channel the Great Patriotic War (as the Russians call their 1941-45 fight against the Nazis), implying that today's soldiers are engaged in an equally important cause.\n\nLocal TV shows the unveiling of a plaque to Eduard Reunov\n\nBut on social media, we've found more modern manifestations of remembrance, and even people seeking revenge. Soldiers are shown holding shells with messages scribbled on them from Reunov's former classmates, and, supposedly, his family.\n\nThere's a trend seen in a few Russian garrison towns, for wives and mothers to post pictures of themselves with an absent soldier's uniform. One tearful mother of a dead paratrooper from the 331st remembers the Great Patriotic War, and adds, \"I hope there will be stories written about our guys\".\n\nThose questioning the sacrifice tend to get short shrift. \"Ukraine isn't my Motherland, our boys are dying for nothing,\" one person recently wrote on Kostroma's V'Kontakte page. Another swiftly countered, \"That's a stupid opinion. No point in writing that stuff here\".\n\nIt's evident from coverage of Gov Sitnikov's activities that the authorities are trying to mollify those who are anxious about the killed and wounded. It's not clear how much support the war has from the wider Russian public, but the video we've seen suggests there's a good deal of solidarity among military families in Kostroma.\n\nThe 331st's decline can also be measured in loss to machinery as well as personnel - particularly airborne infantry combat vehicles, known by the Russian initials BMD - that have been used up in successive battles.\n\nInitially, when the 331st was part of an Airborne Forces task force pushing towards Kyiv, we had difficulty identifying its vehicles in video of the fighting. A painted \"V\" was used to identify units from all of the various units in that task force, and an inverted triangle symbol with a \"3\" in the centre was also used by one other regiment apart from the 331st.\n\nAs the fighting wore on, soldiers in the 331st added a further ad hoc marking to the V on their vehicles' sides - an exclamation mark painted next to the V. They may have done this precisely so their commanders could distinguish their armour from the other regiments'.\n\nConsequently we were able to identify individual BMDs from the 331st being loaded up on railcars in March 2022, following their withdrawal from Ukraine. They then reappeared in Donbas during last summer's fighting.\n\nOpen source analysts have also identified at least 25 destroyed BMDs marked in this way, by combing Ukrainian military social media accounts. As with the dead soldiers, this visible loss does not represent the total, since many other BMDs belonging to the Kostroma regiment have likely been lost outside the view of Ukrainian troops.\n\nA report broadcast in February 2023 by the Russian network NTV shows an \"armoured group\" of the 331st in action in Luhansk. But it just tends to confirm the impression we've gleaned from other sources that the regiment survives as small detachments able to spearhead certain missions. From the call signs seen on camera this element consists of just three BMD armoured vehicles.\n\nSo, the regiment's long war goes on. Of the war's wider effects on the Ukrainian population you will glean little from Russian media, nor is there any frank coverage of war-crime allegations.\n\nThe 331st were accused of massacring hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during fighting in 2014. For many Ukrainians, the latest Russian losses may seem like nothing more than the paratroopers getting their just deserts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kostroma's graveyard there is plenty of evidence of the price of failure in Russia's invasion. Buried too is the regiment's reputation as \"the best of the best\", and its dreams of easy victory.\n\nTens of thousands of Harry Styles fans are in Cardiff\n\nPeople in Cardiff have woken up to a \"feather boa massacre\" following the first of two Harry Styles concerts in the city.\n\nAnd locals have more colour to look forward to as the star gears up to do it all over again in front of 60,000 at the Principality Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nStyles donned a Welsh flag during the first Cardiff show, and said it was a \"pleasure\" to be in Wales.\n\nSome fans spent days camping outside the stadium beforehand.\n\nStreets were littered with remnants of feather boas after Styles' first night in Cardiff\n\nExtravagant dress has become synonymous with Harry's style, so bright colours and feather boas are commonplace with fans.\n\nOn Twitter, one Cardiff resident described the scenes of loose feathers in the city centre on Wednesday morning as a \"feather boa massacre\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

about the values that we in Britain have, that we do not want to be part of a trade in endangered species' body parts.\n\n\"We are not telling other countries how to run their trade, or their conservation or hunting policies.\"\n\nSome MPs, including the Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson, also raised concerns Northern Ireland could become a \"back door\" for hunting imports as the

Sir Ranulph Fiennes, singer Ed Sheeran and actress Dame Judi Dench are among the celebrities who have backed the proposed legislation.\n\nAnimal charities welcomed the progress of the bill, with Born

Borders have been held up by great crested newts.\n\nThe presence of the protected species in a pond at Cavers Castle, near Hawick, has delayed a decision on a bid to bring it back into use.\n\nThe council's planning committee was being recommended to approve the application for the site.\n\nHowever, it deferred a decision to get a \"handle on the full population\" of newts in the pond.\n\nThe castle was demolished by explosives in the 1950s\n\nParts of Cavers Castle, also known as Cavers House, are believed to date back to the 15th or 16th Centuries.\n\nThe building was substantially extended in about 1750, followed by a \"massive redesign and remodel\" in the late 19th Century.\n\nWhen one of the last owners died in 1949, a buyer could not be found for the property so its contents were auctioned off and much of it demolished by explosives in 1953.\n\nThe planning committee met to discuss its fate last month but deferred a decision for a site visit.\n\nNow the discovery of the newts has put the decision on hold again.\n\nScottish Borders Council's principal planning officer Craig Miller told councillors: \"After the last committee we did receive an indication that there may be a European Protected Species within the pond at the south end of the site.\n\n\"The applicant was asked to carry out a pond survey and that was carried out and passed to the ecology officer confirming that the species was present in the pond.\n\n\"The survey did not contain enough detail or land searches to ascertain how many of the protected species were using the site and we

a pilot of payments for new childminders with more for those who sign through agencies.\n\nAkshata Murty was listed as a shareholder in one of those agencies, Koru Kids, as recently as 6 March.\n\nThe prime minister's press secretary said all Mr Sunak's interests \"have been declared in the usual way\".\n\nMinisters are expected to provide a written list of all financial interests that might \"give rise to a conflict\".\n\nMr Sunak mentions Ms Murthy's venture capital company, Catamaran Ventures, in his list of ministerial interests, but does not mention Koru Kids.\n\nThe PM also did not mention Ms Murthy's links to Koru Kids when he was questioned by MPs over the policy at a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\nLabour MP Catherine McKinnell asked Mr Sunak whether he had any interest to declare, and in reply he said: \"No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say there are \"are serious questions for Rishi Sunak to answer\" about \"any extra income his family could receive from his own government's policy\", and have urged the government's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate Mr Sunak over a potential breach of ministerial rules.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Sunak must explain why his wife's shareholding \"was not deemed necessary to publish in the register of members' interests\".\"He must urgently correct the record and set out what steps he took to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interest,\" Ms Rayner said.\n\nWhen asked about Ms Murty's shareholding - which was reported by the i newspaper - Mr Sunak's press secretary told reporters the details of Ms Murthy's holding in the agency were not in the public domain, but indicated they would be included in the updated statement of ministers' interests, due out in May.\n\n\"The ministerial code sets out a process by which ministers declare their interests. They do that in writing, in this case to the Cabinet Secretary. That process was followed to the letter by the prime minister,\" the press secretary said.\n\nDeclarations to the Cabinet Office are not immediately available to MPs or others to see.\n\nPressed that MPs are usually expected to draw attention to an interest they have declared if questioned about it in a committee, Mr Sunak's press secretary said \"there was not a specific interest that was put to him\".\n\nThe BBC has sought to ask both the company and Ms Murthy for comment.\n\nThe pilot of bonuses for childminders was announced in the Budget on 15 March as part of the government's overhaul of childcare.\n\nMr Hunt said the government would be \"piloting incentive payments of \u00a3600 for childminders who sign up to the profession, rising to \u00a31,200 for those who join through an agency\".\n\nThe pilot could drive up the number of childminders entering the profession and generate more business for companies such as Koru Kids.\n\nKoru Kids is listed as one of six childminder agencies on the government's website.\n\nOn its website, Koru Kids welcomed the government's reforms and said \"the new incentives open to childminders are great\".\n\nThe website says new childminders would get a bonus of \u00a31,200 if they \"come through an agency like Koru Kids who offer community, training and ongoing support\".\n\nMultiple burials in the same grave are among those found at the ancient cemetery in Garforth\n\nSkeletal remains of a high-status Roman woman encased in a lead coffin have been unearthed at a hidden cemetery dating back 1,600 years.\n\nDescribed as a \"once-in-a-lifetime find\", the female remains were discovered along with 60 other bodies at the site in Garforth, Leeds.\n\nThe skeletons are believed to include both late Roman and early Saxon men, women and children.\n\nIt is thought to be the first Anglo-Saxon cemetery found in West Yorkshire.\n\nA process known as carbon-14 dating will help determine a precise age of the remains\n\nSeveral archaeologists worked for weeks excavating the site and removing the lead coffin\n\nThe cemetery was discovered as part of a standard archaeological survey on the site, which had been earmarked for development.\n\nExperts said the fact the coffin had been made out of lead signified the skeleton was someone of importance.\n\nDavid Hunter, principal archaeologist for West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service, said: \"Lead coffins were expensive.

My main goal was to find answers for Martine's family, who regard her death as a test of international law. The UK has no extradition treaty with Yemen.\n\nBut it wasn't until last year that I finally managed to make contact with Farouk Abdulhak. My communication with him began over social media. Hundreds of journalists have reached out to him over the years and he has ignored them all. But our shared Yemeni background helped me gain his trust. Ten days after we first started texting, he sent me the first of what would turn out to be a series of revelatory messages.\n\n\"I did something when I was younger, it was a mistake,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring the thousands of texts and hundreds of voice notes he sent me over five months, not once did he use Martine's name or refer to her death, preferring the terms \"incident\" or \"accident\".\n\nBut the coroner's report made clear how violently the Norwegian student had died - the result of \"compression to the neck\" which \"could mean she was strangled, held down or smothered\". Her body showed 43 cuts and grazes, \"many of them typical of assault type injuries or those received in a struggle\".\n\nNawal Al-Maghafi on the phone to Farouk Abdulhak\n\nFarouk and Martine both studied at Regent's Business School in London, and Martine was hoping to become a financier in the capital. The last time her friends saw her alive was during the early hours of 14 March 2008, at the exclusive Maddox nightclub in Mayfair, where she and Farouk were celebrating the end of exams.\n\nThose friends say Farouk then offered to host an after-party at his apartment in Great Portland Street, central London. They were too tired to go, but say Martine wanted to continue partying. CCTV shows her leaving the club with Farouk at 02:59. There are no witnesses as to what happened next. By sunrise, she would be dead - though her body would not be discovered for at least another 48 hours. By this time, Farouk had fled the UK on a flight to Cairo. He then got on his father's private jet to Yemen. Farouk's lawyer insisted he was innocent of murder.\n\nFarouk isn't just any Yemeni. Brought up between the US and Egypt, he is the son of Shaher Abdulhak, one of the richest and most powerful men in Yemen. He forged an empire of sugar, soft drinks, oil and arms, and was a close friend of the president at the time, Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nWhen I first tried to speak to Farouk in 2011, I spent months in Yemen looking for him. But I had to leave when the authorities warned me to drop the story.\n\nIn February 2022 I decided to look into the case again - from London. By this time, Farouk's father had died and president Saleh had stepped down. I wondered if it would now be possible to get Farouk to talk.\n\nBut I also knew it wouldn't be easy. When a friend got hold of his number, I messaged him over several different apps but received no response. And then the friend noticed he was using Snapchat.\n\nNawal had been trying to make contact with Farouk Abdulhak for years\n\nI sent him a message and he responded within seconds. His first question was to ask where I was from. I gave him the name of the affluent Yemeni neighbourhood I grew up in, sensing that he was probably based there too. I was right. Immediately his interest was piqued.\n\nNow I had opened a dialogue with him, it was a matter of gaining his trust, especially as I never hid my profession - in our first few exchanges I told him I was a journalist.\n\nOur initial chats were simply about our similar experiences. Despite his incredible wealth, in some ways we had a lot in common. We exchanged stories of skiing in the same Swiss resorts, studying in international schools and the places we both liked going to in London.\n\nAnd then he started to open up.\n\n\"I did something when I was younger it was a mistake\u2026,\" he texted. \"I told you my real name, I can't specifically go to the UK for something that happened there.\n\n\"The only reason I am scared is you told me you're a writer and journalist.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: BBC reporter Nawal Al-Maghafi plays recordings of her phone conversations with Farouk Abdulhak for Martine\u2019s father\n\n\"You're the last person I should talk to.\"\n\nThe speed at which he began to take me into his trust might seem surprising, but bear in mind that Farouk is incredibly isolated. His entire family lives outside Yemen - including his now ex-wife and daughter - having fled the country's devastating civil war. But he dare not visit any of them for fear of arrest.\n\nNone of his friends who I spoke to during my investigation have heard from him since he fled - though all said they were shocked when they read about Martine's death at the time, saying his suspected involvement seemed completely out of character.\n\nMartine, Cecilie and Nina in Maddox night club on the night she died (far left to right)\n\nNow that Farouk seemed ready to share more, I made it explicit that I worked for the BBC and wanted to report on his story.\n\nAmazingly, this did not stop him talking.\n\nSo I asked him to elaborate on an earlier text exchange in which he'd talked about having \"major regrets\". He replied:\n\n\"1: I deeply regret the unfortunate accident that happened. 2 regret coming here [to Yemen] should have stayed and paid the piper.\"\n\nAt the same time, I was also interviewing other people connected with the case, including Martine's father and closest friends. This made the investigation one of the most difficult I've ever worked on. While I was speaking to those whose lives had been devastated by Martine's death and were desperate for answers, my phone was continually pinging with messages from Farouk.\n\nMartine's friends Nina Brantzeg and Cecilie Dahl were with her in Maddox nightclub the night she died. Cecilie had met Farouk with Martine before, and says they were friends. But that evening, he seemed different, she says - becoming upset when one of them took a photo of him and Martine, though Martine seemed unaware of anything unusual.\n\nAnother of Martine's friends, Thale Lassen, says she thinks Farouk had once tried to kiss Martine, and she had told him she wasn't interested. In fact, she says, Martine would often crash at his flat as it was so central. CCTV shows her linking arms with Farouk as they leave the club.\n\nWhen Martine didn't come home the next day, her friends reported her missing, but say it wasn't until someone noticed Farouk had deleted his Facebook account that police took matters seriously. They searched Farouk's apartment and quickly found her semi-naked body in the basement of his block.\n\nBy this time he had fled the UK. The police knew that Farouk had taken a commercial flight from London to Cairo, but didn't have detailed knowledge of his escape.\n\nMartine (right) and Farouk on the night she died\n\nI have managed to track down one of Farouk's father's closest friends in London - a man I am calling Samir. He told me he had received a call from Farouk in the early hours of 14 March asking for cash, saying he was urgently needed at home in Cairo and his credit cards weren't working. Samir says that while he was out getting the cash, Farouk passed out on his sofa, and it took pouring ice cold water on his face to revive him.\n\n\"It was as if he was on something,\" Samir tells me.\n\nHe says Farouk bought a ticket for the next flight to Cairo, and we know that from there his father transported him to Yemen - somewhere Farouk had never lived before, but from where it would be impossible to extradite him.\n\nI spoke about this further with another friend of Farouk's father - Jordanian businessman Abdulhay Al Mejali.\n\n\"His son wanted to go to England and sit in court and defend himself,\" he told me. \"But his father advised him not to get involved [and] stay in Yemen.\"\n\nJessica Wadsworth, the Met police's lead investigator on the case at the time, adm", "PPL": 1.6395206451416016, "PPL/lower": 0.9477471316502208, "PPL/zlib": 0.0004542866847164316, "Min-5%": 8.241261267194561, "Min-10%": 6.9540255280102, "Min-20%": 5.418173766077876, "Min-30%": 4.444561572727241, "Min-40%": 3.727466852565849, "Min-50%": 3.1570048614214827, "Min-60%": 2.6989831343196116}, {"text": "itals would form the new regional centres, saying accusations to the contrary were \"baseless\".\n\nEm: 'They push the drugs on you so early on'\n\nWhile Gids has helped some young people, critics - including young trans people seen by the clinic - claim it was sometimes too quick to refer young people for medical interventions and it could overlook mental health difficulties.\n\n\"They push the drugs on you so early on,\" Em, a 19-year-old trans man, who has identified as male since early childhood, told Newsnight.

However, his books and DVDs featuring false claims about terror attacks are still for sale on his website, along with videos about the Manchester Arena Attack.\n\nIn December, Mr Hall created a new \"True Crime\" section on his site listing various events and high-profile deaths, including the recent disappearance of 45-year-old Nicola Bulley.\n\nMr Hall's defiant response to the BBC investigation and the initial letter from Mr Hibbert's legal team suggests he is yet to change his mind on these conspiracy theories. He continues to defend the book he has written claiming the Manchester Arena attack was staged.\n\nHe also says he has received online death threats as a result of the investigation.\n\nBut terror attack survivors have also reported that incidents of trolling and conspiracy theories seem to have reduced since it was publicised.\n\nThe BBC approached Mr Hall again after the legal case was officially filed, but he did not respond to our request for comment.

He lives in an assisted living facility in Michigan and is under a legal guardianship.\n\nA lawyer for his guardian told the BBC they will not participate in the trial and \"have reached a settlement that gives Clarence a percentage of the estate without regard to the outcome of the will contest\".\n\nThe family rift had earlier driven Ms Owens to quit as representative of her aunt's estate.\n\n\"Given my aunt's love of family and desire for privacy, this is not what she would have wanted for us, nor is it what I want,\" she wrote in a 2020 court filing.\n\n\"I love my cousins, hold no animosity towards them, and wish them the best.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit\n\nEarlier this year, the court in Pontiac, Michigan, heard three voicemail messages, recorded in the months before Franklin died, in which she discusses another will she was preparing with an estate lawyer.\n\nIn the messages, Franklin is heard expressing certain \"firm intentions\" from a Detroit hospital bed, but attorney Henry Grix testified he believed she \"hadn't made up her mind\" about her final wishes.\n\nThe judge has excluded that document from consideration in the trial.\n\nThe Franklin fortune was estimated at $80m when the star died in 2018, but more recent valuations and several years of unpaid taxes have vastly reduced that number.\n\nAccording to an inventory filed in court, and seen by the BBC, the late singer's assets are valued at just under $6m.\n\nNicholas Papasifakis, who currently serves as Franklin's personal representative, said he is not participating in the trial and is not taking a side in the dispute.\n\n\"Once there has been a determination by the Court as to the disposition of Ms Franklin's Estate,\" he wrote in an email, \"I will follow that determination in distributing Ms Franklin's assets.\"\n\n\"I wanted to found a bank that was really good for customers, that was fair,\" says Anne Boden\n\nAnne Boden is stepping down as chief executive of Starling Bank, nine years after founding the company.\n\nThe Welsh businesswoman said it was the right time to step aside as it reported a record pre-tax profit of \u00a3195m, a six-fold increase on the previous year.\n\nShe will step down on 30 June, but will stay on the board and still part-own the company.\n\nStarling was one of a few so-called challenger banks which promised to revolutionise the UK sector.\n\nWith no branches, it prides itself on its app and customer service.\n\nMs Boden announced her departure as the bank published its latest profits for 2022-23.\n\nThe bank says it has begun a search across the globe for a new chief executive\n\nRevealing her intention to leave in an exclusive interview with BBC Wales, Ms Boden said: \"It's thrilling. When I look back at how I started Starling, I never thought we would get to this stage.\n\n\"Starling is bigger than just one person, it is bigger than a founder-led organisation. It is a piece of infrastructure that is important to the UK. We provide a real role in society.\"\n\nMs Boden, 63, said it was \"not really appropriate\" for Starling to continue to have a shareholder as its chief executive. She still owns 4.9% of the company and keeps a seat on the board as a non-executive director.\n\nStarling Bank said it has begun a global search for a new chief executive, with chief operating officer John Mountain taking the interim role.\n\nThe departing chief executive says she had become ashamed to be a banker before launching Starling\n\nStarling has grown steadily from its initial base of personal customers, adding business accounts and acquiring a mortgage book, partly due to its purchase of Fleet Mortgages.\n\nMs Boden, decided to pursue her dream of launching a bank after becoming disenchanted with the banking world.\n\n\"People never believed that a 5ft tall Welsh woman in her mid-50s could do something that had never been done before,\" she said.\n\n\"I had become ashamed to be a banker, I was ashamed to be part of that whole regime that had let the country down.\n\n\"I wanted to do something different, I wanted to found a bank that was really good for customers, that was fair. And people never believed I could do it and be profitable.\n\n\"So here we are, we have done it, proof positive.\"\n\nMs Boden said Starling Bank would continue to grow and believes it can take more customers from the older, more established banks.\n\nStarling will eventually list itself on the stock exchange, she said.\n\nThe bank has no branches and uses a mobile app for its services\n\nListing a firm on a stock exchange takes it from being a private to a public company, with investors able to buy and sell shares on specific exchanges. Companies usually list on stock exchanges to gain access to a wider range of investors.\n\n\"It's not going to be this year, but eventually Starling will list,\" she said.\n\n\"It will be at the right time.\"\n\nAs a result of her success with Starling, she has become a role model for women in finance. She chairs a UK government task force that aims to boost the number of women launching fast-growing businesses.\n\n\"When women get the investment, when", "PPL": 0.6028198003768921, "PPL/lower": 0.7298056016641375, "PPL/zlib": 0.00016606606070988762, "Min-5%": 4.860473151300468, "Min-10%": 3.6133557698305916, "Min-20%": 2.4677028199862736, "Min-30%": 1.8473490729005795, "Min-40%": 1.4585902417456609, "Min-50%": 1.1918419782046814, "Min-60%": 1.0012643258512044}, {"text": "\nMr Polak said his client was \"speechless\" and \"too tired to smile\" after being cleared of murder, adding: \"He said he hadn't slept for three or four days, but he is very pleased about what happened.\n\n\"He would like to thank everyone who supported him in this case.

It said there were exemptions to the ban under some circumstances.\n\nSome politicians are also reluctant to give up the TikTok habit, despite the security warnings.\n\nCabinet minister Grant Shapps - an enthusiastic TikTokker - reacted to the ban by posting a clip from the film, Wolf Of Wall Street, in which Leonardo DiCaprio, playing a New York stockbroker, uses a series of expletives and declares: \"The show goes on\".\n\nMr Shapps called the ban \"sensible\", but added: \"I've never used TikTok on government devices and can hereby confirm I will NOT be leaving TikTok anytime soon!\"\n\nMinisters have not been banned from using the site on their personal phones - just their work devices.\n\nBut Nadine Dorries - who experimented with TikTok videos when she was culture secretary - said she would be deleting the app from her personal phone, adding: \"I think all MPs should do likewise.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It is unclear when the message was recorded.\n\nAmong the issues Maj Gen Popov said he highlighted to his superiors were the lack of proper counter battery systems to help repel Ukrainian artillery attacks, as well as a lack of military intelligence.\n\nThe commander said his dismissal was demanded by senior commanders - who he accused of treason - and approved by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.\n\nRussian military bloggers - often the most insightful form of information in the absence of official comment from Moscow - reported that the order to dismiss Maj Gen Popov had come from the head of Russia's armed forces, Gen Valery Gerasimov.\n\nThey said Gen Gerasimov accused Maj Gen Popov of \"alarmism and blackmailing senior management\" after he highlighted the need to rotate soldiers who had been in the front line for a sustained period of time and had suffered significant losses.\n\n\"The senior chiefs apparently sensed some kind of danger from me and quickly concocted an order from the defence minister in just one day and got rid of me,\" Maj Gen Popov said.\n\n\"The Ukrainian army could not break through our ranks at the front but our senior chief hit us from the rear, viciously beheading the army at the most difficult and intense moment.\"\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has yet to comment on the dismissal.\n\nHowever, a senior official of the pro-government United Russia party, of which Mr Gurulyov is a member, criticised the MP for making a \"political show\" out of Maj Gen Popov's remarks.\n\n\"General Popov's statement was not public and was posted on closed chats of the commanders and troops of the 58th Army,\" Andrei Turchak wrote on telegram.\n\n\"Let the fact that...

Sinner was aiming to become the youngest since 2007.\n\nKnowledge of how to succeed on the biggest occasions in the sport, plus the ability to execute when it matters the most, proved to be the key.\n\nSinner was not able to convert any of his six break points in the match, including two in the opening game and another later in the pivotal first set.\n\nDjokovic converted his only opportunity in the first set and demonstrated his ability to clinically close out, hitting three aces and a service winner from 0-15 down at 5-3 in the opener.\n\nWith Sinner having not faced a seed in his run to the last four, Djokovic was a considerable step up in class.\n\nThings looked increasingly ominous for the Italian when he handed over a break for 2-1 in the second set.\n\nA fourth chance to take Djokovic's serve went begging in the fourth game - where the Serb was docked a point for hindrance, judged by British umpire Richard Haigh to have disturbed Sinner with a long grunt, and then warned for taking too long to serve.\n\nAfter his jaw dropped in disbelief and had words with the official, Djokovic quickly regained focus to hold.\n\nThe former world number one went on to serve out the second set without facing a further break point and few would have backed Sinner to turn the match around at that point.\n\nThe Italian refused to wilt like many expected and instead raised his level to push Djokovic in a tight third set.\n\nDjokovic was becoming increasingly tetchy as a result.\n\nHe had an exchange with a fan after saving two set points at 5-4, sarcastically telling them to stop crying, then smiling in the same direction after securing victory in the tie-break.\n\nAlcaraz underlines talent in 'one of best' performances on grass\n\nAlcaraz and Medvedev have both won major titles on the US Open hard courts, but were attempting to reach the SW19 showpiece for the first time after a summer of marked improvement at the All England Club.\n\nAlcaraz is playing in only his fourth professional tournament on grass courts and had won the Queen's title in the run-up.\n\nIt is testament to his outstanding talent he has become the youngest Wimbledon men's finalist since Spanish 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal in 2007.\n\nConfidence in his footwork has continued to build over the British grass-court season, providing the platform for the athletic Spaniard to use his hefty serve, booming groundstrokes and deft drop-shot to devastating effect.\n\nGrowing up in Murcia, clay courts are seen as his most natural surface but hard courts are where he won his first major at Flushing Meadows last year.\n\nNow he has emerged as a force on grass and underlined the fact again with a dominant win over Medvedev.\n\nThere was little between the pair until Alcaraz broke late in the first set.

For this city is home to a celebrated regiment that bears its name and has been in the forefront of all the main battles in the Kremlin's campaign against its neighbours.\n\nThe 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, often called the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, has been the subject of investigations by BBC's Newsnight since shortly after last February's invasion. These have revealed the price paid by the regiment and its home community. We had confirmed 39 fatalities by April last year, 62 by late July, and now the toll has reached 94.\n\nMuch of the work compiling this list has involved combing social media accounts on V'Kontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and local media reporting. We can then cross reference this with satellite and Google Street View imagery.\n\nOne video discovered on V'Kontakte showed soldiers' graves at a cemetery north-east of Kostroma. The graves shown in the videos match the names of the soldiers we have collated.\n\nThe actual number of 331st's dead is probably much higher. Some of the soldiers are from towns outside Kostroma, which makes tracking down information about them much more difficult. Several soldiers have been reported missing - some of these may count among the dead.\n\nWhen one considers those seriously wounded or taken prisoner, it's reasonable to assume that the Ukraine war has cost the regiment several hundred soldiers.\n\nThe loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies about 300km (186 miles) north-east of Moscow and has a population of around a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local authorities a difficult task of political management.\n\nSergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV.\n\nOn a visit to the", "PPL": 0.7116791605949402, "PPL/lower": 0.7270436923605273, "PPL/zlib": 0.00018842445342730744, "Min-5%": 5.925337085536882, "Min-10%": 4.515206259839675, "Min-20%": 3.0596416935069635, "Min-30%": 2.249727310594596, "Min-40%": 1.7468564673930334, "Min-50%": 1.415561625692094, "Min-60%": 1.1846511234174382}, {"text": "crowds around Buckingham Palace. In her bright red, blue and white wig, Heidi Roberts, from Surrey, said she was looking forward to having something to celebrate: \"I think we're all mourning the Queen, and I think it's a bit of a hangover from that.\"\n\nAs the procession began just after 10:20 BST, onlookers along the route erupted in cheers. This was the pageantry they had come for; that and a glimpse of the King and Queen.\n\nThe carriage reached Westminster Abbey and the ceremony began - broadcast to the world and piped to the crowds outside.\n\nThis time the TV pictures were in colour. And social media would curate it for you. On Twitter, Penny Mordaunt - the Conservative MP and leader of the House of Commons, who brandished the Sword of State as part of its presentation to the King - began trending. So too for a time was the republican slogan #NotMyKing.\n\nIn Majorca, British expats and tourists watched on big screens as they sat in the sunshine in novelty crowns. In New York, Iain Anderson, 43, organised a screening at Tea and Sympathy, a British-themed caf\u00e9 and shop.\n\n\"We haven't had the best history after that little war\", he joked, referring to the American Revolution. \"But people still like the history. The theatre of it, the pomp and the circumstance.\"\n\nAt the moment the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the crown on King Charles's head, the sound of popping corks could be heard along The Mall. Soon afterwards, as the carriage returned to Buckingham Palace, there were shouts of \"God Save the King\" and \"hip hip hooray\" from the crowd.\n\nThe appearance of the King and Queen on the palace's balcony - albeit with a scaled-back military flypast due to the weather - was imminent. The barriers were lowered. The crowd rushed to the front.\n\nCheryl Kingbrooks, Joanne Gerrard and her son Ryan were among them. \"We never thought we'd get right to the front,\" Cheryl said afterwards.\n\n\"We were right at the back of The Mall, and then as soon as the gates opened, we just ran down and we didn't realise we'd get that far forward. But we did and it was absolutely amazing,\" Ryan added.\n\nSoon after, the new King and Queen retreated inside. For some it had been a day to immerse themselves in, to be part of, come rain or shine. For others it was something to ignore or even endure. Either way, a new reign had begun.\n\nOne of Scotland's main police control rooms used a fake system to manipulate response time targets for eight years, according to documents seen by the BBC.\n\nThousands of calls to the Bilston Glen control room were allocated to a fictitious call sign known as DUMY.\n\nInternal systems would register that the calls had been passed to officers - but instead they were parked on a list.\n\nThis meant a police vehicle would not have been dispatched quickly to calls which had been judged as high priority.\n\nIt appears that many calls were not attended at all.\n\nThe practice, according to official police documents, was designed to \"provide artificial levels of incident management performance\".\n\nThe documents reveal that the DUMY call sign was used at Bilston Glen in Loanhead, Midlothian, from at least 2007 until the system was discovered in 2015 and stopped.\n\nPolice Scotland said the practice should not have been used after the creation of the national police force in 2013, and was \"permanently discontinued\" in March 2015.\n\nThe practice appears to have ended just four months before the M9 tragedy in July 2015. Lamara Bell and John Yuill died after their car lay undiscovered for three days after a crash, despite police being alerted.\n\nLamara Bell and John Yuill were found inside their car after it crashed down an embankment off the M9\n\nPolice Scotland was criminally prosecuted and admitted that failures in its call handling processes at Bilston Glen contributed to the death of Ms Bell.\n\nThe lawyer who acted for one of the bereaved families has told the BBC they were never told about the DUMY process.\n\nDavid Nellaney, of Digby Brown, said this was information which should have been disclosed to the families.\n\nHe added: \"I'm astonished to be perfectly honest. I think that puts the wider public at risk if calls are not being actioned\u2026 and to not respond to them and put them into a DUMY system whereby there's no guarantee that they'll come back to them, is quite shocking.\n\n\"I think it probably gives an indication of potentially the practices that were going on. When you adopt that type of practice you're bringing in factors such as human error, which have played a part in what happened with Lamara and John.\"\n\nMoi Ali said the system sounded like \"an attempt at deception\"\n\nMoi Ali, who was on the board of the Scottish Police Authority watchdog from 2013 to 2017, said this was the first time she had heard of the system.\n\n\"These are exactly the kind of things that should be flagged to the board so that we can start an internal investigation or inquiry,\" she said.\n\n\"So if that was concealed from us, I find that very, very concerning.\"\n\nTwo heavily-redacted documents were released to BBC Scotland after a lengthy Freedom of Information (FOI) process with Police Scotland.\n\nAn undated official misconduct document says an officer was being disciplined for conduct which \"discredits the Police Service or public confidence in it\".\n\nIt states that staff at Bilston Glen utilised a \"fictitious call sign known as 'DUMY', which had been introduced to prevent the activation of internal alarms and provide artificial levels of incident management performance.\"\n\nEach police car is given a four letter or number call-sign, which is used to allocate the calls which are received by the force.\n\nWhen a call was given to DUMY, the system would recognise that it had been allocated successfully - but instead, these calls were parked on a separate list.\n\nThis would help artificially inflate the centre's call-handling response times.\n\nThese internal targets were not published, but the then Chief Constable Stephen House was known to be target-driven, and staff have previously spoken about the pressure to meet them. Stephen House has been approached for comment.\n\nA report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) - the independent body which scrutinised Police Scotland - highlighted understaffing as one of the issues which contributed to the control room's problems around the time of the M9 crash.\n\nHowever, the HMICS investigation into the call-handling process at Bilston Glen makes no mention of the DUMY system.\n\nA HMICS spokesperson told the BBC its inquiry \"did not include a retrospective inspection of historical practices before this period\" and declined to say whether or not it knew about the practice.\n\nA second briefing document, dated 28 July 2015, reveals that the DUMY practice was in use at the Lothian and Borders force from at least 2007, and continued for two years after the country's regional forces merged into Police Scotland in 2013.\n\nIt states that being placed on the DUMY list would cause the incident \"to go to the bottom of the controller's incident list\".\n\nThe practice was halted briefly in January 2015, when the control system was being upgraded to a new system known as Storm Unity, and the DUMY call sign was no longer available.\n\nBut staff at Bilton Glen \"lobbied\" senior management to re-introduce it to the new system, and this was approved by a senior person whose name and title has been redacted on the documents.\n\nThe DUMY system was up and running for another six weeks before a member of the Glasgow control room noticed and raised the alarm.\n\nIn December last year, the BBC learned that Police Scotland chiefs had been so worried about the DUMY practice that they launched an internal investigation, led by then Ch Supt Paul Anderson.\n\nWe asked Police Scotland, under FOI, to provide a copy of his report. It told the BBC that it \"does not hold a copy of the report requested\".\n\nHowever, Mr Anderson, now a Deputy chief constable at Humberside Police, confirmed to the BBC that he did in fact carry out an investigation, and produced a report.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Anderson told the BBC he \"undertook a review on request of the chief officer team.

There was \"lots of love and laughter, but very little money\", he recalled.\n\nIt was a tough neighbourhood. Two of his uncles had been active members of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists before World War Two. When hostilities broke out, angry crowds attacked the family home in Howard Street. Serious injuries were only prevented when the sound of an air raid siren dispersed the mob.\n\nThe family scraped a living selling vegetables from barrows. Goodman's grandfather Albert pawned his gold watch every Monday morning to buy the week's supply.\n\nLen Goodman grew up in the post-war East End of London\n\nLen watched the old man attract customers with a smooth patter dotted with earthy phrases. He later used many of his grandad's lines on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nAlbert Goodman was good at his job. The barrow became two shops in Bethnal Green - with enough money left over to buy Len's parents a greengrocer business in Kent.\n\nSoon after they moved, the marriage fell apart. Goodman's father moved away, and his mother buried the shame of divorce by throwing herself into her job.\n\nAt school, young Len enjoyed football and cricket - but was no academic. \"It's obvious you're never going to amount to anything, Goodman,\" his headmaster declared. \"You're a failure in class. You'll be a failure in life.\"\n\nTo help his mother, he pushed a barrow of vegetables around town every evening - just as his grandfather had. This, Goodman believed, was a more valuable education than school had ever provided - as it taught him how to speak to people and engage them.\n\nAt the age of 14, he went to his first dance class. He had little love for the foxtrot, but a keen interest in girls. The most thrilling moment of the night, he later wrote, was the 'excuse me' dance - during which you had to kiss your partner goodbye.\n\nA year later, Goodman left school \"with no sense of loss on either side\". He began an apprenticeship in an engineering factory but, by his own admission, was dreadful at it.\n\nHe took a welding course and found work in the Harland and Wolff Royal docks in Woolwich. It wasn't a job he liked, but it brought in enough money to enjoy himself at weekends.\n\nGoodman became a sharp-dressed Mod, hanging out on his Vespa in Brighton on Saturday afternoons, trying to avoid fisticuffs with gangs of rival Rockers.\n\nLike many of his generation, he worshipped rock 'n' roll and regarded ballroom dancing as something 'old fogeys' did. Then, he broke his metatarsal playing football on Hackney Marshes, and was advised to find an activity to help build its strength again.\n\nWith his dance partner and first wife, Cherry\n\nJoy Tolhurst was a former world champion. At her first dance lesson, Goodman was hampered by wearing a winklepicker on one foot and a carpet slipper on the other. Slowly, he fell in love with the both the waltz and Mrs Tolhurst's daughter.\n\nHe and Cherry Tolhurst became partners on and off the floor. Their first competition was a Pontin's sponsored event at the Royal Albert Hall. Goodman practiced in his front room, with a lamp placed behind him - so he could see his hip action in the shadows.\n\nLen and Cherry toured the country teaching people how to dance\n\nAs the couple sashayed onto the hallowed stage, Goodman heard great bellows from the audience. Fifty-three fellow dock workers had hired a coach to come and support him, and were well lubricated up.\n\nWhen Joy's husband died suddenly, she asked 22-year-old Len to help her teach. Learning from an ex-welder was a shock to students used to a poised former professional.\n\nA \"10 from Len\" was reserved for the very best dancers\n\nBy 1973, Goodman and Cherry were driving thousands of miles a year, demonstrating the cha-cha-cha and rumba to amateur classes the length and breadth of the country.\n\nThey married and opened their own dance school in Dartford. The couple won a rising star competition in Blackpool - but decided not to compete professionally again.\n\n\"I got fed up with the politics of the business,\" explained Goodman. \"The fact that you had to placate and schmooze people that you didn't really like, because you did not upset them, as they were judges.\"\n\nThe decision took a toll on his marriage which, he admitted, had become more of a dance partnership than a relationship.\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, everything collapsed. Cherry left him for a multi-millionaire Frenchman, leaving Len in an empty house and with only half a business.\n\nHis heartstrings were healed when he met Lesley, a former wife of the manager of Black Sabbath. A year later, the couple had a son.\n\nWhat saved his business was the film Saturday Night Fever.\n\nGoodman put up posters: \"You've heard the music, now learn the dances.\" There were queues halfway down Dartford High Street and, when Grease came out, \"the seam of gold turned into a whole goldmine\".\n\nBy the time the BBC rang to suggest he audition for Strictly Come Dancing, Goodman was about to turn 60. He was settled with his new partner Sue, and their dance school was performing well.\n\nIn truth, he wasn't looking for new challenges. He was hoping to wind down his business and play a little golf. But his competitive instincts kicked in, so Goodman caught the bus to Strictly's studios, wearing his best tweed suit.\n\nRevel Horwood, Phillips and Tonioli all had backgrounds in theatre, but none knew ballroom. Len was concerned that the show might \"take the rise\" out of the discipline he loved - which could destroy his reputation.\n\nTo take part, he had to break a contract to judge the Blackpool championships - which clashed with the first TV show. It wasn't just the BBC that was taking a gigantic risk: Goodman knew he would never be asked again.\n\nGoodman with his fellow judges on ABC's Dancing with the Stars, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli\n\nHe decided the best thing was just to be himself. In the first show, he trotted out one of his grandad's favourite phrases, \"all sausage, and no sizzle\", and quickly settled in.\n\nThe audience loved his pithy observations. \"It's a lovely rise and fall, up and down like a bride's nightie,\" he told one nervous contestant. \"You're just like a trifle - fruity at the top but a little bit spongy down below,\" he informed another.\n\nAt heart, he was a teacher and was quick to offer practical advice. But one of the show's first brave celebrities, Jason Wood, discovered Goodman had a sharp tongue. \"Wood by name, wood by nature,\" he said.\n\nWith millions watching, the Americans picked up the show. ABC booked Tonioli to appear alongside two US judges on the rebranded Dancing with the Stars - only for history to repeat itself.\n\nDancing was never work for Len Goodman\n\nOne of ABC's picks did not perform well in the pilot programme. With 24 hour's notice, Goodman was put on a plane to Los Angeles.\n\nFor more than a decade, he crossed the Atlantic twice a week - appearing as head judge on both shows simultaneously. While in LA, he shared an apartment complex with Tonioli - with Bruno doing the cooking and Len the ironing.\n\nGoodman's natural charm worked so well on camera that he was offered other presenting opportunities. There was even a short-lived BBC game show, Partners in Rhyme.\n\nBut, in his 70s, he decided the constant flying back and forth had become too much.

Founded in 1856, the bank has been a pillar of the Swiss financial sector ever since. Although buffeted by the financial crisis of 2008, Credit Suisse did manage to weather that storm without a government bailout, unlike its rival-turned-rescuer UBS.\n\nMore recently, the marketing face of Credit Suisse has been Switzerland's tennis god Roger Federer. He smiles down from posters at Swiss airports, a symbol of strength, excellence, staying power and reliability.\n\nBut behind the glossy promotion were some big problems. Divisive management, costly exposure to finance company Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, a seedy money laundering case, and waning customer confidence in the last few months, which saw billions being withdrawn from the bank.\n\nAll it took to turn those doubts into a stampede was an apparently off the cuff remark from the Saudi National Bank, which owns almost 10% of Credit Suisse, suggesting it would not be increasing its investment.\n\nCredit Suisse's shares went into free fall, and even a statement of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, and an offer of $50bn (\u00a341bn) in financial support, couldn't stabilise the situation.\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAfter the financial crisis 15 years ago Switzerland introduced strict so-called \"too big to fail\" laws for its biggest banks. Never again, went the thinking, should the Swiss taxpayer have to bail out a Swiss bank, as happened with UBS.\n\nBut Credit Suisse is a \"too big to fail\" bank. In theory, it had the capital to prevent this week's catastrophe.\n\nAlso in theory Swiss financial regulators and the Swiss National Bank keep an eye on those systemically important banks and can intervene before disaster strikes.\n\nIt was odd, last week, to see the rest of the world reacting with real concern as Credit Suisse shares tumbled, and to hear, at first, nothing from Switzerland.\n\nRoger Federer went from winning prize money sponsored by Credit Suisse, to being its marketing figurehead\n\nEven the Swiss media seemed not to notice the headlines over at the Financial Times, and seemed more interested in the continued debate over how much support neutral Switzerland should be offering to Ukraine.\n\nBy the time people did notice, such damage had been done that Credit Suisse was beyond saving. The fallout had begun to threaten not just Switzerland's entire financial sector, but Europe's.\n\nAs the government met in emergency session to try to find a solution, you could almost smell the panic in Bern.\n\nAnnouncing the bank takeover, Swiss President Alain Berset said \"an uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system\".\n\nIt's hard to avoid the", "PPL": 0.7238684296607971, "PPL/lower": 0.7488782393793938, "PPL/zlib": 0.00019370308527182154, "Min-5%": 6.320063432057698, "Min-10%": 4.846774069701924, "Min-20%": 3.2205340538747738, "Min-30%": 2.333240419092318, "Min-40%": 1.7922995502361458, "Min-50%": 1.4434458019661618, "Min-60%": 1.2054300553465704}, {"text": "al fin of an adult male orca showing tooth rake marks from a fight\n\nThis has resulted in mature, five-tonne male orcas sticking close to - and being very dependent on - their mothers.\n\n\"These sons are really reliant on their mums for their survival,\" said Ms Grimes. \"Mothers will even directly feed their sons salmon that they catch.\n\n\"[So] it could also be that mum is present in a situation of conflict, and can signal to her sons to avoid the risky behaviour they might be participating in.\"\n\nAdult males can weigh up to five tonnes\n\nThe ongoing study of this threatened killer whale population, which lives in the coastal waters between Vancouver and Seattle, was started by Dr Ken Balcomb. Initially, he wanted to examine the threats to their survival, particularly as the population was targeted for capture and sale to some marine parks.\n\nAs well as garnering the southern resident killer whales official protected status, the ensuing years of work and observations went on to reveal insights into killer whale life that could only have come to light through decades of study.

That is why both candidates have their eye on the eight million who did not vote - but could this time.\n\nAhead of the run-off Mr Kilicdaroglu accused his rival of foul play, by blocking his text messages to voters while the president's messages went through. After voting in Ankara he urged Turks to protect the ballot boxes.\n\nOpposition parties are deploying an army of some 400,000 volunteers in a bid to ensure no vote-rigging takes place, both at polling stations and later at the election authority. But among the volunteers, they need lawyers such as Sena to accompany the ballot boxes.\n\nMy parents say we used to trust the results and we didn't need any volunteers. It's bad that we don't trust the state, but the state can only change if people force it to\n\nInternational observers spoke of an uneven playing field after the first round. But there was no suggestion that any irregularities in voting would have changed the result.\n\nAs he voted in Istanbul, President Erdogan said Turkish democracy was going through a second round in a presidential election for the first time and suggested Turks should make use of it.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu promised a very different style of presidency on his final day of campaigning: \"I have no interest in living in palaces. I will live like you, modestly... and solve your problems.\"\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu voted with his wife Selvi in Ankara\n\nIt was a swipe at Mr Erdogan's enormous palatial complex on the edge of Ankara which he moved to when he switched from prime minister to president in 2014. After surviving a failed coup in 2016 he took on extensive powers, detained tens of thousands of people and took control of the media.\n\nSo it was laden with symbolism when he paid a campaign visit on Saturday to the mausoleum of a prime minister executed by the military after a coup in 1960.\n\n\"The era of coups and juntas is over,\" he declared, linking Turkey's current stability to his own authoritarian rule.\n\nPresident Erdogan and his wife Emine voted at a school in Istanbul\n\nTurkey, however, is deeply polarised, with the president reliant on a support base of religious conservatives and nationalists, while his opposite number's supporters are mainly secular - but many of them are nationalist too.\n\nFor days the two men traded insults. Mr Kilicdaroglu accused the president of cowardice and hiding from a fair election; Mr Erdogan said his rival was on the side of \"terrorists\", referring to Kurdish militants.\n\nBut after days of inflammatory rhetoric about sending millions of Syrian refugees home, the opposition candidate returned to Turkey's number-one issue - the economic crisis, and in particular its effect on poorer households.\n\nA 59-year-old woman and her grandson joined him on stage to explain how her monthly salary of 5,000 lira (\u00a3200; $250) was now impossible to live on as her rent had shot up to 4,000 lira (\u00a3160; $200).\n\nIt may have been staged, but this is the story across Turkey, with inflation at almost 44% and salaries and state help failing to keep pace.\n\nEconomists say the Erdogan policy of cutting interest rates rather than raising them has only made matters worse.\n\nThe Turkish lira has hit record lows, demand for foreign currency has surged and the central bank's net foreign currency reserves are in negative territory for the first time since 2002.\n\n\"The central bank has no foreign currency to sell,\" says Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc University. \"There are already some sort of capital controls - we all know it's hard to buy dollars. If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter controls.\"\n\nEast of Ankara, gleaming tower blocks have been springing up in Kirikkale. It looks like boom-time for this city, run by the president's party.\n\nBut many people here are struggling.\n\nFatma has run a hairdresser's for 13 years but for the past two, work has dried up, and the cost of rent and hair products has soared.\n\nShe voted for an ultranationalist candidate who came third, and does not trust the two men left in the race.\n\nA few doors up the street, Binnaz is working a sewing machine at a shop for mending clothes.\n\nPeople cannot afford new dresses so she is earning much more, even if her monthly rent has trebled to to 4,000 lira. Despite Turkey's stricken economy, she is putting her faith in the president.\n\nI believe [Erdogan] can fix it because he's been in power for 21 years and he has all the power. It's his last term [in office] so he'll do all he can for us\n\nOutside a supermarket, Emrah Turgut says he is also sticking with Mr Erdogan because he has no faith in the other option, and believes the president's unfounded allegations that the biggest opposition party co-operates with terrorists.\n\nTurkey's second-biggest opposition party, the HDP, denies any link to the militant PKK, but President Erdogan has used their backing for the rival candidate to suggest a link to terrorists.\n\nWhoever wins on Sunday, Turkey's parliament is already firmly in the grip of Mr Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party and its far-right nationalist ally, the MHP.\n\nThe AKP also has the youngest MP, who arrived in parliament on the eve of the presidential vote.\n\nZehranur Aydemir, 24, believes that, if Mr Erdogan wins, then he will lay the foundations for a century in which Turkey will become a global power: \"Now Turkey has", "PPL": 0.43100956082344055, "PPL/lower": 0.6779548662028486, "PPL/zlib": 0.00011899767002303715, "Min-5%": 4.800829380166297, "Min-10%": 3.342426410492729, "Min-20%": 2.0120903718442382, "Min-30%": 1.401895719189015, "Min-40%": 1.0685281427599909, "Min-50%": 0.8596184788197133, "Min-60%": 0.7177525221492264}, {"text": "the detained Americans would be a complex prisoner swap for Krasikov needing the cooperation of Germany, the US and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, German politician Roderich Kiesewetter said the deal would force Berlin into \"hostage diplomacy\". So why does Putin seem so desperate to get Krasikov back?\n\nThe first clues of a possible Kremlin hand in the Berlin murder come from Krasikov's background - or rather, the lack of one.\n\nDocuments obtained by the Bellingcat investigative website show he was wanted over the 2013 Moscow murder. However, two years later, the arrest warrant was withdrawn and the \"Vadim Krasikov\" identity seemingly vanished into thin air.\n\nThat is when \"Vadim Sokolov\", age 45, appeared. In 2015 he got a passport, and, in 2019, a tax identification number.\n\nA German court concluded that this documentation could only be sanctioned by the Kremlin, and therefore that Vadim Krasikov had state support for the Berlin murder.\n\n\"Russian state authorities ordered the accused to liquidate the victim,\" a German presiding judge said after sentencing Krasikov to life in prison.\n\nGermany expelled two Russian diplomats in response to the murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili\n\nHis victim, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was a Chechen rebel commander between 2000 and 2004, when Chechnya was fighting a war of independence against Russia.\n\nTo Western observers, Mr Khangoshvili seemed likely to be part of a string of Moscow-ordered assassinations of Chechen exiles in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe Kremlin denied orchestrating the Berlin murder, and dismissed the verdict against Krasikov as \"politically motivated\".\n\nHowever, in his Tucker Carlson interview, President Putin appeared to make an admission when he said negotiations were under way for an exchange involving a Russian \"patriot\" who had \"eliminated a bandit\" in a European capital.\n\nUlrich Lechte, who sits on the German government's foreign affairs committee, told the BBC that President Putin's desire to retrieve Krasikov is \"a clear admission of guilt and shows how unscrupulously and unchallenged Russia has been able to act in our country\".\n\nVadim Krasikov belonged to the highly secretive 'Vympel' unit of Russia's secret service, the FSB, according to prosecutors at his trial.\n\n\"Its official remit is counter-terrorism operations at home, but it has in many ways returned to its original roots, as a unit tasked with covert 'wet-work' - sabotage and assassination - abroad,\" Putin historian and Russian security expert Mark Galeotti told the BBC.\n\nKrasikov personally met Putin at a target shooting range while serving with Vympel, owned a BMW and Porsche, and travelled for work regularly, according to an interview his brother-in-law gave The Insider.\n\nAn association between Krasikov and the FSB would provide one explanation for why Vladimir Putin, a former foreign intelligence officer himself, would be willing to hand over a prisoner of the value of Evan Gershkovich.\n\nBut Mark Galeotti said a potential deal says more about Russia's social contract with agents abroad than the value of Krasikov individually.\n\n\"It [Russia] says 'look, if you do get caught, we will get you back, one way or the other. It may take a long time, but we will get you back',\" Mr Galeotti said. \"That's very important for getting people to put themselves in potentially very dangerous situations.\"\n\nBut whether Krasikov will ever be allowed back to Russia is ultimately up to the German government.\n\nThe BBC approached three members of the government's foreign affairs committee, all of whom oppose releasing Krasikov.\n\nUlrich Lechte, whose Free Democratic Party is part of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government, insisted that Germany \"must not do Russia this favour\".\n\n\"This is a kind of amnesty and sends the political signal that Russia can commit further murders on our territory, which will then be released and thus remain unpunished,\" Mr Lechte told the BBC.\n\nPoliticians on Germany's foreign affairs committee say Zelimkhan Khangoshvili's murder was \"state terrorism\"\n\n\"It must not be allowed to prevail that foreign citizens are arbitrarily arrested in order to abuse them for a prisoner exchange.\"\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Hardt, from the Christian Democrats, said he \"didn't see any political support\" for rumoured prisoner swaps involving Krasikov.\n\nEven if there was political will in Berlin to release Krasikov, the legal mechanics which could make that happen are murky.\n\nHe could be pardoned by the president, or deported to serve the remainder of his sentence in Russia - something that almost certainly wouldn't happen in light of Putin's comments.\n\nOne case in point is the Russian \"Merchant of Death\", Viktor Bout, an infamous arms dealer released from US custody as part of a prisoner exchange with US basketball star Brittney Griner. Bout has now pivoted to politics and won a seat at a local election in Russia.\n\nA protest against the Putin regime was held in Berlin during the Russian election.\n\nNicola Bier, a German lawyer focusing on extradition law, told the BBC there is \"no legal mechanism that is really designed for this particular situation\", so any move would be highly controversial and political.\n\nAnti-Kremlin political activist Bill Browder is now compiling a list of more than 50 Russian prisoners in Western countries who could be used as bargaining chips to free activists and journalists detained in Russia.\n\nBrowder hopes the effort could help release British-Russian journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza, sentenced to 25 years in jail for treason for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, as well as Evan Gershkovich.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether his campaign played into \"hostage diplomacy\", Browder conceded it is \"far from ideal\", but necessary to save lives.\n\nAfter Alexei Navalny's death, Browder said, \"it's clear that other hostages are at risk of dying\".\n\nBrian Harman overcame an early wobble to stroll serenely to his first major title with a six-shot victory at the 151st Open Championship in Hoylake.\n\nA one-under 70 proved more than enough for the American, who finished on 13 under at a rain-soaked Royal Liverpool.\n\nWorld number three Jon Rahm finished joint second on seven under with Sepp Straka, Tom Kim and Jason Day.\n\nRory McIlroy ended six under, while Matthew Jordan and Tommy Fleetwood were England's best, tied on four under.\n\nIt has been a fairytale week for Jordan, who was on the Royal Liverpool chipping green at the age of three and became a member aged seven.\n\nThe R&A gave him the honour of hitting the opening tee shot on Thursday and he birdied the last to card a one-under-par final round on Sunday that lifted him into the top 10 and qualifies him for next year's Open at Royal Troon in Ayrshire.\n\n\"Normally I just see players on TV and think 'that'd be cool if it happened to me',\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was just the perfect finish to what has been the most unbelievable week.\"\n\nIt has also been a fairytale week for Harman.

Is the evidence against the tabloid stacking up?\n\nAt times during the hacking court case it seemed as though we had travelled back in time, to the days before social media, when people got their news from pages of ink, printed on actual paper.\n\nBack to the 1990s and 2000s, when stories about Prince Harry - barely out of school and falling for his first girlfriends - could fill newspapers day after day.\n\nThe tabloids were also fascinated by soap stars. Two Coronation Street actors were claimants in this trial. Michael Turner played mechanic Kevin, and Nikki Sanderson, hairdresser Candice.\n\nThe fourth claimant was Fiona Wightman, dragged into the red-tops by her marriage to Paul Whitehouse, whose TV comedy sketches on The Fast Show had catapulted him to fame in the 90s.\n\nActors Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell (left), and Nikki Sanderson (right) were also claimants\n\nWhat became clear during the trial was Mirror journalists didn't just make up their stories as many critics of the tabloids might believe. They pursued accurate reporting of celebrity secrets as vigorously as another journalist might investigate a corrupt politician.\n\nBut their most precious commodity was sensitive personal information, some of it obtained illicitly from phone hacking. This is no longer disputed by the newspapers, because this trial was not the first.\n\nIn 2015, the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People (now known as Reach PLC) admitted journalists used phone hacking and other unlawful methods during a previous landmark case, brought by another Coronation Street actor, Shobna Gulati and others.\n\nThe High Court judge, Mr Justice Mann, ruled that for seven years, from 1999, there had been \"widespread, institutionalised and long-standing\" phone hacking at the newspapers and editors knew - in particular, the editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver. The publisher apologised.\n\nTina Weaver, who led the Sunday Mirror for 11 years, gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into press ethics in 2012\n\nIn the latest trial, which concluded on Friday, the claimants were trying to expand the legal action to more potential victims, and prove the scandal reached the top of Mirror Group - to its board and its lawyers. If Mr Justice Fancourt finds they knew - and did nothing - the company could be hit with massive bills for compensation.\n\nDuring this trial, the claimants attempted to make a new case against Piers Morgan, the television presenter who was Mirror editor between 1995 and 2004, who had emerged largely unscathed from the 2015 trial.\n\nThey brought together a series of incidents, which they said suggested he knew quite a lot about phone hacking and blagging - the reckless obtaining of personal information such as addresses, phone bills or bank statements - in the hope of creating an unbreakable thread of evidence.\n\nThere was the lunch where Mr Morgan urged a phone company executive to tell his customers they should change the PIN numbers on their mobiles, because journalists could listen to their voicemail messages.\n\nThere was the former intern who told the court he overheard a journalist reassuring Mr Morgan that a story about the singer Kylie Minogue was accurate because it had come from her voicemails.\n\nA former Guardian journalist who said in a statement that Mr Morgan had explained to him most people didn't change the default access code for their voicemails, so they were easy to guess.\n\nAnd the agent for TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, who couldn't work out why Mr Morgan seemed to know so much about her client.\n\nBut neither side called Mr Morgan to the witness box to defend himself. In civil trials, witnesses only tend to be called if they can help one side or the other. The Mirror Group argued Mr Morgan's appearance would have been an \"unnecessary distraction\" from the issues the judge has to decide.\n\nRemember, a key question was what executives knew. Piers Morgan was not on the board of Mirror Group Newspapers, the company said, and only attended two meetings over nine years.\n\nBut towards the end of the hearings, the judge put Mr Morgan at the top of a list of 29 journalists who hadn't come to court and perhaps \"could and should\" have given evidence.\n\nAfter all, Mr Justice Fancourt pointed out, the former editor had been happy to talk about phone hacking outside court.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March 2023)\n\nMr Morgan recently told the BBC: \"I never hacked a phone. I wouldn't even know how. I never told anybody to hack a phone.\"\n\nHe also insisted he didn't know phone hacking was going on, but also that he couldn't be sure stories hadn't been published which used unlawful methods.\n\nBut will the judge \"draw an inference\" that Mr Morgan not giving evidence suggests he was involved? He could decide he doesn't have to make any ruling at all about the former editor.\n\nSo what else did we learn? The trial lifted the lid on a network of private investigators, or PIs, who specialised in feeding personal information to the tabloids.\n\nFor the first time, a handful appeared in court. Ageing veterans of the information trade, sometimes scoffing at the questions they faced, sometimes confused by them.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2011 the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People spent at least \u00a39m in payments to PIs. We heard that reporters on the Mirror papers regularly subcontracted the process of obtaining information to these PIs.\n\nA reporter might get one to find an address and phone number from credit reference agencies, or from the Electoral Roll, potentially breaching data protection laws.\n\nIt was claimed journalists might use these details to hack a celebrity's phone themselves, or pass them onto another specialist investigator, who would in turn know the right \"blagger\" able to get more information.\n\nThere were people who would pose as bank customers to get financial records, or NHS staff to obtain someone's medical status. Some were experts at digging through credit records, others at digging through rubbish. Literally, the contents of celebrity bins.\n\nThe information would then be passed back up the chain, and presented to the reporter. The claimants argued this would allow the journalist to say it had been provided by \"sources\", and to deny knowing it had potentially been obtained unlawfully.\n\nQuotes lifted from phone hacking would be written up as the words of anonymous \"insiders\" to disguise their source, the court heard.\n\nMirror Group's barrister, Andrew Green KC, accepted there were some investigators who broke the law - \"rotters\" as he called them several times. But most of the time they were using legitimate databases, he said.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex gave evidence in the hacking trial in June\n\nThe three alleged victims of \"unlawful information gathering\" were chosen as test cases. Prince Harry picked himself as the fourth by simply refusing to settle with the Mirror.\n\nTheir time in the witness box was mainly spent defending their cases against Mr Green. He tried to get them to accept that the stories the newspapers published about them must have come from publicly available sources, from friends, \"insiders\", other newspapers or even interviews they had willingly given.\n\nHe argued the four cases had been \"wildly overstated\" and, in the case of Prince Harry, it was \"entirely speculative\". Unlike the 2015 case, Mr Green added, there was very little evidence phones were hacked or that information was unlawfully obtained.\n\nPrince Harry's approach in the witness box was to suppress his anger and suggest it was for the journalists to explain how they got their stories about him.\n\nPrince Harry's lawyer says newspaper coverage of his client and ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy meant \"they were never alone\"\n\nAt the time, he didn't read all 33 articles in", "PPL": 0.10866022855043411, "PPL/lower": 0.3097471318484859, "PPL/zlib": 2.9479172151501388e-05, "Min-5%": 1.6923455744981766, "Min-10%": 0.9547090344130993, "Min-20%": 0.5153633742650156, "Min-30%": 0.35376887970243004, "Min-40%": 0.26891524988648474, "Min-50%": 0.21647748546820367, "Min-60%": 0.180996372489788}, {"text": "-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.\n\nThey may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda.

The impact of the 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan\n\nWhen disasters happen, particularly when big earthquakes strike, the world's media is drawn like flies to the most dramatic destruction. It is understandable. But it often portrays a distorted picture of what has happened.\n\nYou can see it here in the city of Hualien. Camera teams are crowded around a 10-storey building leaning over at a terrifying angle. It all looks bizarre and scary. But that was only one of a handful of buildings which suffered structurally, in a city of tens of thousands.\n\nA hundred metres away beyond the police cordon, the streets of Hualien look entirely normal. Shops and caf\u00e9s are open, traffic is flowing. Drive through the city and if you didn't know a big quake had struck days ago, you wouldn't guess it.\n\nThe fact that this city has survived largely unscathed has sparked immediate discussion of how and why.\n\nJust over a year ago, we saw earthquakes of about the same magnitudes striking Turkey and Syria, causing the deaths of more than 50,000 people. These countries, of course, had far fewer resources. But when a much smaller 6.7 magnitude quake hit the city of Christchurch in New Zealand in 2011, almost the entire city centre was flattened.\n\nTaiwan is also often on the fault lines, but it has made significant progress in coping with shakes. Many say the wake-up call was Taiwan's 1999 Chi Chi earthquake - the worst in its history. It caused the deaths of more than 2,400 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings.\n\nI witnessed the aftermath of that disaster. In the central county of Nantou many apartment buildings had been toppled. What was most striking was how many of them were brand new.\n\nI remember a huge 20-storey building that had snapped off at its foundations and was lying flat on its side - still almost completely intact.\n\nThe catastrophic damage prompted a lot of anger and soul-searching about why so many brand new buildings had failed. Experts said their design was fundamentally flawed. The base pillars were not big enough, the amount of steel in them too small.\n\nTheir findings won't have been entirely a surprise: when I lived in Taipei in the 1990s, there were repeated construction scandals.\n\nThe loss of life in the 1999 earthquake triggered a public outcry and demands for stronger action\n\nA building I lived in as a student was condemned after it was found to have been built with concrete made with sea sand. Sea sand is much cheaper than river sand, but has a much higher saline content. That corrodes the steel reinforcement bars, causing concrete cancer.\n\nWe were told even a medium-level quake could have brought the building down. Another investigation by the Taipei city mayor found old oil cans had been placed inside the concrete pillars of a new building.\n\nThe construction company was accused of using this trick to skimp on concrete and increase its profit.\n\nA lot has changed since then. Following the Chi Chi quake, building codes were changed.\n\nAll new buildings are now required to meet a basic earthquake resistance level that means they can withstand a certain level of shaking without major structural failures.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. BBC Asia Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports on the hundreds of landslides unleashed by the quake\n\nThe government is also constantly revising the quake resistance levels required of buildings - identifying those that need upgrading. After 1999, they carried out a sweep of seismic retrofitting - that typically involved adding a framework of steel beams to a building's exterior, or adding reinforcements like extra pillars. That applied to infrastructure like bridges too.\n\nProf Yih-Min Wu at the National Taiwan University, who has worked in the country's response and prevention departments for decades, says: \"Taiwan is hit so frequently by dangerous earthquakes [that] most of the poor quality buildings are already gone.\"\n\nAnd corrupt construction practices are prosecuted. Following the Tainan earthquake in the island's south-west in 2016, when a 17-storey high-rise collapsed killing dozens, five people involved in the building's construction were prosecuted and jailed.\n\nOf the 10 deaths reported so far this week, only one tragic loss of life occurred due to a collapse of a building - that 10-storey building in Hualien I mentioned earlier. The others were associated with landslides and rockfalls.\n\nAnd that points to another main reason for why Taiwan this time saw limited damage.\n\nLuck played a part. Wednesday's quake began offshore before hitting south of the nearest major population centre, Hualien.\n\nSeismology maps show how the epicentre was 30km (18 miles) to the south of the city, so Hualien and its environs were spared the worst shaking.\n\nThis instead happened in the mountains to the south, west and north, where it unleashed huge rock slides, damaging roads and bridges, and tragically, causing deaths.\n\nWednesday's event contrasts with Nantou in 1999, and Turkey and Syria last year, where earthquakes struck very close to densely populated areas.\n\nStill, the 7.4 earthquake was an incredibly powerful event, shaking not only the island but lands beyond that too.\n\nFortunately for Taiwan, this time it was well-prepared.\n\nWith additional reporting by Frances Mao in Singapore\n\nSage Tod", "PPL": 0.4910346269607544, "PPL/lower": 0.7247497987366707, "PPL/zlib": 0.00013246145858126636, "Min-5%": 5.08322239857094, "Min-10%": 3.6248318506222144, "Min-20%": 2.245720579892324, "Min-30%": 1.5880150466623446, "Min-40%": 1.216111467659364, "Min-50%": 0.979268481314022, "Min-60%": 0.8177725147647049}, {"text": "recession\" but said more interest rate rises were likely as the Bank of England fights to get inflation under control.\n\nThe Bank has raised rates steadily since December 2021, most recently from 4% to 4.25% in March.\n\nAlex Belfield was jailed for five and a half years for stalking four people, including Jeremy Vine\n\nA former BBC radio presenter convicted of stalking Jeremy Vine has agreed to pay damages to the broadcaster.\n\nAlex Belfield was jailed in September for five and a half years for harassing four people online.\n\nThis included the BBC Radio 2 presenter, who launched separate civil action over Belfield's \"campaign of harassment\", the High Court was told.\n\nVine's lawyer said Belfield made false allegations in nine YouTube videos and eight tweets, published in 2020.\n\nGervase de Wilde told Mrs Justice Steyn that Belfield - a former BBC Radio Leeds presenter - posted \"entirely false\" allegations between May and August of that year.\n\nThis included the false claim that Vine was \"seriously and demonstrably dishonest\", because he had \"publicly and repeatedly lied\" about his knowledge of the circumstances in which the BBC donated \u00a31,000 towards a memorial fund for radio executive John Myers.\n\nMr Myers, who died in June 2019, was one of Vine's \"closest friends\", the court was told.\n\nMr de Wilde said Belfield also sought to obtain \"private information concerning [Vine]\", including the phone numbers of family and friends, \"for the purposes of publishing and disclosing that information online\".\n\nThe court heard Belfield also encouraged members of the public to contact Vine during his broadcasting work and during \"his day-to-day life\".\n\n\"[Vine] was also made deeply upset and anxious by the defendant's harassment of him, and he became concerned for the safety of his family,\" Mr de Wilde said.\n\nVine allowed Belfield to cross-examine him during the criminal trial\n\nGiving evidence during Belfield's separate criminal trial, Vine said \"the saddest thing\" was when one of Belfield's followers called him a \"thieving toe-rag\" under a Facebook tribute to his late father, who died with Parkinson's disease in 2018.\n\nVine described the harassment as \"like an avalanche of hatred you get hit by\", and \"absolutely Olympic-level stalking, even for broadcasting\".\n\nBelfield was convicted of stalking BBC Radio Northampton presenter Bernard Spedding, known as Bernie Keith, and videographer Ben Hewis.\n\nIn relation to Vine and theatre blogger Philip Dehany, Belfield was found guilty of two lesser offences of \"simple\" stalking, which does not require serious alarm or distress to be proved.\n\nBelfield was found not guilty of stalking Rozina Breen, Liz Green, Helen Thomas and Stephanie Hirst.\n\nMr de Wilde said following Belfield's criminal conviction, Belfield accepted \"the defamatory and seriously harmful allegations of dishonesty which he made against [Vine] are entirely false\".\n\nBelfield, he said, had \"agreed to pay [Vine] substantial damages, as well as his legal costs, and to give undertakings subject to a penal notice in respect of future publications and conduct concerning [Vine]\".\n\nThe exact amount has not been disclosed.\n\nAlan Robertshaw, representing Belfield, originally from Mapperley in Nottingham, added: \"He wishes to apologise unreservedly for the damage and distress caused to [Vine] and his reputation by his publications and express his profound and unreserved regret for all of the harm for which he is responsible.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Talks over a bout at Wembley Stadium on 29 April have broken down, despite a late bid to salvage the situation. Usyk had agreed a 70/30 purse split in Fury's favour with terms for a rematch the only outstanding issue. But Warren said the fight is now a \"dead duck\" and suggested Usyk had looked \"for a way to get out\". \"They said the fight must take place before 29 April and if it goes later they want different splits,\" Warren said. \"The reason they did that was they didn't think Tyson would be ready for the 29th and suddenly Tyson was ready for it. \"He has been in training camp for two and a half weeks, got trainers in from America and they looked for a way to get out.\" Fury currently holds the WBC heavyweight belt while Ukraine's Usyk, who beat Britain's Anthony Joshua for a second time last year, has the others in the division. Warren said Fury had agreed to the principle of a rematch but terms around the deal, and whether it would again be for all of the belts, had not been finalised. He said Usyk's camp have also been \"turned\" by potential earnings by fighting in Saudi Arabia later this year by which time Usyk would have to fight other mandatory challengers. \"There is an established rota of who Usyk has to defend against,\" Warren said. \"That's why after the 29th it goes away.\" Both parties have until 1 April to agree a deal after the WBA said it would wait until that date before ordering Usyk to fight mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois. A breakthrough in talks, followed by another obstacle When Fury, 34, beat Derek Chisora in December to retain his WBC title, he said agreeing a deal with Usyk and his team for an undisputed fight would be easy - but that has not proven to be the case. After months of back and forth, Fury publicly declared 12 days ago he would not accept anything less than a 70/30 purse split in his favour. Usyk surprised everyone by accepting that offer, despite holding three of the four world titles, and subsequently informed governing body the WBA that terms had been reached.\n\u2022 None Are Prince Naseem Hamed's sons coming for his crown?\n\u2022 None Is Ricky Gorman the next Tyson Fury? However, Fury then said he would not sign any deal that included a rematch clause - leading to a conference call on Sunday morning between all parties. Warren said \"six or seven\" outstanding issues were ironed out and he had managed to convince Fury to accept a rematch. The WBC champion agreed and the call ended with Team Fury optimistically preparing an official statement to announce the fight. Warren teased on Twitter on Sunday that news was imminent, but the two sides again clashed over the proposed terms of a rematch. According to Warren, Fury was against an immediate rematch in part as he did not want to be tied into two fights against Usyk as he was with Deontay Wilder, which meant he could not fight British rival Anthony Joshua. The purse splits for a proposed rematch appear, however, to be the key unresolved issue to unlocking Fury v Usyk. 'Why are we even talking about rematches?' Usyk, the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and Ring magazine champion, would like a proposed rematch to happen in November or December, but there are fears among Team Fury that the four belts would have fractured by then. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman contacted the Fury camp on Wednesday to say the governing body could not guarantee its support for an immediate rematch. Usyk, 36, wants a rematch clause like the one Joshua activated when they fought in 2021. The Briton was given the chance to immediately regain the titles and Usyk would want the same opportunity if he was beaten by Fury. But if the Ukrainian overcame Fury in their first fight, he would also expect an improved purse split in a rematch. There has not been an undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999 when Lennox Lewis beat Evander Holyfield - and never been one in the four-belt era.\n\u2022 None Enter the world of the social media personality\u2019s multi-level marketing scheme and webcam business\n\u2022 None The rise and fall of the jeweller-", "PPL": 0.8627302646636963, "PPL/lower": 0.7486353664359727, "PPL/zlib": 0.00023405595894294528, "Min-5%": 6.434752749461754, "Min-10%": 4.9577735498839735, "Min-20%": 3.4813749944668237, "Min-30%": 2.642810396437536, "Min-40%": 2.095495882379266, "Min-50%": 1.7106162590935128, "Min-60%": 1.4355168814955928}, {"text": "\u2022 None First images of Titan sub as it is brought ashore\n\nNew evidence of China's spy balloon programme - including flights over Japan and Taiwan - has been uncovered by BBC Panorama.\n\nJapan has confirmed balloons have flown over its territory and said it's prepared to shoot them down in future.\n\nChina has not directly addressed the evidence presented by the BBC.\n\nUS-China relations were thrown into turmoil earlier this year, when an alleged Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the US coast.\n\nChina claimed the balloon seen over north-western US in late January was a civilian airship, used for scientific research such as meteorology - and that it was an unintended and isolated event.\n\nJohn Culver - a former East Asia analyst for the CIA - told Panorama that this \"had been not just a one-off, but a continuing effort dating back at least five years.\" He said the Chinese balloons were \"specially designed for these long-range missions\" and some had \"apparently circumnavigated the globe\".\n\nFebruary 2023: US Navy personnel recover the debris from a suspected spy balloon in the North Atlantic\n\nWorking with Synthetaic, an artificial intelligence company which sifted through huge amounts of data captured by satellites, the BBC has found multiple images of balloons crossing East Asia.\n\nThe company's founder, Corey Jaskolski, found evidence of one balloon crossing northern Japan in early September 2021. These images have not been published before.\n\nMr Jaskolski also believes the evidence points to this balloon having been launched from deep inside China, south of Mongolia. The BBC has been unable to confirm this.\n\nJapan is a close ally of the US and more American forces are stationed there than in any other foreign country.\n\nYuko Murakami, from the Japanese ministry of defence, told the BBC that the government was \"taking all precautions to monitor the situation on a daily basis\" and would even be willing to shoot down balloons to protect the \"lives and property of people in the territory of Japan\".\n\nThe US State Department says it believes the Chinese balloons are equipped to gather signals intelligence. It says the aircraft it discovered over the US had \"multiple antennas, likely capable of collecting and geo-locating communications\".\n\nTo investigate whether China had launched other balloons, the Panorama team first searched social media and press reports across the region for sightings of UFOs in the sky.\n\nThey found two photographs taken by Taiwan's weather service, appearing to show a balloon over the capital, Taipei, in late September 2021.\n\nMr Jaskolski then cross-referenced them with satellite imagery. \"Within 90 seconds, we found the balloon off the coast of Taiwan,\" he says.\n\nFrom spy balloons to secret police stations and dissidents on the run, Panorama investigates China's global surveillance operation.

He then fed this outline into his AI software, together with rough coordinates of where it was last seen.\n\nHe also analysed wind models to trace the balloon's path and find its origin.\n\nWorking with satellite images provided by the company Planet Labs, Corey fed all the information into his software, known as RAIC (rapid automatic image categorization), to locate the balloons.\n\nSurveillance balloons are huge - the size of several buses - and carry sophisticated equipment capable of collecting large amounts of data on targets below.\n\nBut photographed by a satellite from space, they appear to be just small white blobs.\n\nMr Jaskolski's research shows that the balloon which flew over the US in February was at one point about 80 miles (130 km) from a nuclear air force base in the state of Montana.\n\nHe also plotted the flight path of the balloon back to its most likely launch site - Hainan Island in the South China Sea.\n\n\"It looks like on the\u2026 launch there was cloud cover,\" he says. \"And if I were going to launch a balloon, I would have chosen a cloudy day in order to minimise that chance of detection.\"\n\nCorey Jaskolski traced the path of the balloon through satellite images such as this one\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London accused the US of itself releasing a large number of high-altitude balloons, which have continuously circled the globe and illegally flown over China's airspace.\n\nIt said that \"China is a responsible country\" which always acts \"in strict compliance with international law and respects all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity\". It added that it rejects \"unfounded allegations to denigrate and attack China\".\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nCoverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. More coverage details\n\nAmerican veteran Venus Williams says a dramatic fall that ruined her hopes of a notable Wimbledon win was \"painful\" and has left her \"in shock\".\n\nWilliams, 43, slipped early in the first-round match against Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, leading to fears she might have to retire injured.\n\nThe five-time champion did continue and pushed Svitolina before losing 6-4 6-3.\n\n\"It was bad luck for me,\" Williams said. \"I can't believe it happened.

They have come from a nearby river and have been used to bulk out the concrete.\n\n\"That has some serious implications on the strength of the concrete,\" says Prof So.\n\nSteel reinforcements were smooth not ridged, which weakens the concrete\n\nAnd steel bars inside the concrete, which should reinforce it, have been found to be smooth instead of ridged.\n\nThis means the concrete doesn't cling to them, again weakening the structure.\n\nIn Turkey, many older buildings collapsed during the quake, but some modern ones also failed.\n\nNew building codes were brought in after a major earthquake in Iznit in 1999, and Prof So says newer buildings should have fared better.\n\n\"I think it's really important that we recognise those and actually do the testing, to find out why these new buildings, which would have been built to code, have failed in such a way,\" she told BBC News.\n\nThe EEFIT team is also analysing the nature of the quake.\n\nDr Yasemin Didem Aktas, co-leader of the", "PPL": 0.7719327211380005, "PPL/lower": 0.7498256412251653, "PPL/zlib": 0.00021166238583438456, "Min-5%": 5.516632891168781, "Min-10%": 4.192173747455373, "Min-20%": 2.9595911491179523, "Min-30%": 2.2719769274955466, "Min-40%": 1.8279961050649727, "Min-50%": 1.512224658682782, "Min-60%": 1.2782199921735626}, {"text": "responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nUkrainian refugees living on a cruise ship in Leith have been moved into new accommodation.\n\nMore than 1,000 Ukrainian refugees had been housed on the MS Victoria however, the Scottish government\u2019s contract with Forth Ports ended on Tuesday.\n\nA lack of sufficient accommodation meant that not all people on board could stay in Edinburgh.\n\nPeople without a home to move to will be temporarily housed in hotels, supported by the Scottish government.\n\nOne of the residents, Natalia Pidruchna, told BBC Scotland how she was feeling about the move.\n\nDominic Raab's replacement as deputy PM has insisted that ministers must be able to demand the \"highest standards\" from civil servants.\n\nOliver Dowden said Mr Raab's exit after a bullying inquiry should not stop ministers holding officials to account.\n\nBut he distanced himself from claims from Mr Raab that civil servants were frustrating the work of government.\n\nAnd he admitted the process for dealing with complaints needed to be \"fairer\".\n\nMr Raab stood down on Friday after a report written by lawyer Adam Tolley KC found he was \"intimidating\" and \"aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nHowever, he hit out at the report's findings, saying they set \"a very dangerous precedent\" and would have a \"chilling effect\" on how minsters work.\n\nHe also claimed there was a risk \"a very small minority\" of officials \"with a passive aggressive culture\" were trying to block reforms they did not like.\n\nAsked about Mr Raab's comments on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Dowden said ministers had all \"experienced frustrations\" during their time working with officials in government.\n\nBut he told the show: \"It has not been my experience working with civil servants that we can't work together in a constructive way. I haven't experienced that.\"\n\nHe added: \"What I would not want to become the outcome of this is there is some kind of diminution in the ability of ministers to expect the highest standards\".\n\nHe also said that the government wanted to look at the process for how officials can raise complaints about the behaviour or ministers, saying there was a need to make it \"simpler, fairer and less complex\".\n\nMeanwhile, a Tory peer who is leading a government review of how the civil service operates has called for a more \"robust culture\" in Whitehall.\n\nWriting in the Observer, Lord Maude, a former Cabinet Office minister, raised the prospect of civil servants being able to have more open political affiliations.\n\nHe said ministers have limited authority to put in place officials of their choice despite relying on them and being accountable for what they do.\n\nHe suggested that ministers could be given more say about appointments while preserving impartiality.\n\n\"The UK is now an outlier, and a better balance needs to be struck,\" he said, adding that without change, \"there will be more cases like Raab's when frustrations boil over\".\n\nHe said that other governments with similar systems, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, \"manage it better than us\".\n\n\"In France, permanent civil servants often have overt political affiliations, and it causes few problems,\" he added.\n\nLord Maude said that without change there would be more cases like that of Mr Raab\n\nMr Tolley's inquiry looked at eight formal complaints about Mr Raab's behaviour during his previous stints as justice secretary, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary.\n\nHis report concluded Mr Raab's conduct involved \"an abuse or misuse of power\", and that he \"acted in a manner which was intimidating\" and \"persistently aggressive\" towards officials.\n\nThe FDA union, which represents civil servants, dismissed Mr Raab's comments that some officials were frustrating the work of government, accused him of peddling \"dangerous conspiracy theories that undermine the impartiality and integrity of the civil service\".\n\nOn Sunday the Liberal Democrats, who have already called on Mr Raab to step down as an MP, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should suspend him as a Conservative MP.\n\nAngela Bassett at the 2023 Oscars, where she lost out on the best supporting actress award to Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nBlack Panther star Angela Bassett will receive an honorary Oscar, 30 years after she was first nominated.\n\nThe actress was nominated for best actress for playing Tina Turner in 1993's What's Love Got to Do with It.\n\nThen this year, she was up for best supporting actress for her role in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - but looked unimpressed when she lost.\n\nAcademy President Janet Yang said she had given \"transcendent performances that set new standards in acting\".\n\nBassett played Queen Ramonda in the Black Panther films, and is also known for her appearances in films like Boyz N the Hood, Malcolm X, Music of the Heart and Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nHowever, some fans pointed out that she deserved to have won a competitive Oscar. Writing in The Root, Shanelle Genai questioned whether the honorary award was \"some sort of consolation prize\".\n\n\"Angela Bassett has quite literally been out-acting and acting circles around nearly everyone for the last few decades,\" she said.\n\n\"She's your favorite actor's favorite actor, for crying out loud... She deserves more than an honorary anything. She deserves the real thing. She's earned the real thing.\"\n\nJournalist Jerome Trammel said the honorary Oscar was \"insulting\".

A big rally has been banned in Leipzig.\n\nOther Germans were angered by the decision to release Lina E - criminal defendants' second names are not made public - after two and a half years in custody - believing this sends a signal to the left that violence against the extreme right is acceptable.\n\nThe judge, Hans Schl\u00fcter-Staats, said Lina E would be allowed out pending the result of her appeal. She is said to be unwell and has had to hand in her identity card and passport.\n\nDelivering his verdict, the judge said that \"opposing right-wing extremists is a respectable motive\", but use of force was only for the state and her actions were still \"serious criminal acts\". He criticised her defence lawyers' argument that the case was politically motivated.\n\nLina E was seen as the ringleader of her far-left group which waged a brutal campaign of violence against the extreme right for several years - using hammers, iron bars and baseball bats.\n\nLeft-wing protesters took to the streets targeting police with bottles and fireworks after the verdict\n\nIn one attack in 2019, the gang attacked a well-known neo-Nazi pub called the Bull's Eye in the town of Eisenach, beating its owner Leon R.

Watch: The latest on the Titanic sub... in 70 seconds\n\nThe huge search for a missing submersible vessel near the wreck of the Titanic has entered a critical stage, as fears mount over the oxygen levels that may be on board.\n\nIf the sub is still functional and intact, it may only have low levels of oxygen left based on earlier estimates.\n\nIt went missing in a remote area of the North Atlantic on Sunday with a four-day oxygen supply for its crew of five.\n\nAnd on Thursday many questions remained over how it could be recovered.\n\nThe minivan-sized submersible, which was owned and operated by the private company OceanGate Expeditions, is yet to be located. If it is found, it will need to be reached by complex rescue equipment and then brought to the surface in an operation that would likely take hours.\n\nThat would need to happen before the oxygen supply runs out and without damaging its structure or endangering those on board.\n\nThe condition of the vessel and its crew of five is unknown, but the US Coast Guard said the operation remains a rescue mission. \"This is a search-and-rescue mission, 100%,\" Captain Jamie Frederick told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThere appeared to be a glimmer of hope after officials said undersea noises had been detected by Canadian search planes on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nBut it is still unclear what these were, and officials said they may not have come from the submersible. Remote-controlled underwater search vehicles (ROVs) were deployed to the area where the sounds were detected but are yet to find anything.\n\nOne of the ROVs, deployed from the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic, reached the ocean floor early Thursday morning. Several more were expected to arrive at the site later in the day, along with more multi-national support.\n\nA French research ship, the Atalante, also arrived in the area on Thursday morning and deployed its own ROV, the US Coast Guard said. That robot is capable of researching depths below the Titanic wreck, which lies about 12,500 ft (3,810m) below the surface, and has experience of surveying the Titanic.\n\nThe overall area of sea being scoured is about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles), twice the size of the US state of Connecticut. The area is prone to stormy conditions and poor visibility which makes search operations more challenging, experts say.\n\nOn board the 21-foot vessel is British businessman Hamish Harding, British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, former French navy diver Paul-Henry Nargeolet and the CEO of OceanGate - which operates the submersible - Stockton Rush.\n\n\"One of the factors that makes it hard to predict how much oxygen is left is that we do not know the rate of the consumption of oxygen per occupant on the sub,\" Rear Admiral John Mauger from the US Coast Guard told the BBC.\n\nDr Ken LeDez, a hyperbaric medicine expert at Memorial University in St John's, Newfoundland, told the BBC it was possible the crew could survive even as oxygen supplies dwindle, depending on the crew's fitness and the conditions in the submersible.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know the exact conditions inside, Dr LeDez said the crew will likely be facing increasing levels of carbon dioxide and could also be dealing with cold temperatures, along with the declining levels of oxygen.\n\nA combination of these factors could lead to hypothermia and a loss of consciousness, he said. But these conditions aren't necessarily deadly and their metabolisms slowing down because of the cold could help them survive longer, he added.\n\n\"They're very smart... very accomplished people in there,\" he said. \"If anybody can survive\" in it, \"it's these individuals.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWizz Air operates short-haul flights from eight UK airports including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Gatwick and Luton\n\nWizz Air was the worst major airline for flight delays from UK airports for the second year in a row, new figures show.\n\nThe Hungarian carrier's UK departures were an average of 46 minutes and six seconds behind schedule in 2022.\n\nIt is based on analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data by the PA news agency.\n\nThat was more than three times longer than the previous year, when it was also ranked last for punctuality.\n\nThe analysis took into account all scheduled and chartered departures from UK airports by airlines with more than 2,500 flights.\n\nThe average delay for all these flights was 23 minutes.\n\nAfter Wizz Air, Tui ranked second with an average delay of 40 minutes and 18 seconds, and Qatar Airways third with 31 minutes and 48 seconds.\n\nNorwegian Air Shuttle recorded the best performance with an average delay of just 13 minutes and 42 seconds.\n\nMay and June were the worst months for punctuality as the aviation sector failed to recruit and train enough staff to cope with a surge in demand for holidays following the ending of the UK's Covid-19 travel rules.\n\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which?

You can't let anything happen to them. You've got to do what you can for them and their family until the right help comes along.\"\n\nShe has also dealt with a young mother's suicide.\n\nThese are both cases in which officers would still attend.\n\nBut PC Clark said she also regularly handled calls from NHS staff and members of the public \"going home for the weekend in their nine-to-five jobs\", asking the police for a ''welfare check\" on someone with mental health issues.\n\nOfficers can end up sitting with patients for 12 hours and more in hospitals, because no-one else is available and NHS staff are concerned about the risk to the patient, staff or public.\n\nAn early assessment of the impact of the changes in Humberside Police concluded that police turned down requests to carry out welfare checks, or look for patients who had gone \"AWOL\". They also handed over the care of patients more quickly to the health service.\n\nThis meant more patients were seen by health service staff with appropriate training rather than police officers.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Rachel Bacon, from the National Police Chiefs' Council said the new approach would be better for people in mental health crises who tended to \"feel criminalised\" when officers turned up to help them. Some mistakenly believed they were under arrest.\n\nCurrently, officers are sometimes required by law when someone is detained under the Mental Health Act, allowing them to be taken to a place of safety, possibly against their will.\n\nBut the National Police Chiefs' Council plans to ask the government to change this.\n\nHow do you think urgent mental health issues should be dealt with?

But we will work with all partners to deliver the Casement Park stadium.\"\n\nAsked how much money the UK government was willing to contribute, he said: \"I don't actually know how much the whole thing is going to cost.

Hammond and O'Leary usually present the daytime show on Fridays but stepped in on Monday.\n\n\"We can't start today's show without paying tribute to the man who spent the last two decades sitting on the This Morning sofa, Phillip Schofield,\" Hammond said on Monday.\n\nO'Leary continued: \"So, as a show, everyone on and off screen at ITV and This Morning want to say a huge thank you to Phil for what he's done to make this show such a success over the last 21 years.\"\n\n\"Quite simply, we all know he's one of the best live television broadcasters this country has ever had,\" Hammond continued, \"and we and all the team wish him all the best for the future\".\n\nO'Leary concluded: \"So, Holly is now taking a break over half-term. She will be back in this studio in two weeks, on Monday 5 June.\"\n\nHowever, on Thursday's programme, Willoughby said \"see you Monday\" to viewers - suggesting her absence this week was not planned and her half-term holiday has been brought forward.\n\nSchofield and Willoughby picked up the best daytime prize at the National Television Awards in 2019\n\nFormer This Morning presenter Eamonn Holmes, who was dropped in 2021, was less complimentary about Schofield on his GB News breakfast show on Monday.\n\nDuring the newspaper review, when Holmes' co-host Isabel Webster said Schofield was \"stepping down\", Holmes replied: \"Oh please just stop this. He was sacked. All this nonsense of 'I've decided to step down'. I'm sure you did - 'Here's your P45, now step down'.\"\n\nHe went on to quote Willoughby's statement about Schofield's departure, commenting: \"And she says, 'Oh, the couch will not be the same without him being there'. Well she wanted him not there. So what is she moaning about? They deserve each other, I suppose.\"\n\nHolmes described her statement as \"stabbing in the back\" and said his phone was \"full of people who are glad to see the back of the two of them\".\n\nMeanwhile Piers Morgan, who left ITV's Good Morning Britain in 2021 following an on-air clash with the show's weather presenter, said he had \"sympathy\" with Schofield, who he believes was entitled to a \"better send-off\".\n\n\"Anyone who thinks that daytime telly is full of smiley, nicey, happy clappy people, I think they are beginning to realise it is infested by a pack of savages,\" Morgan told Times Radio.\n\nFormer ITV host Piers Morgan said he felt Schofield was entitled to a better send-off from This Morning\n\n\"There is nothing more ruthless than the way that talent, as we [presenters] so laughably get called in television, get treated when the plug gets pulled.\n\n\"So I have some sympathy with Phillip Schofield, who actually I do think after 20-odd years on This Morning, winning awards every year, doing great... I think whatever has gone on behind the scenes, I think he was entitled to a better send-off.\"\n\nAsked what Schofield might do next, Morgan replied that it \"can be a very nice life after ITV\".\n\nITV has said Schofield will still present the British Soap Awards and another forthcoming peak-time series following his exit from This Morning.\n\nJosie Gibson is among the names who have been mentioned as a possible replacement\n\nAlison Hammond rose to fame as a contestant on Big Brother in 2002 before forging a successful presenting career.

The London-born singer has sold more than 100 million albums, and earlier this year she announced that her lavish Las Vegas residency would be extended. Reportedly, this pays \u00a3500,000 per show.\n\nHarry Styles had the biggest-selling UK album last year with \"Harry's House\", and is currently on tour in the UK. The 29-year-old's wealth is pegged at \u00a3150m.\n\nSitting on top of the main Rich List is Gopi Hinduja and family, who own a vast conglomerate of businesses across the world and whose combined wealth is \u00a335bn, up from \u00a328.4bn last year.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe makes a return to the top 10 of Britain's richest people after two years down the ranks.\n\nNow worth \u00a329.6bn, Sir Jim is perhaps best known at the moment for his battle to buy Manchester United, his football team since boyhood. He made his fortune through Ineos, a chemicals and raw materials business.\n\nWhile the Rich List is made up of the uber-wealthy, this is the first year that the number of billionaires has fallen since the global financial crisis in 2008 when the banking industry nearly collapsed.\n\nThere are now 171 billionaires listed, down by six from the previous year. The economic impact of Covid, high inflation and rising interest rates - which make it more expensive to borrow money - have weighed on the fortunes of the rich.\n\nSir Richard Branson, who recently told the BBC he feared losing everything during the pandemic, has seen his wealth almost halve to \u00a32.4bn. The man behind the airline Virgin Atlantic said he lost \u00a31.5bn as Covid lockdowns grounded flights and kept his hotels and health clubs shuttered.\n\nMr Sunak and his wife Ms Murthy have also seen their fortunes fall by \u00a3200m, from the \u00a3730m they were worth last year to \u00a3529m.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murthy are worth \u00a3529m\n\nThe majority of their wealth comes from Ms Murthy who owns a sizable stake in her father's IT business Infosys.\n\nThe newly-crowned King Charles III has the relatively low ranking of 263 on the Rich List with a fortune of \u00a3600m. However, he is wealthier than his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was worth \u00a3320m, according to last year's list.\n\nConsiderably richer is JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books. She is worth \u00a3875m, a rise of \u00a325m from the previous year. She could become wealthier still - the writer is reportedly in talks with the TV network HBO about making her most famous creation into a series.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the stars of the Harry Potter films are on the list of the richest under 35s. Daniel Radcliffe, 33, is worth \u00a392m while Emma Watson, also 33, has an estimated wealth of \u00a360m.\n\nClaimants stand outside the High Court ahead of a hearing in the Primodos legal action in May\n\nClaims for damages by more than 170 people who say they were affected by hormone-based pregnancy test drugs have been thrown out by a High Court judge.\n\nThe drugs, including Primodos, were given to women to test if they were pregnant from the 1950s to 1970s and alleged to have caused birth defects.\n\nBut the judge ruled there was no new evidence linking the tests with foetal harm", "PPL": 1.4960733652114868, "PPL/lower": 0.9008630070828801, "PPL/zlib": 0.00040379847913940266, "Min-5%": 8.201933842079312, "Min-10%": 6.736649010695663, "Min-20%": 5.037844917884957, "Min-30%": 4.0876229733519915, "Min-40%": 3.4089717542921125, "Min-50%": 2.8865494541059142, "Min-60%": 2.4666998880499738}, {"text": "that is not likely to be ready for another three years and they will first have to spend an estimated \u00a310m renovating their comparatively dilapidated back-streets Kenilworth Road home.\n\nThey will still have the smallest ground capacity in the top flight next season, but it is all still a far cry from when they dropped out of the Football League in 2009, before taking five seasons to get back in 2014, eventually under John Still.\n\nThey took the next two steps under Jones, with back-to-back promotions in 2018 and 2019 before he moved on to Stoke.\n\nHaving returned for a second spell to establish the Hatters as Championship promotion contenders, Jones then moved on again.\n\nBut, since Edwards took over, he has presided over 18 wins and just six defeats from his 35 matches in charge.\n\nDefeat for Coventry for the first time in a Wembley final was particularly cruel.\n\nTheir fans have had a tortuous time since being relegated from the Premier League in 2001.\n\nIn 2005 they were forced to leave their Highfield Road home, then two years later they were saved from potential extinction by just minutes following Sisu's late takeover.\n\nIn 2013 they sought refuge from their ongoing rent row with the local council by moving to Northampton.\n\nThey moved back to their home at the Ricoh Arena the following year, with fellow tenants Wasps now their new landlords.\n\nBut in 2019 they had to move again, with two seasons spent at Birmingham City's St Andrew's.\n\nThey then found themselves bottom of the league, without a pitch, at the start of this season, when they had to postpone four home games, playing six of their first seven away.\n\nThey were then even briefly without a ground too, when they were served with the threat of an eviction by the stadium's new owners.\n\nBut boss Mark Robins and his assistant manager Adi Viveash, both rewarded in the past fortnight with new four-year contracts, did a brilliant job turning their season round - and the club were put even more firmly back on the rails when new owner Doug King took over in January.\n\nIn the short term, failing to go up might yet cost them the services of their much-admired star striker Gyokeres, who failed to score in the Sky Blues' final five games, and Brazilian playmaker Hamer.\n\nBut Robins and his team have crucially won back the Coventry fans - and they will start next season among the Championship promotion favourites.\n\n\"We lost Tom Lockyer, but recovered really well after that and showed a lot of emotional strength and character.\n\n\"We lost our captain and best player.

Then they shell us and we have to go back. It's a race.\"\n\nFor all the hardship we observe during two weeks on the road in Ukraine, it's a race the engineers seem to be winning. People grumble, for sure, when the lights go out, their apartments grow cold and the water stops flowing. Hospitals have reported higher numbers of road traffic accidents as motorists move around darkened city roads.\n\nBut away from the front lines, people have adjusted to the lack of electricity much as they have to the air raid sirens and occasional explosions: with pragmatism and ingenuity.\n\nOn city streets, in the middle of a blackout, portable generators churn away on pavements and down alleyways. In Kyiv, for all the midwinter gloom, shops are open, restaurants full. Walk into any motorway service station and the same scene greets you every time: brightly lit, well-stocked shelves, muzak playing and the hand-driers in immaculate toilets blasting out hot air.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking you were anywhere else in Europe. And that's the way those in charge of Ukraine's energy grid would like it.\n\n\"It was our aim for many years, to integrate into the European grid,\" says Oleksandr Kharchenko, EIRC's director. \"And now it's happened.\"\n\nRussia's energy war, just like its military campaign, is having the exact opposite of its desired effect. Far from separating Ukraine from Europe, it's binding it ever closer, in a process that mirrors the country's gradual integration into the Western military alliance, Nato.\n\nUkraine officially declared its desire to join the European grid in 2017. It's typically a lengthy process - it took Turkey 11 years - but when Vladimir Putin decided to invade last year, the process accelerated dramatically. In February last year Ukraine disconnected itself from the Russian grid for the first time, to test the country's ability to manage in \"isolated mode\" during the winter months, when demand for electricity peaks.\n\nThe disconnect, the first of two, was due to take place on the 18th and last just three days. The Russians requested a delay. It eventually happened at 01:00 on 24 February.\n\n\"We disconnected four hours before the invasion started, from this very building,\" Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, told me at his Kyiv headquarters.\n\n\"When the invasion started, it became obvious we would not reconnect.\"\n\nWas the invasion timed to coincide with Ukraine's moment of maximum isolation?\n\n\"I absolutely believe the war started on the 24th just because of this,\" Kharchenko says.\n\nInfrastructure was targeted in the early days, but not enough to plunge the country into chaos.\n\n\"They thought we would have a national blackout,\" Kharchenko says. \"That this would cause panic, no connection, no government, no-one knows where the president is, how to connect with your siblings, your parents.\"\n\nAmid mounting speculation about Moscow's intentions in the weeks before 24 February, the company had quietly moved the grid's main control room to an undisclosed location further west. A second experimental disconnect was scheduled for June, when demand is typically low. If everything went according to plan, Ukraine would finally join the European grid in October 2023.\n\nBut with industry shutting down and millions of Ukrainians fleeing the country, electricity consumption plummeted by 40% within three days of the invasion. Ukrenergo asked its European partners if it could bring forward the second test.\n\n\"They looked at us like we were crazy,\" Kharchenko, who advises Ukrenergo, recalls.\n\nBut by 16 March, it was all done. With Russian troops still menacing the capital, Ukraine connected to the European grid, a year-and-a-half ahead of schedule. For a few months, Ukraine was even able to export its excess electricity.\n\nThat all stopped in October. Since then, the country has had to make do with half the electricity it had before 24 February.\n\n\"I think the reason is the same why they cannot win on the battlefield,\" Kudrytskyi says. \"Because we were prepared and we were resolved to win this particular battle.\"\n\nUkraine has fought many battles over the past year.\n\nIn a sprawling, hilltop cemetery on the edge of the eastern city of Dnipro, hundreds of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags flap noisily in the stiff breeze. Rows of freshly dug graves await the latest casualties from the front, 100 miles to the east.

Semenya has twice failed in legal battles to overturn the decision.\n\nHowever, the case at the ECHR was not against sporting bodies or DSD rules - but specifically against the government of Switzerland for not protecting Semenya's rights and dates back to a Swiss Supreme Court ruling three years ago.\n\nIn a lengthy judgement published on Tuesday, the ECHR found the Swiss government did not protect Semenya from being discriminated against when its Supreme Court refused to overturn a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), which upheld the World Athletics rules.\n\nCas has previously ruled that testosterone rules for athletes like Semenya, were discriminatory - but that the discrimination was \"necessary, reasonable and proportionate\" to protect \"the integrity of female athletics\".\n\nWhile the judgement would appear to vindicate Semenya's long-held view that she has suffered discrimination, it's uncertain if or how the court's decision will impact the current restrictions on DSD athletes.\n\nWorld Athletics has doubled down on its position in its efforts to protect fair competition in the female category, and is also keen for the Swiss courts to challenge the ECHR verdict.\n\nThere is a three-month window to lodge an appeal. In terms of competing - if that's what she wants - that leaves Semenya in a similar position to where she was before the ECHR ruling, unless she takes medication to suppress her testosterone or World Athletics is forced to change its position on DSD athletes, and it's not clear how that could happen.\n\nAs it stands, she still cannot compete in female track events.\n\nAn ECHR statement said Semenya \"had not been afforded sufficient institutional and procedural safeguards in Switzerland\" to allow her to \"have her complaints examined effectively, especially since her complaints concerned substantiated and credible claims of discrimination as a result of her increased testosterone level caused by differences of sex development.\"\n\nThe EHCR ruling suggests that the World Athletics' DSD regulations were \"a source of discrimination\" for Semenya \"by the manner in which they were exercised and by their effects\", and the regulations were \"incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights\".\n\nThe decision, made by a panel of seven people at the ECHR, was split 4-3 in favour of Semenya and may allow her to challenge the Swiss Supreme Court or Cas rulings.\n\nWorld Athletics described the ECHR chamber as \"deeply divided\" and said it will ask the Swiss government to refer the case to the ECHR Grand Chamber for a \"final and definitive decision\".\n\nWorld Athletics said: \"We remain of the view that the DSD regulations are a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of protecting fair competition in the female category as the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Swiss Federal Tribunal both found, after a detailed and expert assessment of the evidence.\n\n\"We will liaise with the Swiss government on the next steps. In the meantime, the current DSD regulations, approved by the World Athletics Council in March 2023, will remain in place.\"\n\nA statement from Semenya's lawyers said: \"Caster has never given up her fight to be allowed to compete and run free. Today's judgment is testament to her resilience and courage. This important personal win for her is also a wider victory for elite athletes around the world.\n\n\"It means that sporting governance bodies around the world must finally recognise that human rights law and norms apply to the athletes they regulate.\"\n\nA statement from Athletics South Africa said the ruling \"vindicated\" its belief that the existing DSD rules were \"ill-conceived\" - and that it would seek legal advice about the consequences for Semenya's potential future participation in athletics.\n\nUnder regulations introduced in 2018, athletes with DSD were only allowed to compete in track events between 400m and the mile if they reduced their testosterone levels.\n\nHowever, in March World Athletics ruled that DSD athletes must now have hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before being eligible to compete in all events.\n\nSemenya ran in the 5,000m at last year's World Championships in Oregon but failed to qualify for the final.\n\nShe has argued that taking testosterone-reducing medication could endanger her health and that the ruling denied her and other athletes with DSD the right to rely on their natural abilities.\n\nBecause of the ruling, she could not defend her 800m title at the Tokyo Olympics, which took place a year later than planned in 2021.\n\nSemenya, who has always been legally identified as female, has said she should be able to compete in women's events even if her testosterone levels are higher than her competitors.\n\nIn 2019 she told BBC Sport she had been \"crucified\" but will \"never stop fighting\" against the regulations brought in by World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.\n\nYsbyty Gwynedd in Bangor is one of the hospitals administered by the health board\n\nA troubled health board has failed to recruit a new chief executive, despite \"an intensive search\" and offering a salary of \u00a3225,000.\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, covering north Wales, has had four leaders in the past four years.\n\nThe Welsh government put it back into special measures in February over patient safety concerns.\n\nBut management said a search for a new chief executive has so far proved unsuccessful.\n\nConcerns were raised in February 2023 about the way the Betsi Cadwaladr health board was being run.\n\nA report by Audit Wales said that evidence \"points to dysfunctionality and factions\" within the senior executive team, and \"the whole team is not united\" around the then interim chief executive.\n\nIt highlighted \"clear and", "PPL": 0.9716425538063049, "PPL/lower": 0.8218983044694667, "PPL/zlib": 0.000275174894875759, "Min-5%": 6.152253524929869, "Min-10%": 4.824466745058696, "Min-20%": 3.5166823237332854, "Min-30%": 2.7791651730040385, "Min-40%": 2.2676826559725844, "Min-50%": 1.8907921543868724, "Min-60%": 1.6065165720855763}, {"text": "said it was liaising with the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) Northern Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\nDonald Trump told the meeting of Republicans he was the only candidate who can win the 2024 presidential election\n\nRepublican presidential hopefuls have shared a stage for the first time in the 2024 White House race at an Iowa campaign event.\n\nAll 13 candidates were given 10 minutes to speak during the event.\n\nPolls show Mr Trump holds a lead over his rivals even as his legal woes mount.\n\nHe told attendees that he was the only candidate who can win next year's election and suggested this was the only reason he faces a raft of criminal and civil charges.\n\nMr Trump has already insisted he will still run for the White House, even if he is convicted.\n\nThere were more than 1,200 people in the huge ballroom - all of whom have an outsize influence on who will be the Republican nominee.\n\nMany said they have a genuinely open mind about who they will vote for, but there was no shortage of Trump stickers among the crowd.\n\nThere was no fun to be had watching the different candidates interacting with each other.

When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.\n\nMeanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.\n\nWhen Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.\n\nBut this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.\n\nThe idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.\n\nAt some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.\n\nBut some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.\n\nMastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".\n\nBut concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.\n\nOne other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews.

I do think we could have done a couple of things better,\" said England boss Wiegman afterwards.\n\n\"We want to learn from these games and do better every game as other countries want to do too. It shows how close and how tight our competition is.\"\n\nThe stadium announcer at Wembley welcomed England as the \"European champions here to defend their title\" with great enthusiasm - but it was not the exhilarating match many had hoped for.\n\nAn early challenge on Russo, which led to her needing medical attention for a cut to her shin, meant there was a lengthy stoppage and England took a while to find their rhythm afterwards.\n\nRusso's infamous backheel in the semi-final two years was in the memories of many fans as they headed to Wembley on Friday and she had her moment again but this time it was not enough to lift the crowd.\n\nPaper planes were thrown around the stands and fans shone their phone camera lights in the second half as the atmosphere dipped in correlation with England's performance.\n\nSloppy in possession and lacking creativity up front, this was not the vintage England that won Euro 2022.\n\nTheir task is to qualify from the toughest group on paper and this was not an ideal start, albeit against a strong Sweden side who will fancy themselves to go all the way in Switzerland next year.\n\nThe visitors were well organised in defence and strong in their press, with manager Peter Gerhardsson saying they had a plan to \"take away Keira Walsh\" and prevent the England midfielder from having an impact.\n\n\"The number one [plan] was to take away Keira Walsh and then you can disturb her,\" he said.\n\n\"It's more that we tried to press so their faces were down and they can't make the decisions. Today for our number 10, it was all about taking away Keira Walsh, but we will not play that way at home.\"\n\nIt was a moment of quality from James which teed up Russo's goal - a lovely, dinked cross from the right which the Arsenal striker only had to nod over the line - but Bronze's lapse in concentration, allowing Rolfo to creep in behind, proved costly.\n\nAt the venue the Lionesses lifted the trophy two years ago, this was not the same feeling at full-time as many left Wembley feeling deflated at an underwhelming start to the qualifying campaign.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

Ukraine's Red Cross says its warehouse was hit.\n\nIt marks the fourth attack in eight days on Kyiv and comes just 24 hours before Russia celebrates Victory Day.\n\nThe annual holiday commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany during World War Two, a conflict the Kremlin has baselessly tried to draw parallels with since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nAfter a lull in Russian attacks on civilian targets in recent months, which saw Kyiv go days without an attack, Moscow has intensified its air raids over the past week ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said the latest Russian raids - which lasted for more than four hours and were launched shortly after midnight - saw Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones swarm across the country.\n\nKyiv's Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said nearly 60 drones had been launched by Russia, describing it as the \"biggest\" such attack so far.\n\nHe added that all 36 drones had been destroyed over Kyiv, but five people had been injured by falling debris from downed drones.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these numbers.\n\nEmergency services responded after drone wreckage fell on a runway at Zhuliany international airport - one of the city's two commercial airports - Kyiv's military administration said.\n\nAnd civilians were injured after drone debris hit a residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, the administration added.\n\nElsewhere, in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, a warehouse was set ablaze after eight missiles were fired at targets by Russian bombers, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nIn a statement, Ukraine's Red Cross said its warehouse with humanitarian aid was destroyed and all aid deliveries had to be suspended.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Southern Command, later said a body of a man - a security guard - was pulled from the wreckage.\n\nIn a daily update, the Ukrainian military's command said there had also been a wave of missile strikes on the Kherson, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions.\n\nAt least eight people - including a child - were injured in two villages in the southern Kherson region, local officials said.\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, the head of the Russian installed administration, Vladimir Rogov, said Russian forces hit a warehouse and a Ukrainian troop position in the small city of Orikhiv.\n\nOn the eastern front, the Ukrainian commander of forces in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut said Russian troops had stepped up shelling, in a bid to take the city by Tuesday's celebrations.\n\nRussian troops and fighters from the Wagner Group, a private military company, have been trying to capture Bakhmut for months - despite its questionable strategic value.\n\nOver the weekend, Wagner's founder Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared to U-turn on a threat to withdraw from the city after he was promised fresh ammunition supplies by the defence ministry in Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that 9 May would from now be celebrated as Europe Day, in line with the European Union. The move - which needs parliamentary approval - is seen as a pointed rebuke to Russia.\n\nMr Zelensky said he had signed a decree that the day would commemorate European unity and the defeat of \"Ruscism\" - a term that is shorthand for \"Russian fascism\".\n\nHe also said that 8 May would now officially be a Day of Remembrance and Victory, as marked in many countries around the world.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will hold talks with Mr Zelensky in Kyiv on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, as Russia is preparing for Tuesday's Victory Day parade on Moscow's Red Square, the Kremlin is yet to reveal what President Vladimir Putin's role will be at the annual event.\n\nLast year, Mr Putin addressed the marching troops and was seen sitting among World War Two veterans in the VIP box.\n\nRussia says the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - all former Soviet republics - are expected at the parade, which has been otherwise snubbed by major world countries, including the UK, the US and France - all wartime allies of the then Soviet Union.\n\nIn a separate development, a court in Berlin banned the carrying of Russian and Soviet flags during rallies at Soviet war memorials in the German capital on 9 May.\n\nStephen Lawrence was killed in April 1993, at Eltham in south-east London\n\nEarlier this week, the BBC publicly named a major suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder. In response, Stephen's mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence said, \"It should not have taken a journalist to do the job that a huge, highly resourced institution should have done.\" Correspondent Daniel De Simone started investigating the case after the Metropolitan Police stopped.\n\nInvestigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence is a journey into the past and the present.\n\nStephen was murdered 30 years ago in a racist attack by a gang of young white men.\n\nTwo years ago, I set out to follow a lead which had the potential to bring significant new information to light.\n\nThe Met had stopped investigating Stephen's murder in 2020. I wanted to do what I could to investigate the outstanding suspects and hold them to account.\n\nI had no previous experience of covering the case and I felt daunted by it. Journalists had been covering the story since the 1990s, and there had been more than 15 police investigations or official inquiries. Who was I to imagine I could find anything new?\n\nThe lead I followed related to a man who was said to have possibly been there when Stephen was murdered. I was unsure whether this was as a witness or a suspect. I did not know the man's identity, and it took months to get a name.

At the start of the season he predicted Leicester would struggle and needed to target 40 points to survive - they finished 18th and were relegated with 34 points.\n\nTurnover decreased to \u00a3177.3m - down from \u00a3214.6m the previous year - but chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha cleared the club's outstanding \u00a3194m debt to parent company King Power International last February.\n\nThe Foxes owed the amount in loans to KPI, which is owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family, but a debt-to-equity transfer was completed.\n\n\"The long-term and ongoing financial security and commitment provided by Khun Aiyawatt, the Srivaddhanaprabha family and King Power International, enables the club to rebuild with certainty and confidence,\" added Whelan.\n\nThe release of Leicester's accounts comes 12 days after they were charged by the Premier League for alleged PSR breaches and for failing to submit audited finances.\n\nLeicester will have \"add backs\", which include spending on its women's team and the academy, which will bring their losses down in the Premier League's calculations, while they are reporting for 13 months rather than 12.\n\nThis was a long-term club decision to bring Leicester's accounting in line with the rest of the business.\n\nThe \u00a3215.3m loss over three years includes a \u00a333.1m pre-tax loss from the 2020-21 season, in which they lifted the FA Cup, and the club-record loss of \u00a392.5m a year later.\n\nIf found guilty of breaking spending rules, which allow clubs to average losses of \u00a335m per season in the Premier League, Leicester could face a points deduction.\n\nAs the case, including any appeals, is likely to run beyond the end of this season, it means any potential sanctions will be enforced next season.\n\nTop-flight sides Everton and Nottingham Forest have already been punished with points deductions this season for breaking rules.\n\nLeicester are also the subject of a separate financial probe by the English Football League (EFL), who followed up the Premier League charge by imposing a registration embargo on the East Midlands club.\n\nThe Foxes reacted by starting legal proceedings against both the EFL and Premier League.\n\nLeicester City have put the \u00a389.7m loss down to three key issues.\n\nFirst was the drop in Premier League prize money - as the club fell from eighth to 18th in the space of 12 months. That drop-off resulted in the club's relegation from the top flight, but also a reduction of about \u00a330-35m in prize money revenue.\n\nSecondly, there is the lack of European football after the club failed to qualify the previous season.\n\nAnd thirdly there is a clear message on the significant and \"costly\" price to move Brendan Rodgers and his backroom staff out of the club, exactly a year ago today.\n\nThis is a jaw-dropping amount of cash for a football club to lose. It is the result of Leicester trying to bridge the gap to the Premier League's top six - and failing in their recruitment of personnel and performances on the pitch.\n\nWhat is perhaps most significant is the amount of money clearly being spent on wages. Despite a near \u00a375m profit in player trading, the club still finds itself the best part of \u00a390m in the red.\n\nLeicester have become known as a club that hands out generous contracts", "PPL": 0.6023080348968506, "PPL/lower": 0.7130159204593026, "PPL/zlib": 0.00016814853012195717, "Min-5%": 4.639157786088831, "Min-10%": 3.5680741398942235, "Min-20%": 2.464397445576115, "Min-30%": 1.8395301023989625, "Min-40%": 1.4509113918634673, "Min-50%": 1.1878893272996764, "Min-60%": 0.9992973679397559}, {"text": "Sturgeon became first minister and SNP leader after the referendum of September 2014 failed to deliver Scottish independence.\n\nAt that point she was already a seasoned politician, having been a member of the Scottish Parliament since 1999, and deputy leader of her party since 2004.\n\nUnder her stewardship she led the SNP to a series of election victories at UK, Scottish and local level.\n\nFormer Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants a \"bit more anonymity\"\n\nWhen Ms Sturgeon announced her resignation at a hastily arranged press conference on 15 February her colleagues talked of their shock.\n\nHer then deputy first minister John Swinney said he was \"very sorry\" to hear the news but \"completely\" understood.\n\nMs Sturgeon told the gathered media that a first minister was \"never off duty\", had \"virtually no privacy\" and it \"takes its toll on you and those around you\".\n\nIn this second episode of the BBC podcast, crime writer Val McDermid said some of the rumours she had heard about Ms Sturgeon were \"laughable in their absurdity\".\n\nThe politician's friend added that there were those who wrongly claimed \"exclusive knowledge\" about her.\n\nCrime writer says some of the stories about her friend Nicola Sturgeon are incorrect\n\nMcDermid said: \"She [Sturgeon] has been a focus for the lies as well as the criticism, and that is deeply upsetting.\"\n\nThe podcast also heard from Liz Lloyd, who was Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff and had worked with her for more than 20 years.\n\nShe speaks about her former boss's \"look when you say something stupid\", her \"sharp sense of humour\" and the fact \"she can laugh at herself\".\n\nMs Sturgeon formally stepped down on 27 March when her former health secretary Humza Yousaf won the contest to succeed her as SNP leader and first minister.\n\nAlthough giving up front line politics, she will remain an SNP MSP for the Glasgow Southside constituency and sit on the backbenches.\n\nHear more of the conversation by subscribing to the Nicola Sturgeon podcast on BBC Sounds -

Founded in 1856, the bank has been a pillar of the Swiss financial sector ever since. Although buffeted by the financial crisis of 2008, Credit Suisse did manage to weather that storm without a government bailout, unlike its rival-turned-rescuer UBS.\n\nMore recently, the marketing face of Credit Suisse has been Switzerland's tennis god Roger Federer. He smiles down from posters at Swiss airports, a symbol of strength, excellence, staying power and reliability.\n\nBut behind the glossy promotion were some big problems. Divisive management, costly exposure to finance company Greensill Capital, which collapsed in 2021, a seedy money laundering case, and waning customer confidence in the last few months, which saw billions being withdrawn from the bank.\n\nAll it took to turn those doubts into a stampede was an apparently off the cuff remark from the Saudi National Bank, which owns almost 10% of Credit Suisse, suggesting it would not be increasing its investment.\n\nCredit Suisse's shares went into free fall, and even a statement of confidence from the Swiss National Bank, and an offer of $50bn (\u00a341bn) in financial support, couldn't stabilise the situation.\n\nHow could this have happened?\n\nAfter the financial crisis 15 years ago Switzerland introduced strict so-called \"too big to fail\" laws for its biggest banks. Never again, went the thinking, should the Swiss taxpayer have to bail out a Swiss bank, as happened with UBS.\n\nBut Credit Suisse is a \"too big to fail\" bank. In theory, it had the capital to prevent this week's catastrophe.\n\nAlso in theory Swiss financial regulators and the Swiss National Bank keep an eye on those systemically important banks and can intervene before disaster strikes.\n\nIt was odd, last week, to see the rest of the world reacting with real concern as Credit Suisse shares tumbled, and to hear, at first, nothing from Switzerland.\n\nRoger Federer went from winning prize money sponsored by Credit Suisse, to being its marketing figurehead\n\nEven the Swiss media seemed not to notice the headlines over at the Financial Times, and seemed more interested in the continued debate over how much support neutral Switzerland should be offering to Ukraine.\n\nBy the time people did notice, such damage had been done that Credit Suisse was beyond saving. The fallout had begun to threaten not just Switzerland's entire financial sector, but Europe's.\n\nAs the government met in emergency session to try to find a solution, you could almost smell the panic in Bern.\n\nAnnouncing the bank takeover, Swiss President Alain Berset said \"an uncontrolled collapse of Credit Suisse would lead to incalculable consequences for the country and the international financial system\".\n\nIt's hard to avoid the conclusion, some Swiss are now saying, that the very people who should have acted to prevent Credit Suisse's meltdown were asleep at the wheel.\n\nThat lack of attention is going to be very costly. UBS's takeover, for the paltry sum of $3bn (\u00a32.5bn), besides being an utter humiliation for Credit Suisse, is likely to leave its shareholders a good bit poorer.\n\nThere will also be job losses, perhaps in the thousands. There are Credit Suisse and UBS branches in just about every Swiss town. Once the takeover is complete, there will be little point in UBS keeping them all open.\n\nBut perhaps the most costly damage of all could be to Switzerland's reputation as a safe place to invest.\n\nDespite the scandals over the years related to the secret bank accounts of dictators (including Ferdinand Marcos from the Philippines, Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and many more), or the money laundering for drug lords and tax evaders, Swiss banks hung on to that reputation symbolised by Roger Federer: strong, and reliable.\n\nBut now? A system that allows a 167-year-old bank to go belly up, in the space of a few days, at the cost of many jobs and massive losses in share value?\n\nThat could cause huge reputational damage. The Swiss banking sector, Switzerland's financial regulators, and its government, all say the takeover is the best solution.\n\nIn the end, at the very last minute, it was the only solution. In the coming days, there will be some tough questions to answer.\n\nArtwork: The Blue Moon lander will be 16m tall and fully fuelled will weigh over 45 tonnes\n\n", "PPL": 0.7528115510940552, "PPL/lower": 0.8219877630701714, "PPL/zlib": 0.00020698695383394424, "Min-5%": 6.1922960187874585, "Min-10%": 4.679229049121632, "Min-20%": 3.2675638225084414, "Min-30%": 2.413217284877448, "Min-40%": 1.865126178943732, "Min-50%": 1.5015473186966115, "Min-60%": 1.2536635646044432}, {"text": "a screen reader - the phrase \"we're growing the economy\" repeated four times.\n\nBecky Brynolf, who's head of social media at the charity, tells Newsbeat she felt \"a bit of disappointment\" when she saw the tweet.\n\n\"I think that everyone should be able to access the same information.

That means two litres of liquid can be taken through, inside bags. Laptops can also be left in bags.\n\nThey are already used in some other countries including the US.\n\nTrials in the UK began in 2018, and airports have been gradually putting them in place. Some, including Teesside and London City Airport, have already finished their rollouts.\n\nHowever, London Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester are all expected to need extra time to finish installing the new equipment across all their lanes.\n\nThat means some lanes will still use the current scanners for this year's summer holidays, so people will still need to stick to the 100ml liquid limits.\n\nAviation commentator Sally Gethin outlined some of the reasons for the delay.\n\n\"[The scanners] are very heavy. Sometimes the floors in the actual terminal have to be reinforced. The cost is really high for these particular scanners - it's the latest technology,\" she said, also pointing to supply chain issues and airports having to free up staff for training.\n\nConsumer group Which? said it was disappointing that major airports weren't ready\n\nHeathrow has already begun introducing the new equipment in three of its four terminals, but cannot guarantee the rollout will be complete by June.\n\nA source pointed out that Heathrow has 146 security lanes, more than any other UK airport, and the installation process had to be carefully managed to avoid hindering the flow of passengers.\n\nThe airport is understood to be working with the government on how passengers can be provided with \"clear messaging\".\n\nGatwick said it will have made \"significant progress\" in both terminals by June but does not expect to finish installation until early next year \"after the busy summer peak period has concluded\".\n\nConstruction work is under way at Manchester and East Midlands airports to expand terminals to accommodate the new equipment.\n\nA spokesperson for Manchester Airports Group said that while \"good progress\" was being made, completion of the programme is not expected until 2025.\n\nThe BBC understands the DfT may consider allowing airports extensions to complete installations across their whole premises where it deems it \"appropriate\".\n\nHowever, if they miss the deadline without permission, penalties are not being ruled out.\n\nRory Boland, travel editor at Which?, said: \"We're now going to go into a situation where different [UK] airports have different rules, so at some places you will need to get the liquids out in advance, at others you won't.\"\n\nHe said this could cause confusion and hold-ups at security. \"You only need a couple of passengers to not be prepared to end up having to wait an extra 10, 20, 30 minutes.\n\n\"It is disappointing that we're in a situation just months ahead of the peak travel period... and major airports aren't ready.\"\n\nMr Boland said airports' communication with passengers would be very important.\n\nTravel association Abta advised people planning holidays this summer to double check the rules at each end of their journey.\n\n\"It's important to remember that even if your departure airport in the UK has changed its rules around liquids when you travel later this year, you'll also need to check the rules that are in place for the airport you'll be returning from as they may be different,\" Abta said.\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: \"The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience.\n\n\"We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards [the] June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes.

who sacked head coach Ian Foster on Monday after eight losses in 11 games - eased their own relegation fears with the win.\n\nIt moves them up to 19th in the Championship, four points from safety, and means the Millers return to League One with an unassailable 19-point gap to 21st-place Birmingham City with only 15 points left to play for.\n\nInterim Argyle boss Neil Dewsnip made four changes to his side, with all four dropping out being January signings by Foster as Dan Scarr and Callum Wright returned having barely featured under the former head coach.\n\nIn a first half that was low on quality, Argyle had the better of the chances - Wright twice went close after four Argyle players also threatened during a 10th-minute goalmouth scramble.\n\nMumba brought the game to life with a lovely touch to control Morgan Whittaker's precise cross-field pass from the right before blasting past Viktor Johansson to give the Pilgrims a lead they just about deserved.\n\nArgyle's confidence began to grow after the goal and Wright forced a smart save from Johansson with a low far-post header in first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe Millers had to be grateful to their Swedish keeper as time and again he saved them - he tipped Whittaker's powerful low effort around the post before stopping a Jordan Houghton shot.\n\nRotherham had their best chances midway through the second half as first Cohen Bramall hit the side netting having found himself unmarked at the back post from a corner before Sebastian Revan saw Michael Cooper produce his only save of the night soon after.\n\nJohansson again came to the rescue moments later after Cameron Humphreys had got a toe on an Adam Randell cross.\n\nHe then saved a Dan Scarr header from a corner that saw Waine head against the post from the follow up before the New Zealand striker missed a gilt-edged chance when he capitalised on Sebastian Revan's poor back-pass, but Johansson was off his line quickly to save with his foot as the Millers were relegated with a whimper.\n\nFour wins and 26 losses in nightmare Millers season\n\nRotherham have endured a dismal campaign, with just four wins and are guaranteed to finish bottom of the table.\n\nThey have failed to win a single match away from home all season and have not won a league match on their travels since November 2022.\n\nPrevious boss Matt Taylor was sacked in November when they were four points adrift of safety but replacement Leam Richardson could not turn their fortunes around and has won only two of his 21 league games in charge.\n\nThe South Yorkshire side dropped into the bottom three on 23 September and did not climb out of the relegation zone thereafter.\n\nTaylor, who had replaced long-serving Paul Warne in October 2022, kept the club in the second tier last season to end a run of six successive seasons where the club was either promoted to or relegated from the Championship.\n\nThis season was always likely to be a struggle for them and Taylor was sacked on 13 November, two days after a 5-0 reverse at Watford.\n\nBy the time Richardson was appointed on 11 December they had slipped to the foot of the division, a position they would remain in for the rest of the campaign.\n\nRichardson will now hope he is capable of doing what Warne managed after their three previous relegations and lead them straight back up - having led Wigan Athletic to the League One title in 2022.\n\n\"We weren't good enough tonight, I thought the game was very stop start.\n\n\"They shaded it in both boxes, which is the most disappointing thing, and I made my views clear at half-time.\n\n\"This club's experienced it a few times, they've always come back stronger, I feel for the fans at the minute because they've had a really rough season.\n\n\"Myself and [assistant] Rob Kelly came in at the back end of the year and it was there for all to see -

It was also impacted by Covid lockdowns in China which hit consumer access to products.\n\nTupperware has been trying to change its image from house parties in years gone by to younger shoppers\n\nMr Saunders also said that Tupperware - while considered innovative many years ago - was perhaps not as inventive and stylish as other brands such as Joseph Joseph, the home goods design company started by twin brothers Antony and Richard Joseph.\n\nYounger customers have also embraced more environmentally-friendly products such as beeswax paper to keep food fresh which can be used again and again, he said.\n\nTupperware had seen a resurgence during the Covid pandemic as people cooked for themselves at home and its share price surged, but sales have slid since then.\n\nIn a statement, Tupperware said that its shares were in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because it had not yet filed its annual report.\n\nIt also warned that it had to renegotiate its loans after already amending its loan agreements three times since August 2022.\n\nTupperware said it was struggling with higher interest costs on its borrowings while it attempts to turn the business around.\n\nThe company said it \"currently forecasts that it may not have adequate liquidity in the near term\", adding that it \"has therefore concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern\".\n\nJust a month ago, Tupperware's chief financial officer Mariela Matute, who joined the company in May last year, told investors: \"We're confident that we will be able to operate without substantial doubt in 2023.\"\n\nIn addition, Tupperware said that its financial results for 2021 and 2022 as well its interim figures in 2021 and the first three months of 2022 had been \"misstated\" due to how the firm accounted for taxes and leases.\n\nTupperware's share price rose by 5.6% on Tuesday after dropping by nearly 50% on Monday.\n\nThe company said it was working with financial advisers to secure more money and investment. It is also examining whether it can sell property and cut jobs.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: How the Tupperware party became a million dollar idea\n\nMr Saunders said it was doubtful whether Tupperware could do enough now to turn itself around. He said that if the company had made changes 10 years ago, such as selling in shops or through wholesale, it may be in a different position now.\n\nHowever, the brand name is still well-known, he said, and the company could appeal to a retail giant such as Walmart - which used to own Asda - or even Amazon.\n\nTupperware was founded by Earl Tupper, an American chemist, in 1946.\n\nThe polyethylene air-tight and water-tight products - with their double-sealed lid - were sold in department stores but were not immediately successful because potential customers were not sure how to use them.\n\nPeople were used to glass and ceramic products and the new Tupperware container had to be \"burped\" to expel air when being sealed.\n\nA saleswoman called Brownie Wise - who was already selling cleaning products door-to-door at home parties - started selling Tupperware herself.\n\nShe used home demonstrations to find customers and recruited other salespeople to sell the goods.\n\nShe was recruited as a vice president of marketing at Tupperware by Mr Tupper, helping to fuel growth at the business through parties which also allowed women to earn an income.\n\nHowever, the founder and his vice president reportedly clashed over strategy and in 1958, Mr Tupper fired Mrs Wise.

If so, the most obvious upgrade from her current role as finance and economy secretary would be to deputy first minister.\n\nThat's not a prediction. Just an observation. I expect that whatever she might be offered, Kate Forbes would want a fair amount of autonomy if she is to continue in government.\n\nIf he can reach an agreement with her, that could go some way to easing tensions.\n\nThen of course there are significant policy issues to be addressed. Not least the Scottish government's response to the UK blocking the gender recognition reform bill.\n\nAt the start of the leadership contest Humza Yousaf seemed committed to challenging that position in court. More recently, he has left a little more room for manoeuvre by saying he would be guided by the legal advice he receives.\n\nWhile his power-sharing partners in the Greens will be looking for a robust approach, that could risk prolonging divisions in his own party. Careful handling is required.\n\nHumza Yousaf noted in his acceptance speech that delivering independence is the shared goal that unites the SNP.\n\nWhile that is substantially true, it may not be the only factor. It seems to me electoral success and the strong leadership of Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon have also had a binding effect.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Humza Yousaf can maintain their grip.\n\nHis approach to the independence question will also be important.\n\nWhile he has distanced himself from the idea of using the next election as a substitute referendum, he has promised to renew calls for the UK government to give Holyrood the power to hold a vote.\n\nThat may help to underline his commitment to the cause but it is not likely to alter Rishi Sunak's response, which has been to reject indyref2.\n\nHe also risks sending out a mixed message to the wider Scottish public.\n\nHumza Yousaf has promised to be a first minister for everyone in Scotland and to earn the trust and respect of those who are not persuaded on independence by governing well and focusing on shared priorities.\n\nIf the first thing he does is to formally demand another independence referendum, he may struggle to convince some that he is serious about those commitments.\n\nHe has said dealing with cost of living pressures and NHS recovery will be his first concerns.\n\nThese are another two massive challenges that suggest the new first minister's honeymoon period in office, if he gets one, may be particularly short.\n\nAfter being voted leader of the Scottish National Party, we ask -

Back to the present, if you like, after 10 days of Westminster being consumed by looking at Boris Johnson\u2019s conduct in the rear view mirror. The government is in a bind: it is desperate to get inflation down, and yet it is stuck. It is desperate to be able to point to a sense of people feeling better off. But getting inflation down will make many people feel worse off - because the Bank of England cranking up interest rates is a key way to do it. Those timeless trade offs of economics and politics never go away. What is different this time \u2014 courtesy of the government\u2019s colossal interventions in the last few years around Covid and soaring energy bills due to the war in Ukraine \u2014 is there is arguably a greater expectation ministers can or should intervene again. This expectation, or hope, extends to some Tory MPs. The former party chairman Sir Jake Berry has called, for instance, for the return of Mortgage Interest Tax Relief at Source - a Conservative policy in the 1980s and 90s. The Chancellor has rejected this idea. Privately, some ministers and Conservative MPs are exasperated, arguing that not only does there have to be a limit to what government can do and can afford, but a large scale intervention would make inflation worse.\n\nAt least one police officer was assaulted every day in the first four months of this year in the north west, a senior officer has said.\n\nEight officers were assaulted in four separate incidents in Londonderry on Wednesday evening.\n\nCh Insp Yvonne McManus said so many assaults in one evening was \"exceptional for our district\".\n\nBut she said officers are increasingly being subjected to attacks.\n\n\"In relation to where we are as a district, and I know Derry City and Strabane is no exception, between January and April we have had 34.5 assaults per month - that is more than one officer assaulted per day,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today programme.\n\n\"Increasingly our officers are subject to attacks and we are here to help deal with extremely complex issues - issues around vulnerability - and regrettably we are forced to try and resolve these and at time officers are exposed to serious risk themselves\".\n\nCh Insp McManus said the eight officers injured on Wednesday had all been able to remain on duty.\n\nThree people have been charged to court and another reported to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the incidents on Wednesday, she added.\n\nCh Insp McManus urged the public not to take officers for granted.\n\n\"At times they are dealing with very dangerous circumstances and they put themselves in harm's way to protect others and keep the community safe,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this year the PSNI said assaults resulting in injuries to officers are at a five-year high.\n\nAt that time the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, which represents officers, said greater deterrents - including tougher sentencing by the court and the use of Tasers - are needed to prevent assaults on officers.\n\nSign up for notifications to the latest Insight features via the BBC Sport app and find the most recent in the series.\n\n\"It was all I thought about and dreamed about.

I didn't really care about football at that time,\" Gorry told BBC Sport.\n\n\"For as long as I can remember, I thought I would have to hang up the boots to start a family.\n\n\"But I knew I was in the right place. I knew that I wanted to be pregnant and I wanted to have a little one. And everything fell into place.\n\n\"The national team were super supportive.

We have the direct involvement of Mr Morgan in a number of these incidents.\"\n\nMr Morgan was Daily Mirror editor from 1995 until 2004.\n\nMr Sherborne said the alleged unlawful activities also included MGN journalists intercepting landline voicemails, even if the phone numbers were ex-directory - meaning they were not listed in the telephone directory and the phone company would not provide them to those who asked for them.\n\nClaims brought by Harry and three others are being heard in the trial, expected to last six to seven weeks, as being \"representative\" cases of the types of allegations facing the publisher.\n\nThe other claimants are former Coronation Street actors Nikki Sanderson and Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife Fiona Wightman.\n\nThey are all expected to give evidence - when the prince does so in June, he will become the first senior member of the Royal Family to appear in court and be cross-examined in modern times.\n\nThe four cases were chosen by the trial judge to help the court set the level of damages MGN should pay if the claimants win, as well as establish the various allegations facing the publisher.\n\nThe court would then consider other cases from celebrities including the former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl, actor Ricky Tomlinson, former Arsenal and England footballer Ian Wright and the estate of late singer-songwriter George Michael.\n\nMGN has denied the allegations, including those of voicemail interception.\n\nIn its defence against some of the claims made by Prince Harry, MGN's lawyers argued that he did not have \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\".\n\nThis argument was made in response to articles about his relationship with Chelsy Davy - the break-up of which Harry blamed on press intrusion, his alleged drug use and one that reported he was forced to carry out farm work as punishment for wearing a Nazi uniform to a party.\n\nIn other instances it claimed published information was \"limited and banal\".\n\nIn response to one of the 33 articles put forward by Prince Harry's legal team, which gave details about his 18th birthday celebrations, MGN lawyers argued that the information came from an interview the duke gave to the Press Association.\n\nThe article published under the headline \"No Eton trifles for Harry, 18\" in September 2002 \"simply repeated the details that the claimant [Harry] had given\" including that he would not be having a party and would be spending the day with his father and brother, MGN argues in court documents. It said there was \"no evidence of voicemail interception\".\n\nHowever on Wednesday, the publisher acknowledged and \"unreservedly\" apologised for a separate instance of unlawful information gathering against Harry, adding that the legal challenge brought by the prince \"warrants compensation\".\n\nOn Thursday, reporters saw the list of 33 stories at the heart of Prince Harry's claim for damages against MGN.

Watch: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how\" - Piers Morgan (interview filmed in March)\n\nIn Thursday's hearing, Mr Sherborne discussed a Daily Mirror front page story from 1999, which revealed confidential details about the finances of Prince Michael of Kent - cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II - including that he was in debt to a bank.\n\nPrince Michael's lawyers later told MGN they had deduced that a \"blagger\" had called the bank and, posing as the royal's accountant, obtained confidential information.\n\nMGN eventually settled the claim, published an apology and paid his legal costs, the barrister said.\n\n\"It's inconceivable, given the way this progressed, that the legal department and Mr Morgan were not well aware of the source of the story, and that it came from illegally obtained information,\" Mr Sherborne told the court.\n\nMr Morgan has consistently denied any knowledge of phone hacking during his time editing the newspaper, but this will be the first time a court has been asked to rule on claims about what he knew.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Amol Rajan before the trial began, Mr Morgan said he could only talk to what he knew about his own involvement, adding: \"I've never hacked a phone, I wouldn't even know how.\"\n\nMr Morgan also pointed out he only worked for the Daily Mirror and had no responsibility for the Sunday Mirror, Sunday People or other titles.\n\nIn 2015, MGN admitted journalists had regularly used unlawful techniques to obtain private information - and issued a public apology.\n\nThe High Court ordered the publisher to pay out damages totalling \u00a31.25m to eight phone-hacking victims, including more than \u00a3260,000 to the actor Sadie Frost.\n\nThe first minister said there was a high threshold for criminality in the new law\n\nHumza Yousaf said he was \"not surprised\" police had assessed JK Rowling's online posts challenging the new hate crime law to be non-criminal.\n\nThe Harry Potter author described several transgender women as men, including convicted prisoners, trans activists and other public figures.\n\nThe legislation creates a crime of \"stirring up hatred\" relating to protected characteristics.\n\nBut Police Scotland said no action would be taken against Ms Rowling.\n\nThe first minister said the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 \"protects the most vulnerable and marginalised in our in society\" while also safeguarding \"freedom of expression and freedom of speech\".\n\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News: \"Those new offences that have been created by the act have a very high threshold for criminality.\n\n\"The behaviour has", "PPL": 0.850929319858551, "PPL/lower": 0.7543261051052003, "PPL/zlib": 0.0002337717911699316, "Min-5%": 5.937966098972395, "Min-10%": 4.580432122828913, "Min-20%": 3.267425254388077, "Min-30%": 2.5335922358672858, "Min-40%": 2.03859012113078, "Min-50%": 1.6774731403979621, "Min-60%": 1.4127477300156164}, {"text": "to recover from the trauma of losing Harry, Derek turned his attention to investigating East Kent, one of the largest hospital trusts in England.\n\nBeing one step removed from the loss allowed Derek to have \"the helicopter view\", he says.\n\nThe \"grandfather effect\", as he describes it, was what made it possible to focus his fire on the NHS. Being one step removed from the loss allowed him to have \"the helicopter view\", he says. \"You're not as close to the grief of losing your child. But by the same token, you're grieving your grandchild and also seeing the devastation which has happened to your children, which is just dreadful and ongoing.\"\n\nOne of the key documents Derek uncovered was a report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), whose experts had been invited into the trust in November 2015 to assess maternity care. It was damning. Among the findings were that some consultants did not carry out ward rounds, review women, attend out-of-hours calls when requested or complete mandatory training.\n\nDerek found that report had led to a Maternity Improvement Plan overseen by NHS England, but the trust's board papers - which he pored over for hours, weeks on end - showed the problems continued into 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn other words, managers and external regulators knew there were problems in the trust, particularly at the QEQM Hospital. He asks: \"Who followed it up, at the trust, at NHS England?\"\n\nThe one agency that did not know about the RCOG report was the Care Quality Commission (CQC) - which inspects health and social care providers. Derek had written to the CQC to inform it of Harry's death and the problems surrounding it.\n\nThe commission's initial response was to thank him, but to say it would be taking no further action as it appeared his grandson's death had been because of the poor skills of one doctor - the locum who carried out the C-section.\n\nBut Derek persisted and changed the CQC's view of the trust. This eventually led, in June 2021, to East Kent being fined more than \u00a3700,000 for failing to provide both Harry and Sarah with safe care and treatment.\n\nIn October 2019, three months before Harry's inquest was due to take place, Derek decided he had uncovered deep-seated problems at the trust and only publicity was likely to bring change. He saw my coverage of an inquest into the death of 14-year-old Amy Allan, which found significant failings by Great Ormond Street Hospital, and sent me an email.\n\nThe Richford family in January 2020 - at the end of Harry's inquest which concluded his death had been\"wholly avoidable\"\n\nI spent three months with a colleague looking into the East Kent trust. In January 2020 we reported there were significant problems with its maternity services, including the potentially-avoidable deaths of seven babies.\n\nThe coroner at Harry's inquest later that month concluded his death had been\"wholly avoidable\". The family stood outside the court in front of the cameras, tears gently rolling down cheeks, arms and hands tightly gripped around each other. They had achieved their primary aim - justice for Harry.\n\nWithin three weeks of the inquest concluding - and with more serious concerns emerging - NHS England appointed Dr Bill Kirkup to carry out an independent investigation into maternity care at East Kent.\n\nThe publicity led to other families getting in touch with us - and seeking advice from Derek - telling their own stories of poor outcomes. Because he has become viewed as the chief instigator of the inquiry, people randomly contact Derek and - without warning - launch into detailed and often horrific details of what happened in their own case.\n\nDerek says his coping mechanism has been blogging on the web - writing in general terms about the conversations he has had with families, and offering possible useful advice.\n\n\"Writing it down, getting it out of my head and onto a page, I found really useful,\" he says.\n\n\"It has, at times, been quite lonely. At times you have to walk a tightrope between what is right for other families and what's right for me. More importantly however, is what is right for Tom and Sarah.\"\n\nDespite those tensions, Derek says he does not have any regrets about the past few years - but says he cannot answer for Harry's parents, who might feel differently.\n\n\"When I started investigating what was going on with Harry, it was very much like peeling back an onion. 'Hang on a minute, that can't be right, that doesn't add up.' Ever since I was a small kid, justice has been so important to me.\n\n\"What I found was that, up to that point, no-one had ever joined the dots. And that's so important. I think this had to happen, someone had to do it. There will be families before us that wish they did it. We will be saving a level of families after us.\"\n\nBut it was not just other families who had not joined the dots - lawyers raising repeated individual clinical negligence cases against the trust, charities offering bereavement support, as well as NHS regulators, all failed to see what was happening.\n\nFor a skilled, determined, campaigner like Derek - who has spent so much time pushing forward, lobbying and cajoling - it can sometimes be difficult for him to see how far he has come and how much he has achieved.\n\nThe trust has, after all, offered a fulsome apology for its actions in relation to Harry, admitting in June 2021 it had \"failed\" his parents. While it acknowledged it had more to do, the trust also said at the time that it had more doctors and better training. And it has of course had to expose itself to a team of experts crawling over its maternity services.\n\nIn his garden in rural Kent, I ask Derek if he has had time to reflect on his achievements. He looks away and, for the first time, struggles to answer. His voice breaks, he sniffles slightly. \"I would like to think that we as a family have done Harry proud,\" he says eventually. \"And that I've done Tom and Sarah proud.\"\n\nEvacuees with soldiers boarding an evacuation flight in Sudan\n\nThe final UK evacuation flight has now left Sudan, the government has announced.\n\nIt had said previously the last flight would leave on Wednesday, with British officials who have been working on the evacuation expected to be on board.\n\nAn update by the Foreign Office said the last flight had left Port Sudan and that no more would be running.\n\nThe airlift - which began amid a tentative ceasefire last week - has seen more than 2,300 people rescued.\n\nThose taken to safety included Britons, their dependents, Sudanese NHS staff and other eligible nationalities.\n\nA renewed 72-hour ceasefire was due to end at midnight local time on Wednesday. The Foreign Office had warned that, following the end of the agreement, violence in the country could escalate.\n\nDozens of people were evacuated on flights that left Sudan on Wednesday.\n\nThe country - the third largest in Africa - was plunged into crisis after fighting broke out between rival military factions on 15 April.\n\nHundreds have been killed, according to official figures, but it is feared the actual death toll is much higher, and tens of thousands have already been displaced in a growing humanitarian crisis.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK's focus would shift to providing humanitarian aid, though he warned that any continuing conflict was likely to impede relief efforts.\n\n\"We have given aid to Sudan, we are giving support to countries in the region, we will continue to push for an extension of the ceasefire and a permanent end to the conflict because that is the best way to maximise the effectiveness of our humanitarian support,\" he said.\n\nForeign Office advice for British nationals still hoping to leave Sudan is that unscheduled chartered ships will be operating from Port Sudan to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt also states that British Embassy staff remain temporarily available on the Egyptian side of the Egypt-Sudan border to provide support.\n\nThe UK government joined

Suella Braverman said this would \"clearly define\" when police can step in to stop \"selfish\" protesters \"wreaking havoc in people's everyday lives\".\n\nThe legislation will have to be approved by the Commons and Lords before it takes effect, a process that normally takes several weeks.\n\nIt follows government efforts to beef up broader police powers to tackle protests in the Public Order Bill, which recently passed through Parliament and will become law shortly.\n\nMinisters tried to ban slow walking protests by adding measures to the bill in the Lords, but were narrowly defeated by peers.\n\nBecause of the way the measures were introduced, they could not be added back to the bill at a later stage.\n\nThe bill creates a new criminal offence for people who try to lock themselves to objects or buildings.\n\nThe government says it will allow the police to more effectively tackle \"disruptive and dangerous\" tactics used by protesters, but it has been heavily criticised by civil rights groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk described the legislation as \"deeply troubling\".\n\nIt imposed restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly that were \"neither necessary nor proportionate\", he said.\n\nBJ Harrington, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for public order and public safety, said: \"Policing is not anti-protest, but there is a difference between protest and criminal activism, and we are committed to responding quickly and effectively to activists who deliberately disrupt people's lives through dangerous, reckless and criminal acts.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of Parliament to make the law and our job to enforce it.\"\n\nComplaints from students in England and Wales about their university courses reached a record high last year.\n\nMore than a third of the 2,763 complaints to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) were related to the impact of pandemic.\n\nThe amount of compensation given to students exceeded \u00a31.3m, it said.\n\nA report suggested that staffing issues, industrial action, and delays in submitting complaints from 2020 were behind the high figures.\n\nAs a result of the Covid pandemic \"some students found that they weren't getting the learning experiences that they reasonably expected\" said the OIA.\n\nIt said this explained in part why the total number of complaints submitted in 2021 was 6% higher than the year before.\n\nBy far the largest category were complaints about how courses were delivered.\n\nSome students complained about being unable to access in-person facilities like laboratories, while others were unable to pursue their studies abroad.\n\nMany complained about staffing issues, including poorly prepared substitute teachers and key experts in their field leaving the university.\n\nThe increased dependence on remote learning was also an issue, with many highlighting technical failures affecting their learning.\n\n\"Some students struggled with digital literacy, especially in online timed exams,\" the report added. \"For others their limited typing skills affected their performance.\"\n\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) said \"digital poverty\" was a big issue for some students and many others were struggling financially - with some using food banks and buy-now-pay-later loans for support.\n\nAn NUS official said the high number of complaints was \"no surprise\" and students were \"at breaking point\".\n\nComplaints in the report that were considered \"justified\", at least in part, include:\n\nOne case that resulted in just over \u00a368,000 worth of compensation, the highest figure that was awarded, the report said.\n\nBut other students found the move to remote education had made learning easier, with disabled students benefiting in particular.\n\n\"Students told us that they valued having more control over how and when they could access their learning experience,\" the OIA said.\n\nIn addition to the high number of total complaints, the OIA said the compensation awarded was \"significantly higher\" than previous years.\n\nIt suggested this may have been because the pandemic sometimes made it challenging to find practical solutions to complaints.\n\nPhD and postgraduate students were overrepresented in the complaint logs, submitting just under half of them despite accounting for 27% of the English and Welsh student population.\n\nResponding to the report, Universities UK said the high number of complaints was concerning but stressed it represented only \"a small fraction of the total student population\".\n\nThe organisation, which represents universities, said its members had responded well to the highly disruptive impact of Covid.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of students continue to receive a world-class education,\" it said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Karen Rogers has had to wear a prosthetic breast for six years after surgery delays\n\nA breast cancer survivor has said she feels \"cast aside\" due to reconstructive surgery being postponed three times this year.\n\nKaren Rogers, 57, from Magor, Monmouthshire, was given a mastectomy six years ago, but delays mean she is still waiting.\n\nShe said the wait affects everything from the clothes she wears to the way she hugs people.\n\nThe Welsh government said some cancer services were taking longer to recover.\n\nMs Rogers said: \"I know it's a lump of flesh and there are people going through far worse things.\"\n\n\"But I just want to look normal. It won't be a normal boob when I get it - it'll be lumpy and bumpy - but it will be mine. I'll be back to some sort of the old Karen.\"\n\nMs Rogers's surgery was already delayed several times before the three postponements in 2023.\n\nAfter the mastectomy on her left breast in December 2016, reconstruction was deferred until after cancer treatment.\n\nShe then needed stomach surgery to rule out a specific growth, and once she recovered, the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\n\nProsthetic breasts can help women disguise the surgery they've had following a mastectomy, but don't always stay in position\n\nThe surgery, known as deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP), is only performed in one Welsh health board - Swansea Bay - and takes skin from the stomach to create a new breast.\n\nOperations deferred by the Covid pandemic restarted last year.\n\nBut a planned nurses' strike, concerns over Ms Rogers's white blood cell count and another patient needing an immediate reconstruction has led to more waiting.\n\nWhile she said priority must be given to cancer patients, she said she felt \"cast aside\".\n\nShe has worn a prosthetic for the past six and a half years, either stuck to her skin \"like a big plaster\" or placed in a pocket of special bras.\n\n\"I don't swim any more - I've got two little grandsons my daughter wants me to go swimming with, but I can't. I'm just too self-conscious.\"\n\nEven her hugs are done from the right side, she said, because she does not want people to notice the \"rock-solid\" prosthetic on the left.\n\nJo Woolnough decided to pay for the second stage of her breast surgery rather than wait three to four years\n\nJo Woolnough, 44, from Swansea, waited four years for her breast construction, which she had in August 2022.\n\nShe said: \"You try and get on with your life and you console yourself by thinking 'well I'm here, I'm lucky I survived' but after a while you can't hold on to that anymore because that lack of a breast affects you so strongly.\"\n\nBut the reconstruction left her with one side at a C-cup and the other at an F to an E-cup, leading her to feel self-conscious and stuffing \"teddy-bear filling\" in her bra.\n\nShe was then told it would be another three to four years for a reduction of her surviving breast so they would be the same size, which she described as \"soul destroying\".\n\n\"I was so elated from having the first surgery and thinking 'I'm nearly done, I'm nearly finished. I can see the end in sight'.\"\n\nShe decided to spend \u00a38,000 to have the reduction privately, but after moving from a well-paid job to universal credit, this was a tough decision.\n\nShe said: \"We need to close the door and move on - our family needs this.\"\n\n", "PPL": 0.65362149477005, "PPL/lower": 0.7735317042959213, "PPL/zlib": 0.00017255055300159717, "Min-5%": 4.935451119553809, "Min-10%": 3.7725737141627893, "Min-20%": 2.615808042745427, "Min-30%": 1.977499135154078, "Min-40%": 1.5706005818176385, "Min-50%": 1.288929372173775, "Min-60%": 1.0846867425767674}, {"text": "performance, Finland\u2019s Krista Siegfrids revealed her song Marry Me was a proposal to another woman by kissing her female backing singer.

generation\".\n\nColumnist E Jean Carroll alleges Mr Trump assaulted her in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s.\n\nMr Trump has consistently denied her accusation, calling it \"fiction\".\n\nA judge on Monday denied a request from Mr Trump's legal team for a mistrial.\n\nThe civil rape and defamation trial began last week in a federal court in New York City.\n\nMs Carroll took the stand for the third time on Monday, facing another round of questioning from Mr Trump's attorneys, who pressed her on why she did not report the alleged assault to the police.\n\n\"I was born in 1943,\" Ms Carroll said. \"Women like me were taught and trained to keep our chins up and to not complain.\"\n\nMs Carroll added that she was ashamed of the alleged assault and had believed it to be her fault.\n\nHer testimony came moments after a judge on Monday denied a request from Mr Trump's legal team for a mistrial.\n\nIn an 18-page letter filed filed early this week in the New York City federal court, Mr Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina accused US District Judge Lewis Kaplan of making \"pervasive unfair and prejudicial\" rulings in the trial.\n\nHe claimed there had been \"numerous examples\" of \"unfair treatment by the Court, most of which has been witnessed by the Jury\".\n\nMr Trump is not required to testify in the trial, and his lawyers have implied he is unlikely to appear before the court.\n\nMs Carroll spent much of last week giving her account of the alleged assault and later being cross-examined by Mr Trump's lawyers.\n\nIn the request for mistrial, Mr Tacopina argued the judge had \"shut down\" his lines of questioning, including when he asked Ms Carroll why she did not seek to retrieve security camera footage from the store or scream during the alleged assault.\n\nThe request asked the judge to allow Mr Trump's lawyers more \"latitude to cross-examine [Ms Carroll] and her witnesses\".\n\nMs Carroll, 79, says the attack occurred at a Bergdorf Goodman store in late 1995 or early 1996.\n\nShe says she and Mr Trump bumped into each other while shopping and alleges he later assaulted her in one of the store's changing rooms.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Tacopina questioned why Ms Carroll continued to return to the Bergdorf Goodman store several times after the alleged assault.\n\n\"Bergdorf's is not a place I'm afraid to enter,\" she said.\n\nMr Trump, who is running in the 2024 presidential election, has repeatedly denied Ms Carroll's allegations.\n\nA former columnist for Elle magazine, Ms Carroll was able to bring the civil case against Mr Trump after New York passed the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\n\nThe act allowed a one-year period for victims to file sexual assault lawsuits in the state over claims that would have normally exceeded

used against them.\n\nWomen's rights have been increasingly restricted since Taliban rulers returned to power in 2021.\n\nAround 50 women took part in the protest on Wednesday, according to AFP news agency.\n\nThe Taliban have given businesses one month from 2 July to close thousands of beauty salons across the country.\n\nThey said the wearing of wigs and the practice of eyebrow-plucking were against Islamic values and parents were wasting money on beauty parlours when couples get married.\n\nThe decision further restricts the spaces accessible to Afghan women, who are already barred from classrooms, gyms and parks. More recently, the Taliban also banned them from working for the United Nations.\n\nThe closure of all beauty salons will lead to the loss of 60,000 jobs, Afghanistan's chamber of commerce said.\n\nBeauty salons were last shut when the Taliban ruled between 1996 and 2001.

In the Cerrado, which is the centre of agricultural production, there was a 6% increase in tree loss.\n\nWildfires ranged in Canada throughout 2023, pushing up global tree losses\n\nColombia also saw a significant decline with primary forest loss down by almost half compared to 2022.\n\nObservers say the actions of President Gustavo Petro Urrego have played an important role in the fall.\n\n\"The story of deforestation in Colombia is complex and deeply intertwined with the country's politics, which makes 2023's historic decrease particularly powerful,\" said Alejandra Laina, from WRI, Colombia.\n\n\"There is no doubt that recent government action and the commitment of the communities has had a profound impact on Colombia's forests, and we encourage those involved in current peace talks to use this data as a springboard to accelerate further progress.\"\n\nBut elsewhere the picture on tree loss remains poor.\n\nBolivia saw a record loss for the third year in a row with numbers up 27% on 2022. Around half of this was down to fires, as hot weather saw fires started by humans spread into forests.\n\nThere were also notable upticks in Laos and Nicaragua, mainly due to agricultural expansion.\n\nA worker harvesting Brazil nuts in Bolivia where the expansion of agriculture and wildfire has seen tree losses rise rapidly\n\nIndonesia also saw an increase in losses, but the rate remains historically low compared to a decade ago.\n\nResearchers say the overall picture is decidedly mixed, and they point to the fact that the world has just six years left to keep a promise to halt deforestation, made in 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow.\n\n\"This report appropriately challenges us to balance despair and hope at the same time,\" said Dr. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund.\n\n\"The alarmingly high rates of global deforestation remind us how badly off track we are in solving the climate and nature crises.\"\n\nFox chairman Rupert Murdoch (left, with son Lachlan) could have had to testify\n\nFox News has settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting machine company, Dominion, over its reporting of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a last-minute settlement before trial, the network agreed to pay $787.5m (\u00a3634m) - about half of the $1.6bn initially sought by Dominion.\n\nDominion argued its business was harmed by Fox spreading false claims the vote had been rigged against Donald Trump.\n\nThe deal spares Fox executives such as Rupert Murdoch from having to testify.\n\nThe judge in the case is not required to give his approval for the agreement.\n\nFox said Tuesday's settlement in one of the most anticipated defamation trials in recent US history reflected its \"commitment to the highest journalistic standards\".\n\nThe Fox statement added without elaborating that the network \"acknowledges the court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false\".\n\nDominion chief executive John Poulos told a press conference the deal included Fox \"admitting to telling lies, causing enormous damage to my company\".\n\n\"Lies have consequences,\" he added. \"Over two years ago a torrent of lies swept Dominion and election officials across America into an alternative universe of conspiracy theories, causing grievous harm to Dominion and the country.\"\n\nMr Nelson added that for \"democracy to endure\", Americans must \"share a commitment to facts\".\n\nOpening arguments in the case had been due to start on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe announcement of a settlement came after an unexplained delay of several hours once jury selection had finished, prompting speculation that talks were under way behind the scenes.\n\nOn Monday, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced that the start of the trial would be delayed by 24 hours.\n\nAlthough he gave no reason, US media reported that it was to give both sides an opportunity to reach a settlement.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, however, both sides appeared to be digging in for a lengthy trial.\n\nAttorneys for Fox had repeatedly objected to the $1.6bn in damages sought by Colorado-based Dominion, characterising the figure as massively inflated.\n\nThe \"real cost\" of the case, Fox had argued, would be the \"cherished\" rights to freedom of speech and of the press enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\n", "PPL": 0.6374065279960632, "PPL/lower": 0.7545762192820104, "PPL/zlib": 0.00017264532177574843, "Min-5%": 5.659295414008346, "Min-10%": 4.220344267639459, "Min-20%": 2.823729410731122, "Min-30%": 2.0471221723075024, "Min-40%": 1.5778440433055672, "Min-50%": 1.2713771891777466, "Min-60%": 1.0616538545681036}, {"text": "played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The campaign provided instructions on how to contact the CIA on the dark web without being monitored.\n\nThis video gained 2.5 million views in the first week.\n\nDirector Burns also reiterated the message other US officials have previously made in public that the US had no part in Prigozhin's mutiny.\n\nHe did not directly address recent reports in the Washington Post that he made a secret visit to the Ukrainian capital before the mutiny.\n\nIt was reported that discussions included the possibility that progress in Ukraine's counter-offensive might open the way for negotiations from a position of greater strength if substantial territory was taken.\n\nMr Burns - who previously served as the US Ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 - said spending much of the last two decades trying to understand Russian President Putin had given him a \"healthy dose of humility about pontificating about Putin and Russia\".\n\nBut he added that one thing that he had learnt was that it was always a mistake to underestimate Mr Putin's fixation on controlling Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader believed that without Ukraine, Russia could not be a major power and Mr Putin himself could not be a great leader, he said.\n\n\"That tragic and brutish fixation has already brought shame to Russia and exposed its weaknesses,\" Mr Burns said.\n\n\"Putin's war has already been a strategic failure for Russia: its military weaknesses laid bare, its economy badly damaged for years to come, its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes.\"\n\nTurning to China, the CIA boss said it would be foolish for the US to attempt to decouple because of the deep economic interdependence between the two countries.\n\n\"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so,\" he said.\n\nThe US should instead \"sensibly de-risk and diversify by securing resilient supply chains, protecting our technological edge and investing in industrial capacity\", he added.\n\nThe search warrant was granted a week after Mr Yousaf succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader\n\nScotland's first minister has said there was nothing unusual in the timing of a warrant to search his predecessor's home.\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday that police", "PPL": 0.43851426243782043, "PPL/lower": 0.6076722054200997, "PPL/zlib": 0.00011169492166016822, "Min-5%": 4.847822175306432, "Min-10%": 3.432277834298564, "Min-20%": 2.0804842485338084, "Min-30%": 1.444235756580721, "Min-40%": 1.0926562817687662, "Min-50%": 0.8761652234270514, "Min-60%": 0.7311376703719924}, {"text": "ound embarrassment that only after what regretfully happened did I learn of the antiquity of the monument.\"\n\nHe said that he praised those who \"guard the inestimable historical and artistic value of the Colosseum with dedication, care and sacrifice\".\n\nHe added: \"I am also aware of the fact that a similar conduct, in my country, would result in far more serious consequences.\n\n\"For this reason I assume all responsibility and I will sincerely and concretely commit myself to redeem and remedy the mistake I made.\n\n\"The incivility, superficiality and thoughtlessness with which I acted, damaging the Colosseum to the detriment of anyone who legitimately wishes to admire and enjoy it, have no justification.\"\n\nThe lawyer for Mr Dimitrov, Alexandro Maria Tirelli, told the BBC: \"We have already formulated a plea bargain request.\n\n\"The boy will certainly benefit from a suspended sentence, the fact is heinous but not serious.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old man was filmed by another visitor who verbally reprimanded him before handing the recording to security officials.\n\nA video of the scene was uploaded on to YouTube and shared across social media.\n\nIf convicted of an offence, he could face a fine of up to 15,000 euros (\u00a312,500) as well as a prison sentence of between two and five years.\n\nMr Dimitrov's lawyer told Il Messaggero newspaper that it is hoped the letter will help his client avoid the harshest sentence.\n\nThe Colosseum is one of the best-known symbols of Imperial Rome, and Italy's most popular tourist site.\n\nIt is a protected Unesco World Heritage Site, meaning it is considered to be a place of \"outstanding universal value\".\n\nThe incident prompted widespread condemnation in Italy and across the globe.\n\nItalian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said it \"was offensive to everyone around the world who appreciates the value of archaeology, monuments and history\".\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller was told a bank account for her political party would close without explanation.\n\nMonzo initially refused to tell Ms Miller why her \"True and Fair\" party account would be closed in September.\n\nAfter the BBC contacted the bank about the case, it said it did not allow political party accounts and had made a mistake in allowing it to be opened.\n\nMonzo said it recognised the experience would have been \"frustrating for the customer and we're sorry for that\".\n\nMs Miller is a businesswoman who came to public attention after twice leading successful attempts to challenge the government's handling of Brexit. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in her favour, finding that Boris Johnson had unlawfully suspended Parliament.\n\nQuestions over so-called \"debanking\" have increased in recent weeks following the well-publicised case of former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nMr Farage obtained documents which revealed that his political views had been discussed by Coutts bank in their decision to close his account.\n\nThe fallout from the row has led to both the boss of NatWest, which owns Coutts, and the chief executive of Coutts stepping down from their positions.\n\nMs Miller said a number of banks had turned down an application for her political party to open a bank account.\n\nShe did successfully open an account with Monzo in November 2021.\n\nHowever, earlier this month, Ms Miller received an email from the bank which read: \"Unfortunately we can't tell you why we're closing your account.\n\n\"We can't share the specific reason for closing your account. As a bank we regularly review and sometimes close accounts as part of our legal and regulatory responsibilities.\"\n\nAfter the BBC contacted Monzo about the case - with Ms Miller's permission - the bank did provide an explanation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the bank said: \"Like lots of banks, we do not accept any political parties as Monzo Business customers in the same way that we don't currently accept trusts, clubs and a range of other organisations.\n\n\"In this case, the account wasn't originally categorised as a political party.\n\n\"After this was identified and corrected, the customer was given notice that the account would be closed. We recognise that this experience will have been frustrating for the customer and we're sorry for that.\"\n\nMs Miller said the difficulty in accessing banking facilities was a problem.\n\n\"The government has to step in,\" she told the BBC. \"We do not have a functioning democracy if you cannot access a bank account.\"\n\nDespite their differences over Brexit, Mr Farage tweeted his support, saying: \"This is just plain wrong at every level. I stand with @thatginamiller.\"\n\nFormer cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, another prominent Brexiteer, said Ms Miller's case showed \"there is something rotten in the state of British banking\".\n\nThe government has been critical of NatWest after Mr Farage lost his bank account and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said nobody should lose their bank account because of legally held political views.\n\nThere is no suggestion Ms Miller's political views were involved in this case - but she has sought more information from the bank.\n\nThe closure of Mr Farage's account has triggered a wider debate about banking\n\nOther politicians and campaigners have also struggled to open bank accounts - in July, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the Financial Times he believed he had been blocked from opening an account because of his public role.\n\nThe government is planning reforms which would mean banks have to give people three months' notice of bank account closures - and a full explanation of the reasons.\n\nMinisters are also looking into the enforcement of rules around Politically Exposed Persons - a financial category which means political figures face more stringent checks.\n\nSomeone classed as a PEP is seen to present a higher risk for financial institutions as they are deemed to be more exposed to potential involvement in bribery and corruption.\n\nCity minister Andrew Griffith said earlier this week in a letter: \"The government is clear that domestic PEPs should be treated in a manner which is in line with their risk, and that banks should not be closing individuals' accounts solely due to their status as a PEP.\"\n\nA cleaner destroyed decades of \"groundbreaking\" work by shutting off a lab freezer containing key samples over an \"annoying\" alarm sound, US lawyers have claimed.\n\nA sign explained how to mute the beep, but a breaker was reportedly switched off after a reading error.\n\nSamples stored at -80C (-112F) were left \"unsalvageable\", causing $1m in damages, lawyers said.\n\nThe lab's school is suing the cleaner's employer for improper training.\n\nThe company held a $1.4m (\u00a31.1m) contract to clean the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York back in 2020 which is when the alleged incident happened, paper Times Union reported.\n\nResearch on photosynthesis, headed by Prof KV Lakshmi, had the potential to be \"ground-breaking\" in furthering solar panel development, a lawyer for the institute wrote.\n\nA few days before the freezer was turned off, an alarm went off to alert a 3C temperature rise.

It is currently at 10.1%.\n\nHowever, some economists have previously said that inflation is due to fall naturally as energy and commodity prices ease, rather than due to specific government policies.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said there were \"good reasons to expect inflation to fall sharply over the coming months\", starting with figures for April which are due to be released next week.\n\nBut he said the UK was experiencing \"second-round\" effects of inflation, highlighting that price setting by companies and wage rises were fuelling inflation in part.\n\n\"And as headline inflation falls, these second-round effects are unlikely to go away as quickly as they appeared,\" he said.\n\nThe Bank is responsible for setting interest rates and keeping inflation at around 2%.\n\nLast week, the Bank warned soaring food costs would mean prices will remain higher for longer, as it raised interest rates for the 12th time in a row. to 4.5% in the battle to slow inflation.\n\nBy raising rates, the Bank expects people to have less money to spend and buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly.\n\nHowever, it also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand.\n\nGlasgow City Council is having to hire vehicles because some of its own fleet does not meet new rules on emissions.\n\nMore than 600 of its vehicles are not allowed inside the city's Low Emission Zone (LEZ) introduced last week.\n\nThe council said only a small number of the non-compliant vehicles were required to enter the zone but they include all its uplift trucks used for parking enforcement.\n\nThe GMB union said the cost of hiring vehicles was a waste of resources.\n\nOf the 1,615 vehicles owned by Glasgow City council, 616 are non-compliant meaning they are no longer allowed inside the council's new LEZ.\n\nA spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council told the BBC: \"New LEZ compliant vehicles are expected to be delivered to us in the near future and we are also retrofitting existing vehicles to improve emissions standards across our fleet.\n\n\"LEZ compliant vehicles have been hired in the short term to ensure emissions standards are met and this will allow older vehicles to be taken out of service in line with our ongoing fleet replacement programme.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added the LEZ was crucial to improving air quality in the city centre.\n\nThe council's fleet includes a variety of cars, buses, lorries and vans used by to carry out various aspects of council business.\n\nAmong the non-complaint vehicles is a limousine used to by the council's Lord Provost, according to the Scottish Daily Express.\n\nThe LEZ covers an area from the M8 motorway to the north and west of Glasgow, the River Clyde to the south, and the Saltmarket/High Street to the east.\n\nThe restrictions were introduced last week but similar restrictions have been in place for buses and heavy good vehicles since 2018.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Scotland's Drivetime, Chris Mitchell from the GMB union said the council \"should have thought of this a long time ago\".\n\nMr Mitchell, who works as a refuse collector for the council said: \"The majority of the vehicles I deal with are non-complaint for the LEZ because they are the best part of 15 years old and obviously we still need to provide a service within the city centre.\n\n\"Unfortunately they've had to hire in a number of vehicles at a pretty penny, at a cost to the council - well, at a cost to the taxpayer.\"\n\nMr Mitchell said the types of vehicles being hired were \"small flat-bed\" vehicles, used for collecting rubbish.\n\nThe Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said no new bin lorries had been hired to meet LEZ requirements although some lorries were hired under a pre-existing arrangement.\n\nShe was unable to provide a figure at this time for the cost of hiring replacement vehicles.\n\nAustralia will fast track plans to acquire the US HIMARS system.\n\nAustralia will speed up efforts to buy longer range missiles to counter the growing threat from China, a major defence review says.\n\nIt warns the country can no longer be protected by its geographic isolation in the \"missile age\".\n\nThe government will spend some A$19bn ($12bn, \u00a310bn) to deliver the report's immediate recommendations.\n\nThe 110-page study is described as the biggest overhaul of Australian defence since World War Two.\n\nThe Defence Strategic Review (DSR) comes amid increasing regional tension over China's stance towards Taiwan, which it has repeatedly vowed to take by force if necessary.\n\nThe Chinese navy has also established a major presence in the South China Sea, claiming parts of it as its own territory, contrary to international law.\n\n\"China's military build-up is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the Second World War. This build up is occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China's strategic intent,\" the report states.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the review would \"shape the future rather than waiting for the future to shape us\", and its recommendations would make Australia \"more self-reliant, more prepared and more secure\".\n\nIt recommends that Australia's armed forces switch focus from land-based armour to \"longer-range strike capability, with munitions built in Australia\", Defence Minister Richard Marles said.\n\n\"We need to have a defence force which has the capacity to engage in 'impactful projection',\" Mr Marles told reporters.\n\nThe minister said the acquisition of \"precision strike missiles\" with ranges in excess of 500km (310 miles) would give the army \"the firepower and mobility it needs into the future\".\n\nA 2022 think tank report warned of a \"worst-case scenario\" for Australia's military where China took control of territory in the near region during a possible war over Taiwan.\n\nAnd Australia's new defence posture was aimed at keeping \"a major power adversary like China... as far away as possible\", said Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) analyst Dr Malcolm Davis.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is to deter China from using force to achieve its policy objectives, including Taiwan or in the South China Sea. So it is about deterrence. But of course, deterrence can fail, as we saw with Ukraine, so you then have to be ready to respond. What we're investing in will dramatically extend our combat reach,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that while the review was a \"step in the right direction\", it was not a complete solution.\n\n\"We're going down the path of a focused force, designed for impactful projection, that is better suited to the sort of threat that we're facing in this decade and beyond, rather than [one] which tries to do everything.

Around two-thirds are BMA members.\n\nDr Hanna, who is interim head of the trust's Evelina London Children's Hospital, said up to half of all planned treatments could be cancelled as the trust redeployed its senior doctors - and this is on top of the impact of postponements during previous walkouts.\n\nShe said the cumulative impact of this was particularly problematic for children who are growing and developing.\n\nNHS Providers, which represents health managers, said such concerns were widespread.\n\nChief executive Sir Julian Hartley said: \"It's clear from our extensive dialogue with trust leaders that we are in uncharted territory.\n\n\"We need a solution to prevent further strikes and we need it now.\"\n\nThe organisation also released a series of statements provided by hospital chief executives.\n\nOne warned: \"This is less about what planned routine work gets pulled down and everything about maintenance of safety in emergency departments, acute medicine and surgery.

Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible.

After a few weeks loitering on the fringes of Antarctica, it\u2019s begun to drift at pace once more.\n\nA23a, as it\u2019s known, broke away from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but it's only recently begun a big migration.\n\nFor more than 30 years, it was stuck rigidly in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea like a static \"ice island\". A 350m-deep keel had anchored it in place.\n\nIt took gradual melting until 2020 to allow the berg to re-float and start moving again, slowly at first, before currents and winds then swept it north towards warmer air and waters.\n\nA23a is now following a path that exports so much of Antarctica's floating ice - what scientists refer to as \"iceberg alley\".\n\nIt\u2019s a path to destruction. It's going to fragment and melt to nothing in just a matter of months.\n\nToday, the behemoth is drifting along the 60th Parallel, close to the South Orkney Islands, about 700km (430 miles) northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nThe process of decay is already evident in satellite imagery and close-up photos taken from visiting ships.\n\nEvery day, large chunks are falling off into the sea.\n\nA23a is surrounding itself with an armada of off-cuts - of football-pitch-sized \"bergy bits\" and lorry-sized \"growlers\".\n\nThe interplay of winds, ocean fronts and eddies will determine A23a's precise course over the coming weeks but many of these giant, flat-topped - or tabular - bergs end up passing by South Georgia, roughly 650km (400 miles) north-east of its present position.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory, it seems, is where a lot of icebergs go to die.\n\nThe size of A23a can be hard to fully comprehend.\n\nWhen scientists working on the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 mission used a radar altimeter on the spacecraft to estimate the iceberg\u2019s girth, they found it to have an average thickness of just over 280m (920ft). For comparison, the Shard in London, the tallest skyscraper in western Europe, is 310m (1,020ft) tall.\n\nEven sailing right up to its 30m-high cliff face wouldn't really let you grasp its scale - no more than standing in front of the facade of Buckingham Palace would let you gauge the size of London.\n\nAlthough its size is reducing with every passing day, the huge iceberg is still about 3,800 sq km (1,500 sq miles) - larger than 29 countries, including Luxembourg, Bahrain and Singapore.\n\nEnergetic waves are cutting into the berg's walls, sculpting enormous caves and arches, which are collapsing to expose wide terraces of submerged ice.\n\nBuoyancy is then forcing these terraces up to the surface, ripping away the edges of the berg in the process.\n\nBut warmer air also is gradually taking its toll.\n\nMeltwater will be collecting at the berg's surface, trickling down into cracks and forcing the fissures deeper and deeper until they break all the way to the bottom.\n\nThere may come an end point later this year when what remains of A23a simply lets go in one catastrophic moment to become a sloppy mush.\n\nA23a will have its legacy", "PPL": 0.4935906231403351, "PPL/lower": 0.6809162345918532, "PPL/zlib": 0.00013966910671769526, "Min-5%": 5.080651739064385, "Min-10%": 3.569500959971372, "Min-20%": 2.225449357901342, "Min-30%": 1.5828036761778963, "Min-40%": 1.2170981138325263, "Min-50%": 0.982542192692689, "Min-60%": 0.8214794740494923}, {"text": "care has risen by more than 12% in the past year on top of bills and the 18.2% rise in food costs.\n\nAn animal welfare charity has urged people in need to use their pet food bank.\n\nThe cost of living crisis has seen more pets being given up as families struggle to afford the cost of food and medication.\n\nBut Ms Workman, from Cardiff, said her two children and five cats are the most important things in her life.\n\nAlthough she sometimes \"really struggles with money\", she says she would \"rather starve than give [her] cats away\".\n\nMs Workman, who is unemployed, said she has been \"helped tremendously\" by a pet food bank at times when she's had to skip meals to ensure her family and pets were fed.\n\n\"Sometimes, I'll feed my daughter and go without and make sure I've got food for the cats,\" she said.\n\nThe price of pet care - including pet food - has risen by 12.6% in the last year, according to latest consumer price inflation (CPI) figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in the costs of keeping pets\n\n\"I got these animals because I wanted them.

Jamala, who is herself a Crimean Tartar, appeared to confirm the link when she told the press: \"The main message is to remember and to know this story. When we know, we prevent.\"\n\nOn the path to victory, her song picked up several important votes from former Soviet countries who have traditionally voted for Russia.

According to the lawyer, Italian judges allowed Mr Cozzolino to stay at home because he has heart problems - and Mr Conte does not believe he would receive proper care in a Belgian prison.\n\nThe lawyer cited a 2022 Council of Europe report which highlighted \"overcrowding\" and \"clearly insufficient\" health services in four Belgian prisons, four years after the body called for Belgium to improve conditions for inmates, particularly at times when prison staff are on strike.\n\nBut Alberto Alemanno, professor of EU law at HEC Paris, dismissed Mr Conte's allegations as \"fictitious\". He accused him of \"leveraging the health status of Mr Cozzolino in order to somehow tarnish... a very difficult investigation across Europe\", arguing they were a delaying tactic.\n\n\"[These allegations] sound very useful to satisfy the private interest of an individual who is currently suspected of major breaches of the rule of law,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMarc Tarabella, Eva Kaili, Pier Antonio Panzeri and Andrea Cozzolino are the four current and former MEPs wrapped up in Qatargate\n\nMr Alemanno described European Arrest Warrants as the \"bread and butter\" of European justice, and said Mr Cozzolino's attempts to challenge it were \"very unusual\" - adding that the Belgian investigation so far into the corruption allegations had been \"extremely thorough\", and that Belgian prisons compared favourably with others around Europe.\n\n\"[The prosecutors] are following the rules of the game, which basically stem from the European Court of Human Rights case law,\" he said.\n\n\"We're seeing a bit of a David and Goliath situation in which the Belgian authorities seem to find a lot of pushback from the political system, from the institutional system, and from third countries at the origin of this case.\"\n\nAfter the interview with Mr Conte the BBC sent all his allegations to the prosecutor's office in Belgium that is leading the investigation. A spokesman for the prosecutor twice refused to comment.\n\nThe BBC has also reached out to the Belgian prison service for comment but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe investigation began in December when Greek MEP Eva Kaili was arrested along with three others on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering. She denies the charges.\n\nA Financial Times article says on the day of her arrest Ms Kaili stuffed \u20ac300,000 ($326,000; \u00a3264,000) into a suitcase along with nappies and baby food for her daughter. The two-year-old child is now only allowed to visit her jailed mother twice a month.\n\nThe police have seized \u20ac1.5m in cash since the start of the investigation, in raids across Belgium, Italy and France.\n\nSince then two more MEPs - Mr Cozzolino and Belgian politician Marc Tarabella - have had their legal immunity stripped by the European Parliament. Mr Tarabella, who also denies wrongdoing, is now in a Belgian prison awaiting trial.\n\nBelgian police have released pictures of the cash seized in December's raids\n\nInvestigators believe a criminal network took bribes from Qatar and Morocco in return for influencing the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nFormer Italian MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri allegedly led that network. He later agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors - agreeing to reveal everything about the scheme in exchange for a reduced sentence of one year in custody. Charges against his wife and daughter were also dropped as part of that agreement, and Mr Panzeri has since moved to house arrest.\n\nThe BBC has seen leaked transcripts from interviews that investigators held with Mr Panzeri in February.\n\nAccording to these documents, the former politician told them that Qatar donated \u20ac250,000 each to Mr Cozzolino and Ms Kaili for their electoral campaigns.\n\nHe also allegedly said Francesco Giorgi - who worked as a parliamentary assistant for Mr Cozzolino, and who is the partner of Ms Kaili - distributed the Qatari cash.\n\nMr Giorgi has reportedly confessed to acting as the bag man for the network. On his LinkedIn page, he lists himself as co-founder of the NGO Fight Impunity - a group set up by Mr Panzeri in 2019 to promote human rights.\n\nFight Impunity shares a Brussels office building with another group, named No Peace Without Justice. Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca, the secretary general of the latter NGO, was initially arrested by investigators but was then released in February.

However, he was already ordered to sign the register for life when he returned to the UK after he was found guilty of sexually abusing two young girls in Vietnam in 2006.\n\nGadd had been at the height of his fame when he attacked two girls aged 12 and 13 after inviting them backstage to his dressing room.\n\nHis youngest victim had been less than 10 years old when he crept into her bed and tried to rape her in 1975.\n\nGadd had denied allegations against him but was found guilty after a trial lasting three weeks.\n\nIn 2015 at the time of sentencing, Judge McCreath said he could find \"no real evidence that\" Gadd had atoned for his crimes and described his abuse of a girl under 10 as \"appalling\".\n\nThe allegations that led to Gadd's imprisonment came to light when he became the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree - the investigation launched by the Met in 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\nGadd, who performed as Gary Glitter, had three UK number ones including I'm the Leader of the Gang (I am!).\n\nHis fall from grace began decades later in 1999 after he admitted possessing thousands of images that showed child sex abuse and was jailed for four months.\n\nUpon being freed he went abroad and in 2002 was expelled from Cambodia amid sex crime allegations.\n\nHe was later convicted of sexually abusing two young girls in neighbouring Vietnam in March 2006 and spent two-and-a-half years in jail.\n\nOn returning to the UK in 2008, he was forced to sign the sex offenders register.

In the UK, it was number one for four weeks - her longest-ever spell at the top.\n\nNashville reacted with a shrug. Country radio only gave the song modest airplay, even as millions of streams propelled it to the top of Billboard's country chart.\n\nThis was pretty much what Beyonc\u00e9 expected.\n\nAs a Texan, country music is her birth right but, in an Instagram post last week, she wrote that her new album, Cowboy Carter, was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed\".\n\nThis was likely a reference to her appearance at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where she performed her song Daddy Lessons with The Chicks (then known as the Dixie Chicks).\n\nBoth performers were deemed unwelcome - The Chicks had faced a backlash in the US after criticising former President George W Bush during the Iraq War; while Beyonc\u00e9's vocal support of Black Lives Matter had upset many on the American right.\n\nTheir performance faced a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.

One MP said students faced a \"lottery\" when it came to quality of mental health provision across the sector.\n\nMr Halfon said a statutory duty of care \"may not be the most effective intervention\" but that he was \"not closing the door on future legislation\".\n\nHe said he had written to universities asking them to sign up to the University Mental Health Charter - a set of principles developed by the charity Student Minds to help institutions prioritise mental health.\n\nMr Halfon said 61 universities had already signed up, but Universities UK (UUK) has 140 members and \"it's time the rest got on board\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm confident that higher education can meet this challenge, but I have made absolutely clear that if this response is not satisfactory I will go further and ask the Office for Students to look at the merits of a new registration condition on mental health.\"\n\nInstitutions in England need to register with the OfS in order to call themselves \"universities\", award their own degrees, access different types of funding, and recruit international students.\n\nMr Halfon also said a new taskforce would propose targets for universities and a plan to help them better identify students at risk by the end of this year, with a final report due by May 2024.\n\nAnd he said there would be a national review of university student deaths.\n\nAmong those who travelled to London for the debate were Bob and Maggie Abrahart, whose daughter Natasha took her own life at the University of Bristol, in 2018, on the day she was due to give a presentation in a large lecture theatre.\n\nNatasha had a social anxiety-disorder that made public speaking hard - and after her death, her parents sued the university over its failure to make adjustments.\n\nThey partly won their case, under the Equality Act, but the judge was not satisfied the university had owed Natasha a duty of care, saying there was \"no statute or precedent which establishes the existence of such a duty of care owed by a university to a student\".\n\nThe couple, from Nottinghamshire, said Natasha had been a \"very sweet caring person\" who really wanted to study physics at university. And they were pleased the issue, all about \"providing education safely\", was \"finally on the agenda\".\n\nBob and Maggie Abrahart, pictured with their daughter Natasha, are pleased the debate is finally on the agenda\n\nThe petition calls for the extension to all students of the existing duty of care to protect those under the age of 18, and staff, from \"reasonably foreseeable harm\" caused by direct injury or a failure to act.\n\nBut UUK says this would not be practical, proportionate or the best way to support students.\n\nSome providers may have 50,000 registered students, with most living outside the university, it said.\n\nUUK president and University of the West of England vice-chancellor Prof Steve West said he welcomed the measures set out, and that higher education providers should continue to demonstrate progress on student mental health and suicide prevention.\n\n\"University leaders recognise the profound impact that suicide has upon families, and the university community, as well as the petitioners' personal experience of loss,\" he said.\n\nBefore the debate, the Department for Education said higher education providers had a general duty of care \"to deliver educational and pastoral services\" and further legislation \"would be a disproportionate response\".\n\nUniversities are now advised to contact key family members or friends if they have serious concerns about a student's mental health - even without their permission.\n\nOfficial estimates suggest 64 students killed themselves in England and Wales in the 2019-20 academic year, a significantly lower proportion than among the general population of similar ages.\n\nBut the families say universities do not report the annual number of student suicides - and the number is higher.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues, you can visit the BBC's Action Line or contact the Samaritans.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, have been meeting crowds celebrating the King's Coronation on the Long Walk in Windsor.\n\nThousands have been taking part in street parties across the UK as part of the Coronation Big Lunch.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen is urging Congress to act 'as soon as possible'\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the US may run out of cash by 1 June if Congress fails to raise or suspend the debt ceiling.\n\nReaching the debt ceiling would mean that the government is unable to borrow any more money.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Yellen urged Congress to act \"as soon as possible\" to address the $31.4tr (\u00a325.12tr) limit.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called a meeting of congressional leaders on the issue on 9 May.\n\nThe debt ceiling has been raised, extended or revised 78 times since 1960.\n\nIn this instance, House Republicans have demanded drastic spending cuts and a reversal of some aspects of President Biden's agenda - including his student loan forgiveness programme and green energy tax credits - in exchange for votes to raise the debt ceiling. This, in turn, has prompted objections from Democrats in the Senate and from President Biden, who said last week that the issue is \"not negotiable\".\n\nThe president, however, is coming under increasing pressure from business groups - including the US Chamber of Congress - to discuss Republican proposals.\n\nA default - which would be the first in US history - could upend global financial markets and shatter trust in the US as a global business partner.\n\nExperts have warned that a default could also see the US head into a recession and lead to rising unemployment.\n\nIt would also mean that the US would be unable to borrow money to pay the salaries of government employees and military personnel, social security cheques or for other obligations, such as defence contractor payments.\n\nEven weather forecasts could ultimately be impacted, as many rely on data from the federally-funded National Weather Service.\n\nIn a letter to members of Congress on Tuesday, Ms Yellen said that \"We have learned", "PPL": 0.5717090964317322, "PPL/lower": 0.6866581237270603, "PPL/zlib": 0.00014784305571030054, "Min-5%": 5.461101457184436, "Min-10%": 3.8856238652678097, "Min-20%": 2.487063373796514, "Min-30%": 1.8056173190620124, "Min-40%": 1.4014707826923976, "Min-50%": 1.1358498593544937, "Min-60%": 0.9517962548052074}, {"text": "on his return from Libya four days before the attack.\n\nThe public inquiry also found Abedi was probably assisted by someone in Libya but it was not possible, on the available evidence, to say who this might have been.\n\nIt is the first time an official conclusion has been made about the possible involvement of other people from abroad.\n\nIn making this finding, Sir John contradicts an MI5 assessment which said no-one other than Salman Abedi and his brother Hashem were knowingly involved in the plot.\n\nTwenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion\n\nThe report also found that while Didsbury Mosque in south Manchester, where the Abedi family worshipped, was not an active factor in the brothers' radicalisation, politicisation did happen there.\n\nSir John said \"there was a form of wilful blindness\" to some activities, and \"weak leadership\".\n\nDidsbury Mosque chairman Fawzi Haffar told the BBC he disagreed with Sir John and added: \"The chairman can say whatever he wants.\n\n\"The chairman has not been to the mosque, none of the lawyers have been to the mosque, they don't know the workings of the mosque.\n\n\"I would say to him [the chairman] that they are wrong,\" Mr Haffar added.\n\nThe report concluded that the Abedi family held \"significant responsibility\" for the radicalisation of Salman and Hashem Abedi.\n\nThose family members responsible include their father Ramadan Abedi, mother Samia Tabbal and elder brother Ismail Abedi, each of whom has held extremist views, the inquiry found.\n\nBut Sir John said, other than Hashem Abedi, there was insufficient evidence to attribute specific knowledge of the attack to them.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

investigating Boris Johnson over Partygate, ahead of a hearing crucial to his political future.\n\nIncluded is evidence from the UK's top civil servant saying he did not give the former PM assurances about whether Covid rules were followed in No 10.\n\nMr Johnson has admitted he did mislead MPs over Partygate but not on purpose.\n\nHe says Wednesday's televised hearing will vindicate him.\n\nThe former PM, who was ousted from office last year after a string of scandals, faces being a potential suspension if MPs decide he deliberately misled them.\n\nThe seven-member Commons privileges committee is investigating whether what Mr Johnson told Parliament stopped it from properly holding him to account.\n\nAt 14.00 GMT on Wednesday, the committee will get its chance to question Mr Johnson live on TV, in a hearing that could last several hours.\n\nHe is expected to be flanked by members of his taxpayer-funded legal team, with whom he will be able to confer during the session.\n\nHowever, he will have to answer questions himself, and will take an oath on the King James Bible before the hearing begins.\n\nThe committee is expected to focus on statements Mr Johnson made about Downing Street gatherings on 1 December and 8 December 2021, and subsequently.\n\nBefore the hearing, the committee has published what it calls a \"core bundle\" of evidence that is expected to be referred to during the hearing.\n\nA written submission from Simon Case, the most senior civil servant in the UK, is part of the 110-page bundle of documents published on the committee's website.\n\nIt is a Q&A form, dated 6 February 2023, which asks Mr Case whether he gave Mr Johnson any assurance that \"Covid rules were followed at all times in No 10 and specifically in relation to gatherings covered in the Sue Gray report\".\n\nIn his response, Mr Case answered: \"No.\"\n\nBut evidence submitted by Conservative MP Sarah Dines appears to contradict Mr Case's answer.\n\nIn her written submission, Ms Dines said she recalled a meeting with Mr Johnson in the cabinet room, during which the former PM was advised Covid rules were followed \"at all times\".\n\nMs Dines said she was \"sure\" civil servants were present and she was \"90% sure one of them was Simon Case\".\n\nEvidence from other Number 10 officials, as well as emails, messages and details of Mr Johnson's diary have been published, alongside extracts of official advice for the public at the time of the pandemic.\n\nIn written evidence Martin Reynolds, the former principal private secretary to the then prime minister, questioned Mr Johnson's plan to say Covid guidance had been followed at all times in Downing Street.\n\nHe said he queried a line proposed for Mr Johnson to say at Prime Minister's Questions on 8 December.\n\nMr Reynolds said: \"He did not welcome the interruption but told me that he had received reassurances that the comms event was within the rules.\n\n\"I accepted this but questioned whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times, given the nature of the working environment in No 10.\"\n\nThe committee also published exchanges about a drinks party in Downing Street's garden in May 2020.\n\nIn written evidence, Lee Cain, who was then the No 10 communications director, said he raised concerns that the garden party would be a \"communications risk\".\n\nHe said he and Mr Reynolds then discussed whether to go ahead with the event. Mr Cain said Mr Reynolds said he would speak to the prime minister but \"he was sure it was okay\".\n\nMr Cain said Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser at the time, agreed the gathering \"should not take place\" and said he would \"raise the issue with Martin and the prime minister\".\n\nMr Cain said Mr Cummings later confirmed that he had \"informed the PM\", but they had argued about other issues and \"he was clearly very frustrated\".\n\nAnother submission from a No 10 official said Mr Johnson often \"saw and joined gatherings\" in Downing Street. \"He had the opportunity to shut them down, but joined in, made speeches, had a drink with staff,\" the official wrote. \"He could see what was happening and allowed the culture to continue.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Johnson's comments in the Commons on Partygate scandal\n\nAll the evidence amassed by the committee, including written statements from 23 witnesses, official diaries, and emails between officials, has already been handed over to Mr Johnson's legal team.\n\nHis lawyers have given the committee 46 WhatsApp messages between the former prime minister and five unnamed people.\n\nMedia stories about staff parties in Downing Street when Covid rules banned socialising indoors began to emerge in late 2021, later becoming known as the Partygate scandal.\n\nOn a number of occasions, Mr Johnson told the House of Commons that Covid rules and guidance had been followed in Downing Street.\n\nBut an inquiry by senior official Sue Gray later found rule-breaking had taken place at multiple events, and police issued fines to 83 people, including Mr Johnson himself, for breaching Covid laws.\n\nThe committee, chaired by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, but with a Conservative majority, said earlier this month that breaches of pandemic guidance would have been \"obvious\" to him at the time.\n\nBut that was rejected by Mr Johnson on Tuesday, in a 52-page document setting out his defence ahead of the TV hearing.\n\nHe said he did not \"intentionally or recklessly\" mislead MPs and his assurances to MPs that lockdown rules had been followed were made in \"good faith\".\n\nWales' scheme is to start in two years, after Scotland's scheme was delayed\n\nThe Welsh government intends to press on with plans for a refundable bottles and cans fee after the UK government blocked similar ones in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme is set to start in Wales in two years, but Scotland's scheme was delayed last week after Westminster said glass could not be included.\n\nThe UK government said its decision would affect Wales' plans too.\n\nClimate Change minister Julie James said she would take the UK government \"to task\".\n\nThe UK government has decided not to include glass bottles in its own deposit return scheme, and told the Scottish government it wanted glass excluded so a consistent UK-wide approach was taken.\n\nWestminster used post-Brexit legislation called the Internal Markets Bill to stop Scotland's plans.\n\nJulie James said she would take the UK government \"to task\"\n\nMs James said her reading of the UK Internal Markets Bill was that no single nation could interrupt the commerce of the others.\n\nShe said: \"It's England that's the outlier here, not Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and they need to understand that.\"\n\nUnder the Welsh government plans, people would get their money back if they returned empty drinks containers made of plastic, glass, steel or aluminium.\n\nMs James insisted the Welsh government would continue to roll out its scheme in two years.\n\n\"We don't think we need the permission of the UK government to do that,\" she said.\n\nAndrew RT Davies said Labour liked doing things differently \"for the sake of it\"\n\nThe Welsh government consulted jointly with the UK government and Northern Ireland executive on its plans.\n\nWhen the UK government decided not to include glass it cited concerns about creating complexity and burdens for business.\n\nThe UK government said it wanted to deliver a consistent approach for the deposit return scheme across the UK, providing a simple and effective system for both businesses and consumers.\n\n\"We have listened to industry. Businesses have been clear that adding glass to a deposit return scheme will add fundamental complexity for our pubs and restaurants, increase burdens on small businesses, whilst creating greater inconvenience for consumers,\" it said.\n\nWelsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies accused Ms James of being different for the sake of it.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Now they can only afford to fire a few at a time at Russian targets.\n\n\"We haven't got enough ammunition for our weapon,\" he explains.\n\nHis unit, the 17th Tank Battalion, is still being called on to provide fire support to Ukrainian forces desperately clinging on to the edges of Bakhmut, the eastern Ukrainian city which Russia has spent months trying to capture.\n\nRussian forces are getting ever closer to their goal of taking the city, but at enormous cost.\n\nWhile we're waiting in a line of trees, hidden from view, Volodymyr receives a call to fire his rocket launcher at a Russian mortar position about 15 kilometres away.\n\nSome of the Ukrainian Grad missile supplies are coming from the Czech Republic, Romania and Pakistan\n\nHis men remove the branches camouflaging their vehicle. They drive towards an empty field about a kilometre away and quickly work out the range.\n\nThey elevate the rocket barrels towards the target while, out of sight, a Ukrainian drone hovering above assesses their accuracy.\n\nThey're told their first rocket misses by about 50 metres, so they adjust the elevation and fire another two and quickly return to the trees for cover. This time they're told they've hit the target.\n\nVolodymyr however, is frustrated they can't do more. \"We could have provided more support to our guys who are dying there.\"\n\nHe says Ukraine has already burned through its own stocks of Grad ammunition, so is relying on rockets sourced from other countries. Volodymyr says supplies are coming from the Czech Republic, Romania and Pakistan. He complains the rockets originating from Pakistan are \"not of a good quality\".\n\nUkraine's call for more weapons and ammunition has only become louder the longer the war has gone on. The focus now is preparing for a major offensive. But at the same time Ukraine is still having to expend huge resources on just maintaining its position.\n\nDespite the recent arrival of modern weapons - like tanks and armoured vehicles - Ukraine remains heavily reliant on its older, Soviet-era arsenal.\n\nThe Russian-made Buk air defence system, which can target aircraft, drones and missiles, is still one of its prized possessions. We get rare access to see one further along the front line - also hidden in a wooded area.\n\nThis sophisticated weaponry has helped prevent Russia gaining control of the skies.\n\nJosef, the Buk commander, tells me it's \"target number one for Russia\". This explains the extreme care taken to protect it. The long vehicle with its radar dome is buried in a deep trench covered with camouflage netting. On top are two grey missiles. Normally it carries four.\n\nSerhiy fears Ukraine won't have resources for the war to go on for five or ten years\n\nA cache of classified US documents was leaked online earlier this month - maps, charts and photos - revealing detailed intelligence gathered on the war.\n\nI ask Josef if these were correct in highlighting an acute shortage of Buk missiles. \"No, that's not true,\" he insists. But he does admit that the Buk is proving hard to maintain and Ukraine needs more.\n\n\"We haven't got enough,\" he says. \"Parts break and we haven't got spares because the factories that produce them are not in Ukraine.\"\n\nJosef doesn't only dispute some of the contents of those leaked US intelligence reports. He questions whether they have really revealed any secrets.\n\n\"Why should we be angry with the Americans?\" he asks. \"Because they gave information the Russians have had for 20 years? Ridiculous!\" Russia, he believes, has always known about the capabilities of Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nBut Russia still does not know the timing or place of Ukraine's expected offensive. It will be key to taking back territory and relieving some of the pressure being felt along Ukraine's 800 mile (1,300km) front. Wherever it happens Russia will have to redirect some of its forces.\n\nBut Ukraine too is having to arm and equip new units to conduct that offensive. Both sides are struggling to feed the front line.\n\nWe're worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us\n\nAt another location near Bakhmut, Ukrainian troops from its 80th Brigade are already expending hundreds of artillery rounds a day, to try to repel Russia's advances.\n\nThey are already using some of the weapons supplied by the West. Serhiy and his men are operating a British made L119 light artillery gun. But Serhiy says they too are having to ration rounds. He says they're firing on average 30 rounds a day.\n\n\"We've got enough people for the moment\", he says. \"But we need ammunition. Ammunition is the most important.\"\n\nI ask Serhiy if this is the make or break year for Ukraine. \"If we go on the offensive this year and retake our land, then we'll win,\" he replies. \"But, if that doesn't happen, then we don't have the resources for the war to go on for another five to ten years.\"\n\nVolodymyr, the commander of the Grad, is even more blunt. \"The country is exhausted, the economy too,\" he says.\n\nAnd he fears that if Ukraine's action on the battlefield are not decisive this year then Western support may falter. \"We are also worried our Western allies are getting tired of helping us.\"\n\nIvan Ryabov, who subjected female anti-war protestors to brutal interrogations, was among those sanctioned\n\nTwo Moscow police officers identified by the BBC as perpetrators of abuses against female anti-war protesters have been sanctioned by the EU.\n\nThe EU accused Ivan Ryabov and Alexander Fedorinov of arbitrary arrest and torture.\n\nThey were among nine people and three institutions sanctioned over sexual and gender-based violence, to coincide with International Women's Day on Wednesday.\n\nOthers included Taliban ministers and officials from South Sudan and Myanmar.\n\nA BBC Eye investigation detailed how Ivan Ryabov was identified by protesters who had been physically abused by him when they were detained in March 2022.\n\nAlexander Fedorinov was identified by the BBC using facial recognition software.\n\nAnnouncing the sanctions in a statement, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Police Josep Borrell said the EU was moving \"from words to action\" in its commitment to \"eliminate all forms of violence of violence against women\".\n\nHe said the sanctions were \"enhancing efforts to counter sexual and gender-based violence, to ensure that those responsible are fully accountable for their actions, and to combat impunity\".\n\nThe two Moscow police officers were sanctioned for their role in \"arbitrary arrests and detentions as well as torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in the context of the censor", "PPL": 0.5976933836936951, "PPL/lower": 0.7508335809872477, "PPL/zlib": 0.00016153875234964731, "Min-5%": 5.799462610600042, "Min-10%": 4.1857791297576, "Min-20%": 2.6506583361287572, "Min-30%": 1.9030082125325933, "Min-40%": 1.4692907914391793, "Min-50%": 1.1882797681443387, "Min-60%": 0.9943876219018445}, {"text": "s ability to win the war.\n\nHe also warned that Russia was planning a fresh offensive, just as reports began emerging from Ukraine of missile strikes following drone attacks overnight.\n\nOn Thursday, the US designated Russia's Wagner group, which is believed to have thousands of mercenaries in Ukraine, a transnational criminal organisation.\n\nIt also imposed fresh sanctions on the group and their associates to \"further impede [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's ability to arm and equip his war machine\", Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShazia Saddiq and Sue Palmer said the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives\n\n\"I lost absolutely everything.

Some people went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. Some victims have since died.\n\nThere has been a public inquiry, led by Sir Wyn, which has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters, and to establish who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them.\n\nSir Wyn said on Monday that his criticisms over delays in compensation \"remain justified\".\n\nMs Saddiq, 39, along with fellow former sub-postmistress Mrs Palmer told the BBC the scandal had had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives.\n\nMs Saddiq, who used to run three Post Offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, said she had \"lost everything\" as a result of being accused of crimes a decade ago, including her home above one branch.\n\nShe did not end up facing criminal prosecution, but she had to leave the area with her two young children after being assaulted with flour in the street.\n\n\"I had to flee, me and my children overnight. They left their friends behind, they had to change schools,\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, who was found not guilty after a trial, said the allegations had \"ruined my life\".\n\n\"I was made homeless, I now live in a one-bedroom studio flat (because of the financial impact),\" she said.\n\nMrs Palmer, from Essex, had previously told the BBC she received a compensation payment in December, but soon realised it was not what it seemed, with a significant chunk of the money going straight to pay her creditors. She is now seeking proper compensation for the scandal.\n\nThe former postmistresses welcomed the latest report by Sir Wyn, but both called for the compensation process to be sped up.\n\n\"To keep a human being in this fight mode for such a long time, it's torturous. I want to be free from this now,\" Ms Saddiq said.\n\nMrs Palmer added: \"Words are no good now, we need actions. We need the Post Office to have accountability and the government.\"\n\nSub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions\n\nIn the report laid before Parliament, Sir Wyn said there was no \"valid legal reason\" why the government and Post Office \"cannot give effect to the commitments they which they have made\" in providing \"full and fair\" compensation.\n\nThe retired judge said it was his job to make sure ministers and Post Office executives \"made good on those promises\" made to provide compensation to legitimate claimants \"promptly\" and to make sure the amounts paid out was \"recognised to be full and fair\".\n\nSir Wyn has long held concerns about the slow progress of compensation for Post Office staff.\n\nBut the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read, told the BBC's World At One programme that the \"sheer scale\" of the miscarriage of justice had \"gone above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect\".\n\n\"It really is a huge apology from the Post Office. We are all in this together and we are all on the same side,\" he said, but he rejected claims the Post Office was deliberately delaying proceedings.\n\nSir Wyn said it had been 16 months since he first started to hear the experiences of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, which he said \"consisted of graphic descriptions of hardship and suffering\".\n\nThe former High Court judge there were 438 applications for compensation still to be resolved as of 27 April, which he said the Post Office had accepted were \"difficult to resolve\".\n\n\"I am left with the distinct impression that the most complex cases have not been addressed as speedily as might have been the case,\" he said.\n\nAs the Post Office scandal has developed, three different compensation schemes have been set up.\n\nBut Sir Wyn said he was \"sure\" that if the government and Post Office were devising a scheme to deliver compensation to all involved now, there would not be three of them.\n\nHe also warned there was a \"clear and real risk\" that final compensation payments under one scheme - the Group Litigation Order set up by the government last year - \"will not be delivered to each applicant\" by the 7 August 2024 deadline.\n\nHe set out a series of recommendations, one of which was for payments to be made after the deadline, which he described as an \"entirely artificial cut-off point\".\n\nKevin Hollinrake, the Post Office Minister appointed last autumn, said the government would review the report and respond in due course.\n\n\"It is vital that we establish the facts behind this scandal and learn the lessons so that something like this can never happen again,\" he said.\n\nThe new owner of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) US operations, First Citizens, is cutting around 500 roles held by former SVB workers, the BBC understands.\n\nTwo months ago, First Citizens bought the business after SVB's collapse.\n\nThe failure of SVB, along with two other US banks, triggered fears of a more widespread banking crisis, which forced authorities to step in.\n\nSVB's business in the UK was bought in March by London-headquartered banking giant HSBC for a nominal \u00a31 ($1.25).\n\nIn an email seen by the BBC, First Citizens' chief executive Frank Holding highlighted the problems faced by SVB earlier this year and said the cuts will affect: \"select SVB corporate functions and do not include any personnel in client-facing positions.\"\n\n\"The team in India that supports SVB is not impacted by the changes,\" he added.\n\nThe BBC understands that the job cuts amount to around 3% of the company's total workforce.\n\nThe story was first reported by US-based news website Axios.\n\nFirst Citizens is based in Raleigh, in the US state of North Carolina and calls itself America's biggest family-controlled bank. It has been one of the largest buyers of troubled banks in recent years.\n\nUnder the deal, all 17 former SVB branches opened under the First Citizens brand.\n\nIn the UK, HSBC bought SVB's British operations in a deal led by the government and the Bank of England.

Mr Trump had not.\n\n\"The Department [of Justice] and the FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law,\" the report concluded.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said it had \"already implemented dozens of corrective actions\".\n\n\"Had those reforms been in place in 2016, the missteps identified in the report could have been prevented,\" the statement added.\n\nSpecial Counsel John Durham was appointed by then Attorney General William Barr in 2019\n\nThe FBI investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which was carried out by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, led to dozens of criminal charges against Trump campaign staff and associates for crimes including computer hacking and financial crimes.\n\nIt did not, however, find that the Trump campaign and Russia had conspired together to influence the election.\n\nWriting on his social media platform, Truth Social, Mr Trump said the Durham report showed that the \"American public was scammed\". He cited the report's conclusion that there had not been enough evidence to warrant a full investigation by the FBI. Mr Trump has long claimed that members of the \"Deep State\" are targeting him unfairly.\n\nLast year, Mr Trump said he believed the Durham report would provide evidence of \"really bad, evil, unlawful and unconstitutional\" activities and \"reveal corruption at a level never before seen in our country\".\n\nThe Durham report falls short of the blockbuster revelations and prosecutions that some Trump allies hoped for from the inquiry.\n\nThe four-year investigation has resulted in three prosecutions. They include an FBI attorney who pleaded guilty to altering evidence while applying for permission to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign official.\n\nTwo other people were acquitted on charges of lying to the FBI.\n\nThe former president cited some court filings by the Durham team as part of a lawsuit he filed against Mrs Clinton and several other Democrats and government officials, alleging that they had plotted to undermine his 2016 presidential bid by spreading rumours about his campaign's ties to Russia.\n", "PPL": 1.0239626169204712, "PPL/lower": 0.8530622362677486, "PPL/zlib": 0.00027809957004901447, "Min-5%": 7.3897568244560095, "Min-10%": 5.833999902594323, "Min-20%": 4.146820668194871, "Min-30%": 3.1624914807683093, "Min-40%": 2.495745103050269, "Min-50%": 2.031498987005545, "Min-60%": 1.7026819824195598}, {"text": "to send female astronauts to space have been scuppered by the lack of spacesuits in their size.\n\nA well-fitting suit is crucial to prevent excessive fatigue and at worst, physical harm.\n\nIn 2019 Nasa had planned to send an entirely female team of astronauts to complete a space walk from the International Space Station.\n\nBut just days before Anne McClain and Christina Koch were due to depart on the walk, Nasa realised they didn't have two spacesuits in the correct size for both women, and McClain had to be replaced by colleague Nick Hague.\n\nNasa now believes the new design will overcome these problems and meet some of the challenges posed by the Artemis III mission to the moon, due to lift off in 2025.\n\nAstronaut Anne McClain was replaced on an International Space Station walk in 2019 because of an ill-fitting spacesuit\n\nThe key requirement of a spacesuit is to provide oxygen at the right pressure to the astronauts which allow them to survive in the near-vacuum of space.

Some cite the case of Miguel Jones, a Bilbao native born in Equatorial Guinea who trained with the club. Policy at the time, however, dictated players must be born locally, so Jones was let go and instead enjoyed a successful career at Atletico Madrid in the 1960s.\n\nJones himself dismissed claims of racism, citing white players who experienced the same fate, and celebrated Inaki's emergence before his death in 2020.

But Inaki is the best example of hard work.\"\n\nAthletic fans can reluctantly accept when a star player goes as long as they leave money - in the form of a fat transfer fee - on the table. Aymeric Laporte, a \u00a357m departure to Manchester City, for example. Nico's previous contract was due to expire in June 2024, but in December he signed an extension through to 2027, under his brother's guidance.\n\n\"Inaki, of course, was also in on these decisions with his family,\" says Gonzalez. \"They feel very well here in Bilbao.

Total revenue increased by 24% from 2022 to a record-high \u00a3549.6m, with matchday income reaching a record \u00a3117.6m. But they reported a loss for the fourth successive year following the 2022 deficit of \u00a350.1m. Levy stressed the need to \"capitalise on our long-term potential\". \"To continue to invest in the teams and undertake future capital projects, the club requires a significant increase in its equity base,\" he said. \"The board and its advisors, Rothschild & Co, are in discussions with prospective investors. Any recommended investment proposal would require the support of the club's shareholders.\" Under Premier League profit and sustainability (PSR) regulations, clubs can lose a maximum of \u00a3105m over a three-season period, or \u00a335m per campaign, before facing sanctions. Tottenham's losses over the last three years are beyond that threshold at \u00a3220.7m, but the annual depreciation charge of \u00a372m, which refers to their stadium and other facilities, means they are not at risk of breaching PSR regulations. Everton and Nottingham Forest have already been punished with points deductions this campaign for breaking PSR rules, while Championship side Leicester were charged last month by the Premier League for allegedly breaking spending rules during their last three seasons in the top flight. \"The club remains fully compliant with the rules and is supportive of the enhancement of PSR to ensure the Premier League remains competitive and sustainable,\" Levy said. \"We have operated on a financially sustainable basis and can now optimise the true value of key assets, the unrivalled facilities at our multi-use stadium and our training campus. \"We expect commercial revenues to rise from third-party events, although this will not compensate for the lack of European football this season.\" After finishing fourth in 2021-22, Tottenham returned to the Champions League last season - reaching the last 16 - bringing in \u00a356.2m in Uefa prize money, compared to \u00a310.2m in the previous year's accounts when they suffered a group-stage exit from the Europa Conference League. They finished eighth in the Premier League in 2022-23 and are not involved in European football this term. Tottenham's accounts for 2022-23 showed operating expenses had risen by 21% from \u00a3403.4m to \u00a3487.9m, due to increased first-team costs and the hosting of multiple non-football events, such as NFL fixtures, boxing and music concerts. A \"significant and continued investment in the playing squad\" saw the wage bill rise by 20% to \u00a3251m. Levy also had a pay increase from \u00a33.2m to \u00a33.5m, while taking home a \u00a33m bonus. In March, Tottenham announced season ticket prices would increase by 6% for the 2024-25 season, with the most affordable adult season ticket costing \u00a3856, up from \u00a3807 this season. They are also removing the concession for new senior season ticket holders - those aged 65 and above - from 2025-26. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the decision was \"unacceptable\" and \"cannot be justified\". Tottenham said the increase in season ticket prices is because they have only raised prices once in the past five years - by 1.5% - and there had been a \"significant increase in matchday costs\". The accounts do not mention how much it cost to dismiss manager Antonio Conte, who was relieved of his duties at the club in March 2023, with Ange Postecoglou appointed his permanent successor on 6 June after interim spells from Cristian Stellini and Ryan Mason. Spurs also saw talisman Harry Kane sold to Bayern Munich for 100m euros (\u00a386.4m) in August, but that deal fell outside of the financial window and will be included in the 2023-24 accounts. Likewise, the outlay for new additions Micky van de Ven and Brennan Johnson will feature in next year's accounts.\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Spurs - go straight to all the best content\n\nTwitter has experienced major problems with posting some images and links - the second time in a week it has suffered technical issues.\n\nClicking on links in posts resulted in users receiving an error message.\n\nTwitter said some parts of the service were not \"working as expected\" and blamed an internal change that \"had some unintended consequences\".\n\nIt later said \"things should now be working as normal.

They will no longer be able to receive referral fees paid by debt solution companies.\n\nFor some people, there is little or no chance of paying off debts, and so they may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\n\nAn individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) - is an agreement with creditors to pay debt.\n\nThe individual agrees to make regular affordable payments to an insolvency practitioner, who will divide this money between creditors. At the end of an IVA any unsecured debt left is written off.\n\nDebt Relief Orders (DRO) freeze debt repayments and interest for 12 months if the money owed is less than \u00a330,000 and the individual does not own a property. In that time, creditors cannot recover their money without the court's permission. At the end of the 12 months the debt is written off.\n\nA typical IVA can cost anything up to \u00a33,600 over a customer's lifetime while DROs can be less than \u00a3100.\n\nThe regulator said this business model \"incentivises bad advice\" and meant that companies recommend options that make them more money, rather than what is in the customer's best interest.\n\nThe FCA said it had seen evidence of debt packagers appearing to manipulate customers' details so that they meet the criteria for IVAs and using persuasive language to promote products without explaining the risks involved.\n\nIn some of the worst cases identified, the FCA found evidence of customers in financial hardship who were recommended solutions which caused more problems.\n\nOne customer was recommended an IVA by a debt packager when a different solution would have been more suitable. This cost them an extra \u00a34,710 compared with a DRO and meant it would take five years longer to become debt free, the FCA said.\n\nMatthew Upton, acting executive director of advocacy and policy at Citizens Advice said: \"Inaccurate or misleading advice from providers promoting Individual Voluntary Agreements can push people further into hardship and further away from a lasting solution to their problems.\"\n\nHe called on the government to bring all pre-IVA advice under the regulation of the FCA, \"so that people can be sure it's the right solution for them\".\n\nSheldon Mills, executive director of consumers and competition at the FCA, said: \"Good quality debt advice is vital in helping people out of financial difficulty and poor advice can have a devastating impact on those who are already struggling.\"\n\nExisting debt packager firms will need to develop a new way of doing business by October this year or face regulatory action, the regulator said.\n\nThe ban comes into effect immediately for new entrants to the debt packager market.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThere have been violent scenes as Israeli police raided the al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, saying \"agitators\" had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside.\n\nPalestinians said stun grenades and rubber bullets were used in the pre-dawn raid and that 50 people were hurt.\n\nPolice said stones were thrown and fireworks fired at them in the mosque.\n\nMilitants in the Gaza Strip later fired rockets at Israel and its military carried out air strikes in response.\n\nThe latest violence comes just ahead of an overlap between the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday.\n\nThe al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, is located on a hilltop complex known by Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.\n\nOn Tuesday, Palestinians barricaded themselves in the mosque after the evening Ramadan prayer, amid reports that Jewish extremists wanted to try to sacrifice a goat at the site for Passover - as Jews did in Biblical times before the Romans destroyed their temple there. Israeli police and religious authorities have said they would not allow such an act to take place.\n\nIsraeli police said in a statement that \"several law-breaking youths and masked agitators\" fortified the mosque \"in order to disrupt public order and desecrate the mosque\".\n\n\"After many and prolonged attempts to get them out by talking to no avail, police forces were forced to enter the compound in order to get them out with the intentions to allow the Fajr [dawn] prayer and to prevent a violent disturbance,\" it added.\n\n\"When the police entered, stones were thrown at them and fireworks were fired from inside the mosque by a large group of agitators.\"\n\nOne officer was injured in the leg by a stone during the clashes, it said.\n\nVideo released by the police showed fireworks exploding and lighting up the prayer hall as heavily armed officers in riot gear moved in.\n\nOther footage posted on social media appeared to show an officer using a rifle butt and others using sticks to beat Palestinians on the floor amid shouts and screams.\n\nPictures of the aftermath showed overturned furniture and prayer mats scattered across the carpet.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency warned Israel that its actions could have \"dire consequences\"\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent reported that 50 Palestinians were injured. It also said Israeli forces prevented its medics from reaching the mosque, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nSome of the Palestinians still in Israeli custody are in a critical condition, according to their lawyer.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that the police \"had to act to restore order\".\n\n\"Israel is committed to maintaining freedom of worship, free access to all religions and the status quo on the Temple Mount, and will not allow violent extremists to change this,\" he said.\n\nBut the Islamic Waqf, which administers the site, described the police's actions as a \"a flagrant violation of the identity and function of the mosque as a place of worship for Muslims alone\".\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman also condemned the raid, describing it as an attack on Muslim worshippers.\n\n\"We warn the Occupation [Israel] not to cross the red lines in the holy places, which will lead to the big explosion,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said.\n\nThe leader of the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls", "PPL": 0.2556302547454834, "PPL/lower": 0.49979565402075626, "PPL/zlib": 6.990162831432415e-05, "Min-5%": 3.6135613614437627, "Min-10%": 2.199895908289096, "Min-20%": 1.2127647853495147, "Min-30%": 0.8331901416704302, "Min-40%": 0.6332633301356446, "Min-50%": 0.5095346965999852, "Min-60%": 0.4258436915098389}, {"text": "consumers\".\n\n\"The CAA has chosen to cut airport charges to their lowest real terms level in a decade at a time when airlines are making massive profits and Heathrow remains loss-making because of fewer passengers and higher financing costs,\" Heathrow said.\n\nThe airport said the regulator should be \"incentivising investment\" to rebuild aviation services following the heavy blows dealt to the industry during Covid.\n\nBut the CAA said its decision to introduce lower charges from 2024 recognised that passenger numbers were expected to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIt said as well as benefitting travellers in terms of lower costs, the charges would also allow the airport to continue investing in its operations, including planned upgrades to its security scanners and a new baggage system in Terminal 2.\n\n\"Our priority in making this decision today is to ensure the travelling public can expect great value for money from using Heathrow in terms of having a consistently good quality of service, whilst paying no more than is needed for it,\" said Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA.\n\nIn 2021, Heathrow was given permission to raise the passenger charge for airlines from \u00a319.60 to \u00a330.19 for the summer of 2022. The aim was to help it get through the pandemic.\n\nBut British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, two of Heathrow's largest airlines, have long complained that fees at the airport, the busiest airport in western Europe, are the highest in the world.\n\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the the regulator had \"not gone far enough\" in lowering passenger charges or ensuring that a \"monopolistic Heathrow\" was fulfilling its statutory duty to protect consumers.\n\n\"Heathrow has abused its power throughout this process, peddling false narratives and flawed passenger forecasts in an attempt to win an economic argument,\" he added.\n\nLuis Gallego, chief executive of IAG, the parent company of British Airways, said \"high charges\" were \"designed to reward shareholders at the expense of customers\" and risked undermining the competitiveness of Heathrow.\n\nWillie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, said the regulator was \"hostage to Heathrow's pessimistic passenger outlook\", and added the decision still meant airlines and passengers would \"continue to pay one of the highest airport charges in the world\".\n\n\"Given that Heathrow have succeeded in securing this generous settlement, we'll be watching their performance this summer and beyond very closely. Any repeat of the failures we have seen over the past few years would be totally unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nLuggage piled up on some days last summer at Heathrow\n\nLast summer, many airports across the UK struggled to cope with demand for international travel returning, with flights delayed and cancelled due to staff shortages. Many workers in the travel industry lost their jobs at the start the of the pandemic.\n\nMr Moriarty said the CAA had \"considered the sharply differing views\" from Heathrow and the airlines about the level of fees.\n\n\"Understandably, their respective shareholder interests led the airport to argue for higher charges and the airlines to argue for lower charges,\" he added.\n\nBoth airlines and the airport have six weeks to appeal the decision.\n\nManager Carlo Ancelotti said Real Madrid are \"lucky\" to have the \"fantastic\" Jude Bellingham after the England midfielder impressed on debut in a 3-2 pre-season win against AC Milan in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was another Englishman, Fikayo Tomori, who got his name on the scoresheet, heading the opener for AC Milan, but two second-half goals from Federico Valverde and a superb winner from Vinicius Jr, who ran on to a sublime Luka Modric pass, sent the majority of fans in a 70,000 crowd at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena home happy.\n\nBellingham's 62-minute debut had flashes of his natural technique and confidence, twice bringing roars of approval from the crowd and then praise from his manager Ancelotti.\n\nIn the opening stages Bellingham went on a mazy run by the touchline, leaving a couple of Milan defenders in his wake.\n\nThen, as the opening period drew to a close, a brilliant first-time half-volleyed pass, blending dexterity and a sure touch in a crowded penalty area, almost put Brahim Diaz in on goal.\n\n\"It is rare to find player with this kind of quality,\" Ancelotti said. \"He is only 20, so he can improve. We are lucky to have him in our squad.\n\n\"He was fantastic. He has a lot of rhythm, moves well and has quality finding open spaces.\"\n\nReal paid Borussia Dortmund \u00a388m to sign Bellingham on a six-year contract. They can already be assured the 20-year-old is the real deal.\n\nBellingham eases his way into life at Real\n\nAt his public unveiling as a Real player last month, Bellingham said he liked the idea of being out of his \"comfort zone\".\n\nThere is no club in the world where the glare is quite as intense for quite as long.\n\nBut everything about Bellingham - from his solid family background and parental guidance, to the bravery of his move to Dortmund from Birmingham aged only 17, to his decision not to join any of the Premier League suitors this summer in favour of a switch to the Bernabeu - suggests that if anyone can deal with what lies ahead, it is Bellingham.\n\n\"Real Madrid is a big team with big pressure, but from what he did at Borussia Dortmund, he is ready to accept that,\" said football writer Joel Del Rio, who was covering the AC Milan game for Madrid-based newspaper Marca.\n\n\"He is a player who can do everything.\"\n\nWatching Bellingham in the build-up to the game and then the opening hour, before he was replaced with a congratulatory handshake from Ancelotti, was instructive.\n\nFirst of all, Ancelotti picked him at the tip of a diamond, which is the role he has earmarked for the Midlander.\n\nIt allowed Bellingham to ghost and glide into positions of space as Toni Kross, deployed in the sitting position at the base of that midfield, could dictate play.\n\nDespite his tender years and the elite trophy-winning environment he has joined, Bellingham is not scared to demand the ball. When he gets it, he rarely takes the easy option.\n\nAncelotti said: \"He is distinct from our other midfielders and he is going to help us a lot.\n\n\"He could play left or right to use his characteristics, but his best position is as a number 10, where he has more possibility to get near to the opposition goal.\"\n\nBellingham already seems to have a connection with former Manchester City forward Diaz.\n\nThe pair did the pre-match passing drill together and twice Bellingham almost set the 23-year-old up, first with a flicked pass with the outside of his right foot, which drew appeals for a penalty as Tomori slid in to block, then that beautifully delicate half-volley pass very few players can execute.\n\nTomori, 25, was in conversation with Bellingham after the game and told BBC Sport: \"He is so elegant and will be a really good player for them. He said he has gelled in well and a few of the guys speak English, which makes it easier for him.\n\n\"It is good to see so many English players move to different countries. I know the Premier League is big, but there is football beyond that.\"\n\nJudging by the names of the back of the Madrid shirts being worn at the Rose Bowl, Bellingham is not yet vying with Vinicius in terms of popularity.\n\nBut there were still plenty of number five shirts - most famously worn by Zinedine Zidane, now with Bellingham on the back - in the crowd.\n\nBellingham was showing signs of tiredness when his outing was brought to an end and, with matches against Barcelona and Juventus to come before Real return to Madrid, it will be interesting to see how much involvement he has against Manchester United - who were so keen to sign him before he went to Dortmund - in Houston on Wednesday.\n\nA weight loss jab that has gained popularity in the US has been approved for use by the NHS in England.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded semaglutide, marketed as Weg", "PPL": 1.4771051406860352, "PPL/lower": 0.9044949930645575, "PPL/zlib": 0.00039473680937627875, "Min-5%": 7.880035844503665, "Min-10%": 6.638014279159845, "Min-20%": 5.047774360348951, "Min-30%": 4.048203324067864, "Min-40%": 3.358279425313828, "Min-50%": 2.8349880989812104, "Min-60%": 2.426179603373189}, {"text": ", most of whom are crossing Mexico in the hope of reaching the United States.\n\nMany of them have been camped out in cities on the US-Mexico border for weeks and sometimes months, awaiting the possible lifting of a Trump-era policy which allows US border officials to deny individuals entry to the US \"to prevent the spread of communicable diseases\".\n\nThe Biden Administration had moved to end the policy, which is known as Title 42, last year, but the US Supreme Court blocked the move at the end of December and it remains in place.\n\nHowever, many migrants from Central and South America, as well as from as far afield as Africa, continue to embark on long treks to the US-Mexico border in the hope of the restrictions being lifted.\n\nLast updated on .From the section European Football\n\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag hailed goalscoring skipper Bruno Fernandes as the star man in his side's Europa League last-16 first-leg victory against Real Betis.\n\nFernandes had taken the brunt of huge criticism heaped on United following Sunday's record 7-0 Premier League humiliation at Liverpool.\n\nBut Ten Hag confirmed in the build-up the Portuguese would remain captain if Harry Maguire was not on the field - and Fernandes repaid that faith with an outstanding contribution to a much-needed win.\n\nIt included his eighth goal of the season as he headed home Luke Shaw's 58th-minute corner.\n\n\"He was the best player on the pitch,\" said Ten Hag. \"He played a little deeper role and he was brilliant, making the game from the back position, with a lot of good passes in between the lines. From there we created a lot of chances.\"\n\u2022 None Reaction from Old Trafford and Thursday's European action\n\nTen Hag accepted Fernandes was not perfect. A late tackle on Betis' former Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo brought the midfielder a yellow card and did not look good.\n\nBut the United boss admitted it is a fine line Fernandes has to tread.\n\n\"His passion is his strength,\" added Ten Hag. \"But sometimes he has to control that because when it's too much, it becomes a weakness. He knows that, but there are always small margins.\"\n\nFernandes ran away to celebrate his goal with his hands to his ears as the home fans chanted 'Bruno, Bruno' in his honour, showing they are behind him as well.\n\nMarcus Rashford, Antony and Wout Weghorst were also on the scoresheet as United put themselves in a strong position to reach the last eight when the tie is concluded in Seville next week.\n\nBut Ten Hag knows one win alone will not banish the memory of Sunday's annihilation at Anfield, especially as he had been irritated by some of his side's performances preceding it, including the Carabao Cup final victory against Newcastle.\n\n\"We don't ignore it,\" he said. \"We made mistakes and we got hammered. We showed complacency and you can never do that in top football.\n\n\"In the weeks before, I was not happy against Newcastle and the performance against Leicester in the first half, but sometimes you have to get the bad result where everyone opens their eyes.\"\n\nIn his programme notes, Ten Hag described the Anfield debacle as 'unacceptable' and said he had left his players in no doubt such performances would not be tolerated.\n\nAnd, in a move that smacked of the Dutchman applying collective responsibility for the loss rather than singling out individuals for blame, he named an unchanged line-up.\n\nFor half an hour, all went well.\n\nThe hosts dominated as Rashford drove home his 26th goal of a magnificent season in the sixth minute after Fernandes' cross had been diverted into his path.\n\nFurther chances were created - the issue was none of them went in.\n\nBravo twice denied Rashford, Fernandes had a shot blocked and Weghorst's near-post effort was deflected wide even though he didn't get a corner.\n\nBetis' form in La Liga, where they are fifth, suggested they were not as poor as it appeared and Ayoze Perez proved it when he drilled home a low shot from the angle of the penalty area.\n\nHad the on-loan Leicester City forward got a second after he was set up by Juanmi - gifted possession by David de Gea, who rolled a pass straight to him from inside his six-yard box - anxiety might have spread through home ranks.\n\nAs it was, Perez's deflected shot bounced back off a post and United survived - although question marks remain over keeper De Gea, whose contract expires in the summer.\n\nEven Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini, who barely said anything noteworthy to the media during his three years as Manchester City boss, couldn't resist a pre-match dig at United after their seven-goal defeat at Liverpool.\n\nAs the weeks pass, it will be interesting to see if any individual does pay a price for what unfolded in what many view as the Premier League's greatest rivalry.\n\nFor now though, it can be claimed normal service has resumed.\n\nAntony's superb curling shot restored the home side's advantage seven minutes after the restart and Weghorst found the net with a first-time strike eight minutes from time.\n\nThe key element of that late effort though was the contribution of Facundo Pellistri.\n\nGood enough to play all three games for Uruguay in Qatar at the World Cup, the 21-year-old was only making his fifth United appearance, all off the bench.\n\nBut Pellistri's role in Weghorst's second United goal suggests he will be called upon more often as the campaign reaches its crucial phase.\n\nIgnoring the safety-first option of a pass back to halfway, he took off on a run past the Betis defence to the byeline where he sent a cross back to Scott McTominay, whose effort was blocked and bounced kindly for Weghorst to finish.\n\u2022 None Offside, Manchester United.

That could include age verification.\n\nLucy Crompton-Reid, chief executive of Wikimedia UK, an independent charity affiliated with the foundation, warns some material on the site could trigger age verification.\n\n\"For example, educational text and images about sexuality could be misinterpreted as pornography,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms MacKinnon wrote: \"The Wikimedia Foundation will not be verifying the age of UK readers or contributors.\"\n\nAs well as requiring Wikipedia to gather data about its users, checking ages would also require a \"drastic overhaul\" to technical systems.\n\nIf a service does not comply with the bill, there can be serious consequences potentially including large fines, criminal sanctions for senior staff, or restricting access to a service in the UK.\n\nWikimedia UK fears that site could be blocked because of the Bill, and the risk that it will mandate age checks.\n\nIt was \"definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world - and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people - won't be accessible to UK readers (let alone UK-based contributors)\", wrote Ms Crompton-Reid.\n\nThere are currently 6.6 million articles on Wikipedia, and she said it was \"impossible to imagine\" how it would cope with checking content to comply with the bill.\n\nShe added: \"Worldwide there are two edits per second across Wikipedia's 300-plus languages.\"\n\nThe foundation has previously said the bill would fundamentally change the way the site operated by forcing it to moderate articles rather than volunteers.\n\nIt wants the law to follow the EU Digital Services Act, which differentiates between centralised content moderation carried out by employees and the Wikipedia-style model by community volunteers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Lords debated an amendment from Conservative peer Lord Moylan that would exempt services \"provided for the public benefit\", such as encyclopaedias, from the bill.\n\nHeritage Minister Lord Parkinson said he did not think this would be feasible, but added that Wikipedia was an example of how community moderation can be effective.\n\nHe said the bill did not say that every service needed to have age checks, and it was expected that \"only services which pose the highest risk to children will use age verification technologies\".\n\nMs Crompton-Reid told the BBC that while Lord Parkinson's remarks \"reassured\" her , the charity did not want to be relying on future goodwill and interpretation of legislation.\n\nIt would continue to urge that protections to community moderation were in the bill through measures such as an exception for public benefit websites like Wikipedia, she said.\n\nA government spokesperson told the BBC the bill had been \"designed to strike the balance between tackling harm without imposing unnecessary burdens on low-risk tech companies\".\n\nCommunications watchdog Ofcom will enforce it and would \"focus on services where the risk of harm is highest\".\n\nThe government also believes it is unlikely Wikipedia would be classed as a category one service, those that would be subject to the bill's strictest rules.\n\nSouth Koreans will turn a year or two younger under a new law\n\nSouth Koreans have become a year or two younger as a new law aligns the nation's two traditional age-counting methods with international standards.\n\nThe law scraps one traditional system that deemed South Koreans one year old at birth, counting time in the womb.\n\nAnother counted everyone as ageing by a year every first day of January instead of on their birthdays.\n\nThe switch to age-counting based on birth date took effect on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol pushed strongly for the change when he ran for office last year. The traditional age-counting methods created \"unnecessary social and economic costs\", he said.\n\nFor instance, disputes have arisen over insurance pay-outs and determining eligibility for government assistance programmes.\n\nPreviously, the most widely used calculation method in Korea was the centuries-old \"Korean age\" system, in which a person turns one at birth and gains a year on 1 January. This means a baby born on 31 December will be two years old the next day.\n\nA separate \"counting age\" system, that was also traditionally used in the country, considers a person zero at birth and adds a year on 1 January.\n\nThis means that, for example, as of 28 June 2023, a person born on 29 June 2003 is 19 under the international system, 20 under the \"counting age\" system and 21 under the \"Korean age\"", "PPL": 1.1303410530090332, "PPL/lower": 0.8471683037501585, "PPL/zlib": 0.0003023919349943909, "Min-5%": 7.026864603453991, "Min-10%": 5.621776141372382, "Min-20%": 4.135882861748302, "Min-30%": 3.2624007498402547, "Min-40%": 2.6643571495864093, "Min-50%": 2.2149005131113215, "Min-60%": 1.8733586333024677}, {"text": "before the end, and right now we are no closer to knowing who will end up on top.\n\nAt the moment it is Liverpool who have the advantage, but only after a real battle to fight back and beat Brighton.\n\nIt was not a great team performance by Jurgen Klopp's side, but we've seen all season that it doesn't have to be when you have the firepower they do.\n\nLiverpool are relentless when they come forward, especially at Anfield, and they kept on creating chances - Alexis Mac Allister was magnificent in midfield.\n\nMohamed Salah had one of those days where he was shooting at every opportunity, but when myself, Gary Lineker and Glenn Murray were watching for MOTD2, all three of us as former strikers thought it was only a matter of time before one of them went in.\n\nThe sign of a great goalscorer is that you are never bothered when you are missing chances because you still believe you are going to get a goal.\n\nThat was the case with Salah.

Lawyers are responsible. It's time to take a stand.\"\n\nIn a statement, Mr Vineall said: \"The cab rank rule prevents barristers from refusing work because they disagree with the actions or views of those seeking their services.\"\n\nThe rule \"promotes access to justice and promotes the rule of law\", he said, adding: \"It is disappointing that some lawyers apparently wish to remove these rights from people of whom they disapprove.\"\n\n\"I would be profoundly unhappy if a climate change activist accused of a public order offence were ever to be precluded from obtaining the services of the barrister of their choice because their chosen barrister happened to disapprove of the particular way in which they had been protesting,\" he said.\n\nPlan B said the declaration would be launched on 29 March outside the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nMP and former solicitor general Robert Buckland said it was a \"very odd approach\" and \"not really consistent with the role of a lawyer.\"\n\n\"When lawyers start picking and choosing, in a way it undermines the independence of the legal profession\", he told the Daily Mail.\n\nHe added: \"There are plenty of people lawyers represent who are deeply unpleasant and deeply unpopular, such as rapists and paedophiles.\n\n\"But they are entitled to a fair trial.\"\n\nFormer Conservative minister Nadine Dorries has announced she is standing down as an MP.\n\nThe former culture secretary and close ally of Boris Johnson said she was standing down \"with immediate effect\" after \"something significant\" happened to change her mind.\n\nIt means there will be a by-election in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency, where she has a majority of 24,664.\n\nMs Dorries had already said she would not stand at the next general election.\n\nIt came ahead of the publication of Mr Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nMs Dorries had been expected to be nominated for an honour, but she was not included on the list.\n\nEarlier on Friday, she told TalkTV: \"The last thing I would want to do is cause a by-election in my constituency.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I will be going into the House of Lords any time soon,\" she said, adding that she had not been contacted by anybody in No 10 about the honours list.\n\nHowever, after announcing she was standing down, she told the channel: \"The House of Lords thing was on the cards and it's gone back to HOLAC [the House of Lords Appointments Commission] to be vetted.\"\n\nThe advisory body is responsible for vetting nominations for peerages.\n\nAsked if she thought she should be in the House of Lords, Ms Dorries said it was \"very rare\" for someone from her background who was born into poverty to get a peerage.\n\nShe added that she was \"slightly disappointed\" but \"I don't think it was to be\".\n\nMs Dorries said \"something significant did happen to change my mind\" about remaining an MP, but she would not give further details.\n\nShe said she now had \"other priorities\", including her granddaughter and media career as a presenter on TalkTV and columnist for the Daily Mail.\n\nThe former culture secretary said she felt \"relief\", adding: \"I think I've been carrying a degree of guilt since I stood down as secretary of state.

These contribute to global warming.\n\nEmissions per kilometre travelled are known to be significantly worse than any other form of transport, with short-haul flights the worst emitters, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\u2022 None Should clubs stop flying to domestic matches for environmental reasons?\n\u2022 None Find out more about sport and climate change\n\nWhat about these 'positioning' flights?\n\n'Positioning' flights are where the plane is getting into position to pick up its private charter passengers. They are normally what the aviation industry calls \"empty leg\" flights - so without passengers and therefore qualify as 'ghost' flights, a term increasingly being used to describe any flight with fewer than 10% passengers.\n\nBBC Sport contacted the airlines involved but received no confirmation as to the number of passengers on these flights.\n\nAs the Premier League's most southerly team, Bournemouth perhaps have more justification than others to fly to some games. They flew to Birmingham airport and back on the weekend of 17-18 March for their fixture with Aston Villa - a return journey totalling 73 minutes.\n\nBut the data pointed towards a further four 'positioning flights' connected to this trip - three of which were to or from Scotland - totalling an additional 201 minutes.\n\nIn addition to the 37 marked positioning flights, the BBC Sport research also observed instances of planes flying from one London airport to another in advance of a player flight - although not marked as 'positioning' flights. It is therefore possible the actual number could be higher.\n\u2022 None Green Football Weekend: What are clubs, players and fans doing?\n\nThe Premier League does not centrally mandate clubs' individual travel plans, but said in a statement to BBC Sport that it \"recognises the need to take action on climate change and is committed to reducing its overall climate impact\".\n\nThe statement added: \"Clubs have demonstrated their commitment to positive change in this area and continue to play an important role in raising awareness of the issue among fans, while also working on policies to improve environmental sustainability across their business operations.\"\n\nThose policies, the Premier League pointed out, include more sustainable fan travel initiatives, use of renewable energy and conservation projects.\n\nThe scale of the emissions\n\nThe Premier League pointed out that in the two-month period of the BBC Sport research, there were more than 74,000 domestic flights in the UK - putting the 81 Premier League club flights at less than 0.1% of that total.\n\nArsenal told BBC Sport that domestic flights of this type \"accounted for 0.25% of the club's total emissions for season 2021-22\".\n\nAn Arsenal spokesperson said: \"Domestic flights are sometimes a necessity based on player welfare and operational needs. The need to fly often depends on kick-off time, the time in between our matches and the reliability of alternative transport methods.\"\n\nThe biggest emissions are generated from stadiums on matchdays and fan travel - which is the sport's biggest climate footprint. The Premier League statement said its work will also include \"encouraging fans\" to \"consider how\" they can reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, Dale Vince, chairman of League One side Forest Green, regarded as the world's most sustainable football team, called it \"shocking data in just two months\", adding: \"It's an illusion to think there is a gain for a flight of that duration, modern coaches are very comfortable and aren't going to impair the performance of the players over that short distance\"\n\nVince believes the Premier League and its clubs should lead the way.\n\nVince said: \"The carbon impact is one thing\u2026 I think the bigger impact is the emotional one, the intellectual one, you've got Premier League teams setting a very bad example for the rest of the country... when we are desperately in need of getting to net zero.\n\n\"This comes just days after the latest UN report that says we absolutely have just a few years left to act to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.\"\n\nThe Premier League has signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework and as a result is tasked with reaching net zero by 2040. That was in November 2021 but it is yet to confirm its plans.\n\nThe statement added: \"The Premier League is in the process of developing an environmental sustainability strategy, which will set out plans to deliver climate action. As part of this strategy, the league will continue to engage with and work alongside clubs and partners, to find practical ways of reducing football's environmental impact.\"\n\nWhat are the factors?\n\nPremier League clubs have been travelling this way for years - generally the quickest and most convenient option which clubs argue gives players and staff maximum time to prepare and recover between games, when the global fixture schedule is increasingly packed - something the clubs have no control over.\n\nIt is only recently, as players started to frequently post images on social media of these short domestic flights, that it attracted increased scrutiny in an era of climate impact awareness.\n\nAs this season shows, competition in the Premier League is as fierce as ever - just four points separates the bottom nine teams as they scramble to stay in the division and reap the multi-million pound rewards.\n\nWith such fine margins and enormous financial consequences, will clubs really risk a potential disadvantage by opting for slower but more environmentally friendly travel to high-stakes fixtures?\n\nMatt Konipinski is director of physio and performance at Rehab 4 Performance and has worked with Liverpool, Rangers and Barnsley football clubs. He disputes the performance argument, but does acknowledge that in a busy schedule time might be the overriding concern.\n\nHe said: \"I think physical condition is a consideration but I think the mode of travel doesn't necessarily have a huge amount of scientific support to justify one versus the other.\n\n\"We're talking about the options around whether a team might fly, whether a team may take the coach, whether a team may take the train and really the main emphasis around flying is speed and the top teams will prioritise speed over everything else.\"\n\nThere is no previous flight information to compare season with season. However, clubs have told BBC Sport that this season the cost of chartering planes has almost doubled as a result of both the rise in the price of fuel and decreased availability of planes after the pandemic and Brexit.\n\nWith pressure to spend money to attract better players, plus the increased focus on sustainability in the game, many clubs said the plane is the last resort - and that this 2022-23 season might actually see a reduction in flights from previous years. And that is despite running issues with England's rail network.\n\nChelsea manager Graham Potter gave an honest appraisal of the challenges facing football, saying: \"I think it's something we increasingly have to look at, because I think it's something we have to do better with. It's my personal opinion. That's not to say its straightforward because there are factors, but I think it's an area we can improve.\"\n\nNottingham Forest were one of the few clubs who shared their full flight data with BBC Sport", "PPL": 1.7817721366882324, "PPL/lower": 0.9512215518238794, "PPL/zlib": 0.00046400316059589384, "Min-5%": 8.74884895249909, "Min-10%": 7.260049221562404, "Min-20%": 5.665354733362174, "Min-30%": 4.6697262937160575, "Min-40%": 3.94598791174254, "Min-50%": 3.3755097645916976, "Min-60%": 2.9141085041559482}, {"text": "the fight for values and freedom, the commitment to peace and unity,\" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the award ceremony.\n\nIn other developments on Sunday:\n\nPresident Zelensky flew to Germany from Italy overnight, his plane escorted by two German Air Force fighter jets.\n\nIn Rome, the Ukrainian leader met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

Falls in the value of bonds held by banks are not necessarily a problem unless they are forced to sell them.\n\nAuthorities around the world have said they do not think the failures threaten widespread financial stability and need to distract from efforts to bring inflation under control.\n\nLast week, the European Central Bank raised its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe Bank of England is due to make its own interest rate decision on Thursday, a day after official figures showed that inflation unexpectedly shot up in February to 10.4%.\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed remained focused on its inflation fight. He described Silicon Valley bank as an \"outlier\" in an otherwise strong financial system.\n\nBut he acknowledged that the recent turmoil was likely to drag on growth, with the full impact still unclear.\n\nForecasts released by the bank show officials expect the economy to grow just 0.4% this year and 1.2% in 2024, a sharp slowdown from the norm - and less than officials projected in December.\n\nThe announcement from the Fed also toned down earlier statements which had said \"ongoing\" increases in interest rates would be needed in the months ahead.\n\nInstead, the Fed said: \"Some additional policy firming may be appropriate\".\n\nThe moves \"signal clearly that the Fed is nervous\", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nWednesday's rate rise is the ninth in a row by the Fed. It lifts its key interest rate to 4.75%-5%, up from near zero a year ago - the highest level since 2007.\n\nHigher interest rates mean the cost to buy a home, borrow to expand a business or take on other debt goes up.\n\nBy making such activity more expensive, the Fed expects demand to fall, cooling prices.\n\nThat has started to happen in the US housing market, where purchases have slowed sharply over the last year and the median sales price in February was lower than it was a year ago - the first such decline in more than a decade.\n\nBut overall the economy has held up better than expected and prices continue to climb faster than the 2% rate considered healthy.\n\nInflation, the rate at which prices climb, jumped 6% in the 12 months to February. The cost of some items, including food and airfare, is surging even faster.\n\nBefore the bank failures, Mr Powell had warned that officials might need to push interest rates higher than expected to bring the situation under control.\n\nThe bank projections show policymakers expect inflation to fall this year - but less than expected a few months ago.\n\nStill, they forecast interest rates of roughly 5.1% at the end of 2023 - unchanged since December - implying the Fed is poised to stop raising rates soon.\n\nMr Powell described the effect of the recent turmoil as the \"equivalent of a rate hike\".\n\nHe said the Fed may be able raise its key rate less aggressively, if the turmoil in the financial system prompts banks to limit lending, and the economy to slow more quickly.\n\nBut he repeated that the Fed would not shy away from its inflation fight.\n\n\"We have to bring down inflation down to 2%,\" he said. \"There are real costs to bringing it down to 2% but the costs of failing are much higher.\"\n\nParents rushed to a school in Tehran to pick up their children, as ambulances waited outside\n\nDozens of girls from 26 schools in Iran are reportedly being treated for poisoning at hospitals after another wave of apparent toxic gas attacks.\n\nMore than 1,000 students have been affected since November. They have suffered respiratory problems, nausea, dizziness and fatigue.\n\nMany Iranians suspect the poisonings are a deliberate attempt to force girls' schools to close.\n\nBut the government has not said whether it believes they are premeditated.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, who has been tasked by the president with finding the \"root cause\" of the poisonings, on Wednesday dismissed as \"false\" a report by Fars news agency that three people had been arrested.\n\nHe also accused foreign-based media and \"mercenary groups\" of taking advantage of the situation to wage psychological war and worry people.\n\nSome pupils and parents suggested that schoolgirls may have been targeted for taking part in recent anti-government protests.\n\nAt least 26 schools in five cities across Iran were affected by the latest gas poisonings, local media and activists said.\n\nBBC Persian verified videos showing ambulances arriving at schools and students being treated in hospitals in the capital Tehran, the north-western city of Ardabil and the western city of Kermanshah.\n\nIn one from Tehransar, in western Tehran, several girls purportedly from 13 Aban School are seen lying on beds in a hospital ward and receiving oxygen.\n\nAnother video from the city's east shows girls sitting on the pavement outside a primary school.

The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology.\n\nThe submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.\n\nUnder the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more.\n\nAfter that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS.\n\nThis attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries.\n\nThe US, Australia and UK will jointly build a new class of submarines\n\nPresident Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open.\n\n\"Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,\" he said.\n\nHe also pledged of $4.6bn (\u00a33.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines.\n\nAustralia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (\u00a3201bn) over 30 years - marked the \"biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history\".\n\nAnthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs.

The UK government said the Universal Support scheme will fund up to 50,000 work placements each year.\n\nMegan Thomas of Disability Wales says the work capability assessment was \"not fit for purpose\"\n\nMegan Thomas from Disability Wales said scrapping the WCA was a \"positive step\" but argued the changes should go further.\n\n\"One of the things we see is a lot of barriers not just to accessing work but higher paid work,\" she said.\n\n\"That barrier is there often because of a myriad of reasons, whether it's access to education or accessing the workplace itself.\"\n\nBen Francis from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said he would like to see greater support for disabled people to become self-employed.\n\n\"We would have preferred to have seen the government and employers coming together to form some sort of 'kick-start' scheme which would ultimately encourage disabled people into the workplace and one of those strands would be advocating self-employment as a viable route,\" Mr Francis said.\n\n\"An FSB report has found 25% of small business owners either have a disability or some form of illness, therefore a lot can be learned from them about the benefits of self-employment.\"\n\nMark Francois said the European Research Group (ERG) has not decided whether the vote against the Brexit deal\n\nA group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs has branded a significant part of the prime minister's new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland \"practically useless\".\n\nBut the MPs have not decided whether to reject the deal in a key vote on Wednesday.\n\nThe European Research Group (ERG) has published a critical legal assessment on what the PM has agreed.\n\nDowning Street has said there are no plans for substantial changes to the deal.\n\nThe deal - known as the Windsor Framework - was agreed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the European Union (EU) last month to revise the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.\n\nIt replaces the Northern Ireland Protocol, which led to disagreements between the UK and EU over trade rules.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been refusing to take part in the devolved government in Northern Ireland until its concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved.\n\nMr Sunak hailed his deal as a \"decisive breakthrough\" and many Conservative MPs, including those who supported Brexit, gave their backing to the agreement.\n\nBut his solution has now been heavily criticised by the two groups he wanted to win over the most, the ERG and the DUP, which is the biggest unionist party in Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Sunak has been under pressure to secure their backing and restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland in time for the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in April.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to visit Northern Ireland next month to mark the agreement, which ended decades of conflict on the island.\n\nThe ERG's legal analysis may embolden Brexit-backing Conservative MPs to rebel against the government in Wednesday's vote on the Stormont brake aspect of the deal.\n\nThe Stormont brake mechanism aims to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a greater say on how EU laws apply to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DUP has already said it will vote against the government's Brexit plans this week. But the government is still expected to win the vote with the support of Labour, who have backed the deal.\n\nLegal experts have advised the ERG that EU law will \"still be supreme\" in Northern Ireland under the deal.\n\nThe analysis is based on the verdict of a so-called \"star chamber\" of lawyers hired by the ERG to pore over the details of the deal.\n\nEven though the lawyers advised the ERG that the Stormont brake was \"practically useless\", the group has declined to say whether they will vote against Mr Sunak's deal or not.\n\nERG chairman Mark Francois told journalists that the \"group hasn't taken the decision yet\" and it would be \"down to individuals\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman rejected the ERG's criticism of the Stormont brake mechanism, saying it \"addresses the democratic deficit and provides a clear democratic safeguard for the people of Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"It covers all the rules that could cause issues for Northern Ireland and is a matter for the UK alone, with no role for the European Union in deciding when the brake is used or agreeing whether the rule is disapplied,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brussels, EU member states have approved key parts of the Windsor Framework.\n\nThey handed the European Commission - the EU's executive - a mandate to bring forward the relevant changes on customs, VAT and the Stormont brake.\n\nThe EU-UK body which oversees the Northern Ireland Brexit deal is due to meet on Friday to formally ratify the legal changes.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I did not do so as I was concerned that what was being asked of me was not within Parliamentary rules.\n\n\"I contacted the Commons Registrar and the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner who clarified these rules for me and had no further contact with the company. I did this before being made aware that the company did not exist and the individuals claiming to represent it were journalists.\"\n\nThe UK Parliament's code of conduct prohibits MPs from lobbying in return for payment.\n\nThe code of conduct says MPs may not speak in the House of Commons and make approaches to ministers in return for payment.\n\nA spokesperson for Chief Whip Simon Hart said: \"Following his self-referral to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards earlier this evening [Wednesday], Scott Benton has had the Conservative Party Whip suspended whilst an investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is an independent officer who investigates allegations that MPs have breached the code of conduct.\n\nFollowing investigation, if they think the allegation represents a breach of the code, they can put such cases before MPs sitting on the Committee on Standards, who can decide any sanctions.\n\nEarlier, Labour and the Liberal Democrats had urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to suspend Mr Benton from the parliamentary Conservative Party.\n\nLabour's shadow justice secretary Steve Reed told the BBC it was \"absolutely wrong for any MP to be trying to serve themselves rather than serve their constituents\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said if Mr Benton's whip was not removed by Mr Sunak, it would \"make a mockery of his claim to restore integrity\".\n\nThe rules around lobbying in Parliament were tightened up in an updated version of the code of conduct, which published in February following the controversy over paid advocacy work undertaken by former MP Owen Paterson.\n\nThe Times investigation comes after a similar sting operation set up by Led By Donkeys, a political campaign group.\n\nSenior MPs, including former cabinet ministers Matt Hancock and Kwasi Kwarteng, were filmed agreeing to work for a fake company for thousands of pounds a day.

The worst waiting times in A&E for over a decade. Patients left for hours on trolleys. Vital cancer operations being cancelled. Hospitals across the country declaring major alerts. A humanitarian crisis in the making, says the Red Cross.\n\nBut amid all this what we haven't heard is just how well the health service is coping. Given what it is facing, the NHS and, in particular, hospitals are performing miracles.\n\nHow? Let me explain. The NHS is in the middle of the most sustained squeeze on its funding in its history. Until 2010, the budget increased by an average of about 4% a year once inflation is taken into account to help it cope with rising pressures.\n\nSince then, the average annual rise has been around 1% - and that will continue until 2020. The only period that comes close is the early 1950s when there was a cut in the NHS budget, prompting charging to be brought in for dentistry, prescriptions and spectacles.\n\nAnd that was pretty quickly followed by large cash injections to get the NHS back on track.\n\nThere's nothing like that this time. Instead, the health service is being asked to carry on as normal with fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than many other developed countries - as the graphs below illustrate.\n\nNow international comparisons can be difficult. You could argue, for example, that Germany only has so many more beds because its counts long-stay beds reserved for elderly people in its health figures whereas in the NHS they come under the nursing home sector, which is separate.\n\nNonetheless they pose an interesting question: are we simply expecting too much of the NHS?\n\nAnita Charlesworth, a health economist at the Health Foundation think tank and former Treasury official, thinks so. She says the NHS is being asked to provide \"world class access\" without the corresponding levels of funding and staff.\n\nLooked at like that, it puts the recent performance in a slightly different light.\n\nFaced with rising numbers coming in the front door (A&E) and increasing difficulty getting patients out the back (because of cuts to social care services), hospitals in England have found themselves full-to-bursting.\n\nIn recent weeks, bed occupancy rates have hit 95%. Now that may not sound like the definition of being full, but it is well above the 85% recommended threshold for a hospital to work effectively.\n\nAbove this level hospitals start to unravel, patients end up in the wrong places, infection rates start to rise and a backlog of patients builds up in corridors, in A&E and outside in ambulances dropping patients off.\n\nYes, some of this has started happening, but in many respects you would have expected performance to deteriorate even more than it has.\n\nDuring the first week of the year - the most difficult so far this winter - more than three-quarters of patients arriving in A&E were still seen in four hours.\n\nYes the rate of-called \"trolley waits\" - where patients admitted as an emergency are left waiting more than four hours for a bed - doubled to one in five patients. But the number of \"dire\" 12-hour waits only amounted to 0.5%.\n\nA week later bed occupancy rates had risen slightly - and guess what happened? Performance actually improved on many measures.\n\nAsk anybody working in the health service and they will say this is down to the dedication and hard work of hospital staff.\n\nLord Kerslake, chairman of King's College Hospital in London and a former senior civil servant, has described the efforts of staff at his hospital as \"extraordinary\", while the BBC coverage over the past week or so has been full of doctors, nurses and managers recounting how everyone is pulling together.\n\nBut there is more to it than that. The NHS has become very adept at managing pressure points. Daily reports are sent from hospitals to NHS Improvement, a newly-created regulator, about everything from the number of ambulances queuing outside A&Es to how many patients are stuck on trolleys inside.\n\nIt means when there is a problem resources are immediately deployed by bosses at the centre.\n\nExtra managers are deployed, GPs and council care staff geed up and beds at local nursing homes used to move patients out of hospital.\n\nThe result has been that the NHS has been able to - by and large - prevent the situation spiralling completely out of control and into a full-blown national crisis.\n\nThose involved in the process speak in admiration of the way the regulator", "PPL": 1.919341802597046, "PPL/lower": 0.9770030630623852, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005232665764986494, "Min-5%": 9.505751792122336, "Min-10%": 7.929992654744317, "Min-20%": 6.208977891646854, "Min-30%": 5.122739629170794, "Min-40%": 4.326064935814781, "Min-50%": 3.6818645331400464, "Min-60%": 3.1558365199824108}, {"text": "\n\nLondon was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War.\n\nAn exhibition at Bletchley Park tells the story of the Zimmermann Telegram\n\nWhen the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram.\n\nRoom 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram.\n\nBritain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends.\n\nBritain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War.\n\nEventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London.\n\nThis meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" President Wilson said when he was told of the details.\n\nThe telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation).\n\nWhatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it.

The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland.\n\nSorry, your browser does not support this tool How polluted is your street?\n\nIf you cannot view the postcode search, please click here to reload the page.\n\nAlthough dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems.\n\nA new analysis by the company EarthSense shows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain.\n\n\"By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions.\"\n\nAir pollution levels in London could stay above legal limits for the next decade if action isn't taken\n\nProf Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside.\n\n\"Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries - particularly across Asia.\n\n\"In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas.\"\n\nIn the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1).\n\nThe scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.\n\nFewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.\n\nThree-quarters of the postcodes with the worst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways.\n\nThree-quarters of the postcodes which reach level five out of six are in London\n\nThe company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK", "PPL": 1.8927764892578125, "PPL/lower": 0.9531385282749595, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005122534477017083, "Min-5%": 9.324211059832106, "Min-10%": 7.835278106670754, "Min-20%": 6.143808526339916, "Min-30%": 5.056988399269526, "Min-40%": 4.258262930260311, "Min-50%": 3.6272913764066126, "Min-60%": 3.112381130966573}, {"text": "partnership work of Police Scotland, Fisheries Management Scotland and District Salmon Fisheries Boards.\n\n\"Conversely, it is disappointing to note an increase in hunting with dogs offences.

At this stage there is no evidence of any malicious exploitation and patches are being produced for the major platforms.\"\n\n\"The NCSC advises that all organisations and home users continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.\"\n\nThe flaw is also likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure and Google, according to The Register, which broke news of the bug.\n\nShares in Intel were down almost 6% in US trading after the issue was revealed, and ended the trading session close 3.4% lower.\n\n\"It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\n\"The actual flaw is being rather tightly kept under wraps but from what researchers have gleaned themselves, it's all to do with a flaw in the way certain Intel CPUs address certain types of memory.\n\n\"If it is really bad then it may allow an exploit to read parts of the computer memory that should never be reached.\"\n\nAndy Tsege has not seen his wife or three children since his arrest in 2014\n\nThe wife of a British man imprisoned in Ethiopia has said she feels \"optimistic\" after the government said it would free its political prisoners.\n\nOpposition activist Andargachew 'Andy' Tsege was seized nearly four years ago in Yemen and taken to Ethiopia.\n\nHis wife Yemi Hailemariam, who lives in Islington, north London, told the BBC she is \"hopeful\" but has her doubts until she hears more.\n\nIt was unclear from Hailemariam Desalegn's surprise announcement exactly who will be released or when it will happen.\n\nMr Andargachew, a UK national, has been in prison in Ethiopia since being arrested during a stopover at a Yemen airport in June 2014.\n\nThe father of three was sentenced to death while in exile for plotting a coup - which he denied.\n\nMr Andargachew had been secretary-general of Ethiopia's banned Ginbot 7", "PPL": 1.7815312147140503, "PPL/lower": 0.9110503767236924, "PPL/zlib": 0.00047736634906592987, "Min-5%": 8.587153079462986, "Min-10%": 7.24896447798785, "Min-20%": 5.678122674923363, "Min-30%": 4.718343302631845, "Min-40%": 3.985921749713077, "Min-50%": 3.405153913290503, "Min-60%": 2.929985639081316}, {"text": "He may have been the heir to Blair, but he did not inherit the Blair spin machine.\n\nOr rather he believed that if he appealed directly to the people they would listen to what he had to say and respect his wisdom.\n\nTheresa May has been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself\n\nIn the end that was to bring him down with the EU referendum result.\n\nSo now, another \"new dawn\", another prime minister, another approach to getting the message across.\n\nTheresa May told us she won't give a running commentary on Brexit.

the economy and the supremacy of London as Europe's financial capital being two of them.\n\nBut the rest of the European Union also faces risks.\n\nAnd, according to the governor, those risks are greater for the continent.\n\nTo be clear, Mr Carney was talking about financial stability, not economic growth - although of course the two are closely intertwined.\n\nIf financial stability is compromised, or liquidity conditions deteriorate, then economic growth is likely to be adversely affected.\n\nIn his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney made three major points.\n\nFirst, the UK's financial services sector provides 75% of foreign exchange trading for the EU, 75% of all hedging products (which help businesses insure against risk when making investments or buying products) and supports half of all lending.\n\nAs he said in November, the UK is Europe's \"investment banker\".\n\nA sharp break in that liquidity and capacity support could be detrimental to financial stability in the EU.\n\nAlex Brazier, the executive director for financial stability at the Bank, said that the UK exports \u00a326bn of financial services to the EU, and imports just \u00a33bn.\n\nWhich, he said, makes the point.\n\nSecond, as far as the UK is concerned, Brexit is no longer the biggest risk to financial stability.\n\nNow, that may be leapt on by the Bank's critics - the governor has changed his tune, it could be said, given that before the referendum Brexit was seen as the biggest risk.\n\nMr Carney said the UK economy is performing better than expected\n\nBut Mr Carney made it clear - the mitigating actions the Bank has taken since the referendum (a cut in interest rates and more financial support for banks and businesses) have, according to the governor, worked.\n\nBetter economic news than many predicted has also maintained confidence - and the governor suggested that the Bank was now looking at upgrading the UK economic forecasts for 2017.\n\nThird, transitional arrangements would be a positive help to smoothing the process of Brexit, avoiding what has been described as a \"cliff edge\" exit which may occur at the end of the two year Article 50 process.\n\nMany in the City believe that given the complexities of the financial relationships between London and the rest of Europe, two years will simply not be enough time to build new regulatory and financial structures.\n\nA period of \"adaption\" will be necessary.\n\nMr Carney's comments are likely to be welcomed in Number 10 and the Treasury.\n\nThe government believes that, whatever the present noises about the toughness of the EU position on Brexit flexibility, the role London plays in supporting the rest of the EU economy will be an important part of the negotiations.\n\nBusiness leaders across the EU will want to maintain full access to UK's deep financial markets and widespread expertise.\n\nAnd that will help Theresa May's push for the \"closest trading relationship\" with the EU, even if Britain does leave the single market as it is presently constituted.\n\nSome believe this a forlorn hope, suggesting that political positions in the EU are hardening, not softening, towards the UK.\n\nBut, the more the warnings come from people like Mr Carney that Europe might just need the UK's financial muscle, the stronger Mrs May's negotiating hand will be.\n\nLast updated on .From the section European Football\n\nBarcelona's ability to offer Lionel Messi an improved contract will rest on their capacity to raise revenue from sponsorship deals and player sales, chief executive Oscar Grau says.\n\nMessi's contract expires in 2018 and he is expected to command a new deal on a par with the reported \u00a321m a year earned by Luis Suarez and Neymar.\n\nBut La Liga's salary cap means Barca must exercise common sense, Grau said.\n\n\"We want the best players but perhaps we have to prioritise,\" he added.\n\nLa Liga agrees budgetary limits with each club at the start of every season, which prevents boards from spending more than 70% of their budget on wages.\n\nThe big-money contracts awarded to Messi's fellow forwards Suarez and Neymar, which run until 2021, eat into a significant part of their wage budget, which must also absorb an average player sal", "PPL": 1.9312701225280762, "PPL/lower": 0.9358436322914665, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005187402961396928, "Min-5%": 9.129857717775831, "Min-10%": 7.701356665760863, "Min-20%": 6.147873413883387, "Min-30%": 5.091853630659246, "Min-40%": 4.313617598019485, "Min-50%": 3.6924697874461683, "Min-60%": 3.172729234887645}, {"text": "Davos last week.\n\nAsked why consumer confidence hadn't collapsed following the referendum -

a judgement at its most basic on how a million different decisions by human beings will play out.\n\nThe rate of inflation is increasing as the value of sterling declines.\n\nJobs are being moved out of the UK and on to the continent in sectors such as banking and finance as businesses prepare for Brexit.\n\nThe UK has, of course, not actually left the EU yet and at the moment is enjoying the stimulus of being in the EU's huge single market with a considerably weaker currency.\n\nThat goldilocks situation will not last and the chancellor told me of his concerns about business investment.\n\nIt was the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that shocks to an economy can boost growth.\n\n\"Creative destruction\" may be a little strong to describe the Brexit vote, but innovation can flow when the demands of uncertainty rise.\n\nAfter Britain fell out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor of the single currency, many predicted that inflation would rise and economic growth would stutter.\n\nIn fact, the UK economy bounced back, inflation remained in check and the pound rose - after an initial fall.\n\nThat is not to say that all \"dynamic\" shocks have such an effect.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008-09 has negatively affected economic growth for far longer than most expected as the financial services sector contracted rapidly, liquidity disappeared and businesses and consumers paid down debt.\n\nThat is why it is still too early to say definitively whether the robust state of the UK economy today means the forecasts for economic pain made before the Brexit vote can now be safely ignored.\n\nJavaScript seems to be disabled.

Everyone in the unit executed the plans we talked about. We showed a lot of experience.\n\n\"The opening batsmen got off to a flier and that releases any pressure on the guys coming in after them.

Has it blinked in the past? There are no exact comparisons, because Brexit is a unique situation. But here are a few examples:\n\nDenmark narrowly rejected the EU's Maastricht treaty in 1992 and subsequently negotiated four optouts from Maastricht on:\n\nThe optouts were contained in a legally binding protocol to the treaty but the main body of the text was not changed.\n\nIn a second referendum, in 1993, Denmark voted in favour.\n\nIreland has lived through two referendums on the same issue on two separate occasions.\n\nIn 2001, the country voted against the EU's Nice Treaty, mainly because voters were concerned that Irish military forces would have to take part in Nato-led peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe text of the treaty was not changed but the Irish government issued a national declaration reaffirming its military neutrality.\n\nIn a second referendum in 2002, the Nice Treaty was approved by an overwhelming margin.\n\nAgain, in 2008, Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty, citing concerns about tax, abortion and military neutrality.\n\nA second referendum, in 2009, approved Lisbon after promises were made to address these concerns.\n\nThey eventually formed a protocol that was approved in 2012 but the text of the Lisbon Treaty itself was not changed.\n\nIn 2016 an advisory referendum in the Netherlands rejected an EU trade and cooperation agreement with Ukraine. The Dutch government needed legally binding assurances from the rest of the EU before it could get the deal approved in parliament, and it got them.\n\nThey came in the form of a declaration spelling out the fact that the agreement did not make any guarantee to Ukraine of future EU membership, nor did it oblige the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with military assistance.\n\nBut the agreement with Ukraine was not changed in any way, and an equivalent outcome for the Brexit deal would fail to satisfy many Eurosceptic MPs in Westminster.\n\nA draft EU constitution was signed by all member states in October 2004 and ratified by 18 countries before being rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005.\n\nAfter licking a few wounds, the EU came up with the Lisbon Treaty, which kept many of the main provisions of the draft constitution, including a new president of the European Council and a clause on withdrawal from the EU (Article 50).\n\nBut it dropped the name \"constitution\" itself and it didn't include references to EU symbols, such as the flag and the anthem, that would normally be associated with a state.\n\nThe rejection of the constitution led to what were probably the biggest changes the EU has ever made in treaty negotiations but critics say Lisbon was still as close to the proposed constitution as it could get.\n\nBefore Brexit, the EU was dealing for years with the eurozone crisis and with Greece in particular.\n\nGreece was pushed into a financial bailout programme in 2010, accepting huge loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for drastic austerity measures, including tax rises and sweeping cuts in spending and pay.\n\nAfter a new government led by the radical left-wing party Syriza took office in 2015, it held a referendum in which it campaigned for an end to EU-imposed austerity.\n\nDespite substantial backing from Greek voters, Brussels (and Berlin) didn't blink.\n\nAusterity continued and the government had to apply for another bailout loan in order to stay in the eurozone.\n\nIn the run-up to the Brexit referendum in the UK, the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, tried to renegotiate aspects of the UK's membership of the European Union, in order to show voters that reform was possible.\n\nHe won recognition that the UK could opt out of the EU's founding ambition to forge an \"ever closer union\" and he was given guarantees about the rights of EU countries outside the", "PPL": 1.8276007175445557, "PPL/lower": 0.9529770552406253, "PPL/zlib": 0.00048298116214179587, "Min-5%": 8.777495393566056, "Min-10%": 7.509019900770748, "Min-20%": 5.9049481214695865, "Min-30%": 4.880410002574859, "Min-40%": 4.1074135858738625, "Min-50%": 3.5000523665550283, "Min-60%": 3.0037761228432096}, {"text": "no-score draw on nuclear weapons,\" added the shadow minister. \"Jeremy can be budged. Sometimes. But it takes a hell of an effort and a lot of time.\"\n\nHe was right, of course. Mr Corbyn now accepts, however unenthusiastically, that NATO is a defence alliance Britain must back and not merely a hangover from the cold war.\n\nHe has put aside his dream of Labour returning to a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He is still adamant that he would never order a nuclear strike, a flat contradiction to the principal of nuclear deterrence which Labour has yet to confront.\n\nHe has moved, nonetheless. His position, if not his thinking, has changed.\n\nNow he talks of free movement as a possible component of an EU divorce settlement still to be negotiated. That's a long way from the thinking of shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, who expressed sympathy, when I interviewed him on my Sunday morning 5 live programme, Pienaar's Politics, for the idea of limiting access to the UK jobs market to EU migrants who have a job guaranteed.\n\nBut it opened at least the possibility of further movement in future. Only a possibility, mind. The Labour leader is stubborn. Or a man of deep conviction. Take your choice.\n\nThe enthusiasts who elected and continue to sustain Mr Corbyn continue to be zealous and loyal. Supporters of free movement of people as a useful, as well as necessary element of the EU single market may welcome Mr Corbyn's reluctance to forsake them.\n\nBut a lot of Labour MPs have moved from bitter resentment to weary fatalism, hoping that, somehow, the mood among party members changes sufficiently to produce a change. Preferably a change of leader.\n\nThese include the senior Labour MP who told me privately today that his constituency - a northern stronghold with a majority of around 15,000 - now felt like a marginal seat, vulnerable to the overtures of UKIP.\n\nSome allies of Mr Corbyn had grown resentful that the mainstream media appeared to have lost interest in reporting the doings of Labour, or analysing the party's policy development.\n\nNo-one can make the same complaint today.

But there is a much bigger story going on here.\n\nThe man behind a deal to potentially take these titles off Richard Desmond is none other than David Montgomery, the former editor of the News of the World and Today who went on to become a major investor in media.\n\nOver recent months, Montgomery has been trying to raise the necessary finances, speaking to several banks, as well as equity partners.\n\nMontgomery is being advised by Lloyds, Bank of Canada, and the familiar figure of Jonnie Goodwin of Lepe Partners.\n\nBefore Christmas, he had raised \u00a3125m. This comprises \u00a360m of debt finance, \u00a310m from Montgomery, \u00a330m from other equity backers - and \u00a325m from Trinity Mirror.\n\nMark Kleinman of Sky News has reported that the investors Montgomery is speaking to include Towebrook Capital Partners. I have not been able to verify this yet myself.\n\nRichard Desmond, who bought the Express titles in 2000, spoke to me about his intentions.\n\nIn May last year, Express Newspapers, which is part of Northern & Shell, announced it had tripled pre-tax profits in 2015 to \u00a330.5m.\n\nDesmond told me that with OK! Magazine doing well, and his printworks in Luton owning assets now worth \"around \u00a3100m\", Express Newspapers was making around \u00a350m.\n\nI asked Desmond if he was intent on selling to Montgomery and had received an offer.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk, nothing has happened. I haven't had an offer.\" Asked specifically if he wished to sell Express Newspapers, Desmond said: \"Why would I? You tell me, why would I?\"\n\nBut he swiftly added that he was \"interested in everything\".\n\nAsked if he would demand a five-times multiple of profits for Express Newspapers, he said: \"Why wouldn't I?\"\n\nDesmond hasn't seen Montgomery since his Christmas party. \"My people have been speaking loads to his management.\"\n\nHis preference, as things stand, is to consolidate back-office staff rather than sell Express Newspapers - though he would, of course, entertain the latter option if he was offered a suitable price.\n\n\"If we can bring in a minority partner to share back-office staff, that could save tens of millions,\" he added.\n\nHe specifically referred to \"IT, ad sales\" in reference to these back-office operations.\n\nUsing what were clearly ballpark figures on a deal that hasn't yet transpired, about an entity not yet clearly defined, Desmond told me the savings for Trinity Mirror of a combined company could be around \u00a330m, and for Desmond they could be around \u00a360m.\n\n\"If Trinity then owned 20% of the new company, which should make \u00a380m, that's \u00a316m.\"\n\nI should urge caution about these figures, because Desmond himself did: when I asked what exactly would make \u00a380m, he was open that this was a generalisation about a possible future company.\n\nDesmond is a brilliant deal-maker who sold Channel 5 to Viacom for \u00a3463m in 2014, having bought it in 2010 for just \u00a3103.5m.\n\nBy the way, Viacom has had an excellent two years with Channel 5, with ratings up, in the years since that sale.\n\nHe didn't give me the impression he is keen to get out of media in a hurry.\n\nI asked David Montgomery if the above figures were accurate and indeed whether he was being advised by those I mention above.\n\nAt the time of writing he hadn't responded to my queries.\n\nI asked a Trinity Mirror PLC spokesman whether the \u00a325m figure was accurate.\n\nI have spoken to multiple sources across the industry about the likelihood of a deal going through between Montgomery and Desmond. As things stand, it is very uncertain.\n\nDesmond won't sell for a knockdown price: after all, he has stable profits.\n\nAnd any consolidation of back-office operations depends on a huge range of specifics that are yet to be hammered out.\n\nBut as I have repeatedly said on this blog, there is a coming consolidation in the media sector, and indeed in over-supplied sub-sectors such as that of national newspapers in Britain.\n\nBy over-supplied I simply mean we have plenty for an island with our population.\n\nExpect more on this soon.

This is because, as a woman, I get far more rights as a working mother than he would as a working father.\n\n\"I am entitled to flexible working and have more legal rights. I work 36 hours a week and he works between 16 and 18, split over a Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon which means we are at home together on a Saturday and our son only has to go to a nursery for one afternoon a week.\n\n\"It's been eight months and it's working so far. Dan is happy because he is at home with our son and also has a job so he feels like he is contributing to our income and Louis (our son) is happy because he has a parent at home during the week.\n\n\"We earn enough to get by and get no help from the state with our son other than child benefit.\"\n\n\"In my role, it's really hard to find a healthy work-life-balance. In a lot of companies you will get benefits, such as salary increase based on the effort you invest into your job. If you are not focused on your career, then you will get no increase or not the amount that would be needed.\n\n\"If you are focused just on your career you will miss beautiful moments with your child.\n\n\"If you would like to spend more time taking care of your child, you have to work hard. Then it becomes a circle, like an infinite loop, that you cannot close.\n\n\"Some people advise to either not work that hard or to move to another company, but this is nonsense. Why? Because your family needs money. More money comes from higher appreciation at work. This comes from more hard work. However, it will also reduce the time you have for your family.\n\n\"In addition, the parental leave we have here in Hungary is near to nothing. We get two days of parental leave per year per child, which is not enough. Salary increases are also not a trend here, at least not in my case.\"\n\n\"I jumped off the career ladder about five or six years ago - a decision taken with my wife to effectively swap roles; she'd worked part-time since the first of our two sons was born.\n\n\"She wanted to get back to her career, and I was painfully aware of missing out on being around my boys. We had enough cash to fall back on that my not working for a while wouldn't cause problems and then I started working part-time from home as a writer.\n\n\"There are a lot of unexpected barriers and challenges when you're a stay-at-home dad - they almost all boil down to other people's attitudes.\n\n\"It's important to accept that balance comes at a cost.\"\n\n\"When the time came that I wanted to get back to work I met some almost hostile responses. Many people struggled to accept that a man would want to spend more time at home with his kids for a while.\n\n\"I asked a few of them 'would you be so negative in the face of a woman returning to work after a prolonged child-related career break?' The answer was always 'no' and was often followed by an uncomfortable acceptance that they were regarding me differently solely because of my gender.\n\n\"It's a real eye-opener into tacit acceptance of gender-defined roles in society.

But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,\" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul.\n\nHer case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries.\n\nIt has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced.\n\nNow sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope.\n\nShe says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for \"not having proper documents to stay\".\n\nTwo days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison.\n\nSharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison\n\nPakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave.\n\nSharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left.\n\n\"I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card.\"\n\nShe served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C.\n\n\"This was the hardest and worst incident in my life.\"\n\nRealising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused.\n\n\"I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough.\"\n\nHer husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there.\n\n\"If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in.\"\n\nThe \"Afghan Girl\" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed.\n\nFor years she was unaware of her celebrity.\n\n\"When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo.\"\n\n\"I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy.\"\n\nSharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul\n\nNone of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes.\n\nBut her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green.\n\nShe says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour.\n\nSharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979.\n\n\"There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done.\"\n\nHer mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar.\n\nShe was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago. Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter.\n\nSharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\"They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me.

So why not approach Jaguar's advertising agency and offer them the chance to make a commercial based on the video?\n\nThe Jaguar S-Type was in production from 1999 to 2009\n\n\"He was actually in the commercial,\" says Matt Bristow, who is business affairs manager at independent UK record label Cherry Red. \"If you had gone back to Sting in the 80s and said, 'Would you fancy being in a car commercial?', he would probably have said no.\"\n\nAfter that, the single reached the top 20 in 10 countries, including the UK and the US. And since then, sync deals placing music tracks in TV commercials, TV series, films and even video games have become steadily more important as a revenue earner for the music industry.\n\nWith record companies unable to sell physical copies of their releases in the same quantities that they used to, they have sought other sources of revenue, and sync licensing is now one of the key ones.\n\nAs a result, previously obscure job categories have come to the fore as the industry rebalances to reflect this. The 21st Century has seen the rise of music supervisors, people who oversee the process of finding the right song for a scene and making sure the right people get paid for it.\n\nThese are the gatekeepers who decide which tunes you will be hearing in that latest hit TV show, the essential liaison between the creative types who make the programme and the business people who control ownership of the music.\n\nCherry Red, like other record companies, fosters relationships with music supervisors and does whatever it can to make them aware of the music it has to offer.\n\nThe Netflix series Stranger Things features one of Cherry Red's tracks\n\n\"If you go back a decade or more, I think certainly the bigger artists were not very receptive to these kinds of licences,\" says Mr Bristow. \"When a thriving physical market was still with us, there was a view that you were selling out if you did that.\n\n\"But that's changed. There's more awareness of the importance of maximising your income.\n\n\"The door has definitely been opened. Artists at all levels are more receptive to doing these kinds of deals than in the past.\"\n\nCherry Red's most notable success in sync licensing to date has been placing a song on the soundtrack on the hit Netflix show Stranger Things, which successfully applied to use the track Green Desert by German electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream.\n\n\"The approach came from Nora Felder, who is well known in the music sync world as a passionate music supervisor,\" says Mr Bristow.\n\n\"We didn't haggle over the fee,\" he adds. \"Obviously I can't tell you what it was, but it was comfortably in the ballpark of what that sort of deal would be.\"\n\nIn this case, approval was required from the recording artists. Since Tangerine Dream's frontman Edgar Froese died in 2015, his widow Bianca was the one who gave it the green light.\n\nBut the deal was not sealed until the final cut of the scene using the music had been signed off by the show's creators, at which point Cherry Red was able to invoice them for the money.\n\nTangerine Dream's Edgar Froese died in 2015 at the age of 70\n\n\"That's really great for us, it's like having a calling card when we go and see other music supervisors,\" says Mr Bristow. \"When we say we've got a track on Stranger Things, they immediately know what we're talking about.\"\n\nWhen music supervisors are seeking to obtain permission to use a track, they need to clear two different sets of rights: the rights to use the actual recorded piece of music, known as the \"master rights\", and the rights to use the written composition, or the \"publishing rights\".\n\n\"It's very attractive in the sync world when you control both rights and they can just clear with you,\" says Mr Bristow. \"It's a one-stop shop when you control both rights.\"\n\nWhen Cherry Red signs a new artist these days, the label is seeking to acquire both master and publishing rights.\n\nHowever, music publishers and record companies have different priorities and it can be hard for one firm to give equal weight to both.\n\nAs a result, musicians have traditionally been reluctant to put all their eggs in one basket, so that's another way in which the industry is having to change.\n\n\"It's an old adage that you don't put your masters and publishing in the same place. It's historically the unwritten rule in the artists' community,\" says Mr Bristow.\n\nAt present, Cherry Red controls the master rights of about 50,000 tracks and the publishing rights of about 16,000.

Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their lives.\n\nThe 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends.\n\nThey go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the \"haunted\" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body.\n\nPaul is visibly shocked by the discovery but also makes jokes.\n\nThe group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out.\n\nA member of the group is heard off camera saying he \"doesn't feel good\". Paul then asks him: \"What, you never stand next to a dead guy?\" He then laughs.\n\nThe identity of the deceased man is not known.\n\nOnline comments have widely accused Paul of acting inappropriately and being disrespectful. A petition calling for his entire channel to be removed from YouTube has more than 45,000 signatures.\n\nIn Japan, the reaction has been similar with many saying they are disgusted and appalled by the stupidity of his actions. Although some have pointed out that Japanese media have in the past sent camera crews and TV personalities to supposedly \"haunted\" locations.\n\nOne Twitter user said it was more important to talk about the high rates of suicide in Japan.\n\n\"Even if we try to sweep it under the rug, it doesn't change the fact that Japan is a nation prominent for suicides where 20,000 to 30,000 people commit suicide every year,\" wrote Namaikinanamako.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

A large number of studies of hospital management have demonstrated how, when there are few spare hospital beds, even very modest further reductions in the number of free beds can dramatically increase the likelihood of any given patient being caught in a hospital backlog, which can lead to significant delays in care.\n\nThat high utilisation rate is why, in addition to the elevated rate of trolley waits, there were 177 cancelled operations. That figure is much higher than the previous week, but is likely to be distorted because of the Bank Holiday. The rate at which operations was being cancelled also fell during the week.\n\nThe strain on the service will have been eased because of the expected fall in traffic over the second week of the year, with average daily A&E attendances dropping from 50,993 in the first week of the year to 47,195 in the second.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England added: \"We started planning for winter this year earlier than ever before and will continue to do everything we can to ensure the best care possible is being delivered.\"\n\nExperts are renewing calls to allow experiments on embryos beyond 14 days of development, saying it would drive medical breakthroughs.\n\nResearch on human embryos can only happen under a licence in the UK and it is currently illegal to keep them alive in laboratories for more than two weeks after fertilisation.\n\nUntil recently, this cut-off was almost irrelevant in terms of viability since science had not found a way to physically support life in the lab beyond about a week.\n\nBut researchers have found a way to chemically mimic the womb which would allow an early stage embryo to continue to develop for longer - at least 13 days after fertilisation, but potentially much more.\n\nOne of the pioneers of IVF is calling for a government inquiry.\n\nProf Simon Fishel was on the team involved with the birth of the world's first IVF baby. He believes that moving the limit to 28 days would be good for furthering scientific understanding.\n\nProf Fishel, who founded the CARE Fertility Group, said: \"I believe the benefits we will gain by eventually moving forwards when the case is proven will be of enormous importance to human health.\"\n\nObserving how the embryo changes over weeks could shed light on why some early miscarriages occur, he says.\n\nEmbryos normally implant in the wall of the uterus at around day seven and still resemble a ball of cells at that stage.\n\nIt takes weeks of rapid cell division and growth before it begins to resemble something more baby-like, with a beating heart, developing eyes and budding limbs.\n\nMagdalena Zernicka-Goetz has developed a technique that could, theoretically, allow embryos to survive for longer in the lab than the current legal limit of 14 days.\n\nThe Cambridge University professor says: \"We know that a lot of pregnancies fail on the time of implantation which is day seven. So now we can identify events which are not happening correctly and how in future we can help them occur normally.\"\n\nBut there are many who are concerned about extending the legal limit.\n\nProf Fishel said: \"There are some religious groups that will be fundamentally against IVF, let alone IVF research in any circumstances, and we have to respect their views.\"\n\nThe 14-day rule was first suggested in the UK in 1984. With the advent of IVF, a committee, chaired by Mary Warnock, was set up to look at the ethics and regulation of this new technology.\n\nIt concluded that the human embryo should be protected, but that research on embryos and IVF would be permissible, given appropriate safeguards.\n\nSetting a cut-off was tricky. For example, should it be based on when an embryo develops a nervous system that might begin to detect pain? At the time, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested 17 days as a limit - the point at which early neural development begins.\n\nThe Warnock report settled on 14 days - when the embryo is a distinct individual and can no longer form a twin.\n\nThat recommendation is now decades old. Some say it should be reviewed.\n\nDavid Jones, founder of the Centre of Bioethics and Emerging Technologies, is against changing the limit.\n\n\"It would be a stepping stone to the culturing of embryos and even foetuses outside the womb. You are really beyond the stage when the embryo would otherwise implant and that is a step towards to creating womb like environment outside. People will then ask why can't we shift it beyond 28 days?\"\n\nA recent YouGov poll of 1,740, commissioned by the BBC, found that 48% of the UK general public supported increasing the limit up to 28 days, 19% wanted to keep the present limit of 14 days and 10% wanted a total ban.\n\nBut one in four of those questioned said they did not know, suggesting some may need more information to reach an informed opinion.\n\nBBC Radio 4's two-part documentary 'Revisiting the 14 day rule' starts on Tuesday 17 January at 11:00 GMT.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Football\n\nThe Football Association is looking at introducing retrospective bans to English football for players who dive or feign injury.\n\nOfficials will go on a fact-finding trip to Scotland, where retrospective bans are already used.\n\nIn England, players are currently only given retrospective bans for incidents of violent conduct.\n\nIt is understood a rule change would require agreement from all football governing bodies in England.\n\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche believes diving would be eradicated from football \"in six months\" with retrospective bans.\n\nAccording to a report in Tuesday's Times newspaper, senior figures at the FA are keen to press ahead with the move.\n\nDyche's comments come after two recent incidents in Premier League matches.\n\nRobert Snodgrass apologised for going down without contact to earn a penalty for Hull against Crystal Palace, while Dele Alli won a debated spot-kick in Tottenham's 5-0 win over Swansea.\n\nAt the start of the current season, Hearts' Jamie Walker was given a retrospective two-match ban for diving to win a penalty against Celtic in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nThe Scottish FA found him in breach of disciplinary rule 201 as the \"simulation caused a match official to make an incorrect decision\". The player contested the charge, but the compliance officer's verdict was upheld.\n\nUnder current Football Association rules in England, players who pretend to have been fouled should receive a caution for simulation, which comes under the category of unsporting behaviour, if the incident is spotted by the match officials.\n\nHowever, this can only occur during matches at the moment.\n\nThe question of how to deal with players who dive or cheat has long troubled English football.\n\nThe law which allows retrospective punishment in Scotland is being examined closely by FA chiefs.\n\nBut any changes in England would require agreement from the game's various stakeholders. That means the Professional Footballers' Association, League Managers Association, English Football League and Premier League would all need to reach a consensus.\n\nConcerns over player", "PPL": 2.0114471912384033, "PPL/lower": 0.9544918740095585, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005261436545222085, "Min-5%": 8.80208408131319, "Min-10%": 7.528120823934967, "Min-20%": 6.104099600705657, "Min-30%": 5.130509961311514, "Min-40%": 4.385633644818677, "Min-50%": 3.7859213706451893, "Min-60%": 3.281859255914579}, {"text": "a number of players now who have started individual leadership plans,\" Jones added. \"We will see those players develop over the next period of time.\"\n\nHaving skippered England to an unbeaten year in 2016, hooker Dylan Hartley will again captain the side in the Six Nations - fitness-permitting - with Jones highlighting playmaker Owen Farrell as a likely replacement should he be unavailable.\n\n\"Owen makes sure the standards are kept high, as does [fly-half] George Ford,\" Jones said. \"Certainly if Dylan wasn't ready Owen could be a very strong candidate.\"\n\nWith many hospitals close to full in these difficult winter weeks, there has been much debate about the resources available in the health service.\n\nPatient demand is rising faster than the budget increases allocated to the NHS in England.\n\nYet the number of hospital bed numbers has fallen steadily in recent years. So what is going on?\n\nThe total number of overnight hospital beds in England fell from 144,455 at the start of the 2010/11 financial year to 129,458 in the middle of 2016 (the last recorded figures). The number of day beds over that period increased from 11,783 to 12,480.\n\nLooking further back into history reveals a sharper rate of decline.\n\nThat current figure of overnight beds compares with almost 300,000 in 1987-88 according to figures from the Nuffield Trust.\n\nThere was a steep fall in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then a more static position between 2000 and 2005 and then a resumption of the downward curve.\n\nThe fall in bed numbers coincided with big changes in patterns of care.\n\nInstitutionalised mental health treatment gave way to more care in a patient's local community so fewer beds were needed.\n\nElderly care medicine changed too, with more older patients cared for closer to home.\n\nMedical advances meant that more patients could be treated as day cases.\n\nAverage stays in hospitals for those needing overnight beds have fallen. There was a similar trend in other healthcare systems.\n\nAs bed numbers fell in England, occupancy rates did not shoot up. This suggests that the health service has been more efficient with its care and dealing with more cases outside hospitals.\n\nOver the first three months of 2016 in England, 89% of beds were occupied on average compared to 86.6% over the same period in 2011.\n\nBut has the system reached a tipping point? Hospital bed occupancy rates have crept up to 95% in the first weeks of 2017.\n\nTrust chiefs have reported days when they have been literally full with a new patient admitted only when one has been discharged.\n\nBack in October 2014, a Nuffield Trust report noted that pressures were immense with demographic change and an ageing population the most significant drivers.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that if admission rates continue to rise, the NHS will need an additional 6.2m 'bed days' by 2022 - which equates to 22 hospitals with 800 beds each,\" it said.\n\nNuffield went on to say that building new hospitals was not the answer and that curbing demand had to be part of the solution along with more joined up health and social care to keep people out of hospital where possible.\n\nThat was their prognosis in 2014. Two-and-a-half years on there have been no obvious signs of progress.\n\nThe drive for efficiency savings will continue but the calls for more investment in the NHS have become louder.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Hospitals in England, Sir Mike Richards, told the BBC this week that he was \"very concerned\" about the degree of strain experienced by hospitals.\n\nHe continued by saying \"I believe the government will need to put more money into the NHS\" - though he added it was important the money was spent \"wisely\".\n\nThe budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) argued this week that it was inevitable that health spending would rise because of demographic factors and the advance of medical technology.\n\nThe OBR said health spending could rise from 6.9% of economic activity (GDP) in 2021 to 12.6% in 2066.\n\nThe watchdog noted this could put great strain on public finances unless governments raised taxes or cut spending elsewhere.\n\nMinisters argue they have given the NHS in England above inflation increases in funding through till 2020.\n\nThey also say that progress is being made at local level in joining up health and social care.\n\nBut the demands for more money will continue, including from some on the Conservative benches in the Commons.\n\nAnd questions will be asked about the wisdom of reducing bed numbers and whether that can be reversed.\n\nHave you used NHS services in 2017?

Four days later he had received his US visa, after charming the interviewer by saying he'd learned English by watching the \"two best documentaries on America\": The Simpsons and Seinfeld.\n\nThe reason for his swift departure was the beginning of the 2006 war.\n\nHis father ordered him to get out of Beirut and gave his son the family's life savings of $2,200 (\u00a31,785), asking only for him to leave \"$300 for food\".\n\nMr Haidar took his chance, managed to get to the border, and like many refugees after him, travelled through Syria, Turkey and Germany before finally flying to the US and getting a job in a Detroit petrol station.\n\nThe rest was another example of the American Dream come true.

But here we will focus on the situation of Britons living in another EU country (in the EU27).\n\nAbout 1.3m UK-born people are resident in the EU27, while the UK hosts about 3.2m EU27 nationals.\n\nThe withdrawal deal would enable them to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights, until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period ends.\n\nAs for no deal, there is huge uncertainty about what it will mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThe priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.\n\nThe European Commission, in its contingency plan for no-deal Brexit, urges the EU27 to \"take a generous approach to the rights of UK citizens in the EU, provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK\".\n\nIt says the EU27 \"should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status\".\n\nThere is uncertainty over how a no deal would affect flights in Europe\n\nThe Commission - the EU executive - has proposed visa-free travel for British visitors to the EU, provided the UK reciprocates.\n\nUnder the political declaration agreed alongside the withdrawal deal the UK says \"the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply\" after the transition.\n\nIt speaks of \"non-discrimination\" and \"full reciprocity\" and says both sides \"aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits\".\n\nHowever, that declaration is not legally binding; it spells out ambitions for the future UK-EU relationship, yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder no deal, the declaration would be null and void. The UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a \"third country\" like other non-EU states.\n\nSo the rules for Britons in the EU could well be the same as for Americans or Chinese - it will depend on the rules of the individual member states.\n\nSome of them have announced interim measures to protect UK citizens in the case of a no-deal Brexit, but they are generally only temporary, for example, Spain will offer transitional measures for 21 months after Brexit, Germany offers protection for nine months and France will put them in place for one year.\n\nBritish workers are integral to Airbus airliner production in Europe\n\nNo deal would immediately hit Britons whose work currently takes them to more than one EU country.\n\nThey would no longer be on a level playing field vis-a-vis EU citizens, who can easily move to another EU country and start a new job there. For Britons, post-Brexit, there will be more bureaucracy.\n\nMobility in Europe is important for many private sector workers, especially in the tech sector, such as computer game designers.\n\nSpecialists involved in pan-European research projects also need to be able to travel easily across the EU, often at short notice.\n\nDaniel Tetlow of campaign group British in Germany says \"Brits are now being discriminated against in job applications\".\n\nPost-Brexit, he said: \"I have the right only to continue working in Germany - I'm effectively landlocked.\n\n\"This has huge career implications for all UK citizens, not just those living in the EU, as is often misunderstood,\" he told the BBC. British in Germany is part of the coalition British in Europe.\n\nIt is not clear which UK professional qualifications will be recognised in the EU post-Brexit, and vice versa. Those details are yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder the withdrawal deal, British students in the EU27 can continue under the current system. But from 2021 they may face much higher tuition fees - those that non-EU students have to pay. Only Germany and Norway (which applies EU rules) offer free tuition for international students.\n\nJob search in Berlin: Conditions will change for British jobseekers\n\nNo deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply.\n\nIt could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU.\n\nNo deal would most likely delay the registration of some medicines and/or delivery of them.\n\nBritons could find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that post-Brexit, if a UK national moves to the EU, access to benefits will depend on the host country's immigration policy and the terms of any bilateral social security agreement it has with the UK.\n\nIn the EU, social security contributions are co-ordinated. So someone who has worked in more than one member state can make just one application to the relevant agency where they are living when they reach pension age. That agency notifies any other EU state where the individual has worked, and the national insurance contribution that he/she paid there becomes part of the pension.\n\nThat reciprocity disappears under a no-deal scenario. It is not clear whether any old bilateral UK deals with individual EU states on social security will be revived.\n\nThe UK tax treatment of overseas pension transfers could change post-Brexit. Transfers from the UK to non-EU countries have been subject to a 25% UK \"overseas tax charge\" since 2017. There is no guarantee that tax-free transfers will continue for UK pensioners living in the EU.\n\nWhat about the EU27 countries where most UK citizens live?\n\nOf the estimated 310,000 Britons living in Spain, about 65,000 are resident and in permanent work. About one-third of the 310,000 are pensioners.\n\nNo deal would be much less of a problem for a Briton with dual nationality. But Spain does not allow it - except for veterans of the 1930s left-wing International Brigades and Sephardi Jews who can prove a family connection with Spain. For other Britons, acquiring Spanish citizenship means surrendering a UK passport.\n\n\"Third country\" nationals in Spain have to prove annual income of at least \u20ac26,000 (\u00a323,000; $30,000) to remain legally resident - and that could be a problem for some British pensioners, post-Brexit.\n\nSpain is offering a 21-month grace period of protection for UK nationals, after which proof of residence will be needed.\n\nWhatever happens, both governments say, the Common Travel Area (CTA) will remain in force. That is a relief for Britons living in Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder the CTA, Irish and British citizens can travel and work freely in both countries. It is also recognised by the EU.\n\nThe big risk is that no deal could bring back a \"hard\" Northern Ireland border - something the withdrawal deal goes to great lengths to prevent, with the controversial backstop plan.\n\nFrench MPs have granted the government emergency powers to issue decrees in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe government says it will not impose visas on British visitors, provided the UK government also maintains visa-free travel.", "PPL": 1.95240318775177, "PPL/lower": 0.9453644144429633, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005408319079644792, "Min-5%": 8.890234339470958, "Min-10%": 7.434005547972286, "Min-20%": 5.905693005815986, "Min-30%": 4.9291234598874265, "Min-40%": 4.212067088317172, "Min-50%": 3.6473092557398106, "Min-60%": 3.171743705334803}, {"text": "tweeted her support for Ms Winfrey.\n\nCritics said Ms Trump's support for the president was incompatible with her endorsement of Ms Winfrey's Time's Up campaign.\n\nMr Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault, all of which he has denied.\n\nIvanka Trump, who describes herself as an adviser to the president on \"job creation, economic empowerment, workforce development & entrepreneurship\", has made women's issues one of her key policy areas since joining the White House.\n\nIn November, she told a Tokyo summit that sexual harassment of women should \"never be tolerated\".\n\nLike Oprah Winfrey, Ms Trump has been subject of rumours about her potential presidential ambitions.\n\nA book about the Trump administration - Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House - alleges Ms Trump and her husband Jared Kushner struck a deal that she might run for president in the future.\n\nShe's a staffer in a conservative White House who sometimes embraces more moderate policies. She's married to a man with an administrative portfolio of remarkable breadth. She embraces feminist principles but works for a president who once boasted of making unwanted sexual advances.\n\nIvanka Trump has to walk a fine line in everything she does, as the national spotlight falls squarely on her for the foregoing reasons and more.\n\nNeedless to say, her tweet about an Oprah Winfrey speech - viewed not just as an emphatic condemnation of a sexual harassment culture and a presidential trial balloon, but also as a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr Trump's presidency - turned heads.\n\nMs Trump gave a well-received address at the Republican National Convention that sounded moderate - even a bit Democratic - but her agenda has fallen flat since inauguration. Recommendations on climate change and immigration have been disregarded, and her childcare proposal has languished.\n\nMaybe that's why, if Fire and Fury's Michael Wolff is correct, Ms Trump harbours her own presidential ambitions. While she roams the halls of power now, she has left no mark on the nation.

It affects countries that account for about two thirds of global economic activity.\n\nThe fact that in the bank's view the economy is close to operating at full capacity means that there's little scope to stimulate further growth with the standard policy tools that work by boosting demand for goods and services - interest rate or tax cuts or increased government spending.\n\nIt says government should promote reforms to improve education and health services and infrastructure - such as roads ports, electricity supplies and telecommunications networks.\n\nA healthier and better educated workforce is likely to be more productive, and better infrastructure makes it easier for business to be more productive too.\n\nThe weaker growth of the capacity of the economy is an increasingly persistent theme in the analysis of official economic agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\n\nThere are some marked variations in", "PPL": 1.9283952713012695, "PPL/lower": 0.9408362385468904, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005142387390136719, "Min-5%": 9.091225273468915, "Min-10%": 7.610844546673345, "Min-20%": 6.028360317272195, "Min-30%": 4.997091220333832, "Min-40%": 4.247892745549638, "Min-50%": 3.6541805394350724, "Min-60%": 3.156332232713311}, {"text": "march.\n\nMore people turned out to witness Mr Trump and his entourage travelling along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House on Friday afternoon.\n\nThree people, including a young child, have died after a car deliberately hit pedestrians in central Melbourne, police say.\n\nAt least 29 people were injured, among them a baby who is in a critical condition after the car hit a pram.\n\nPolice have arrested the driver but say the incident was not terror-related.\n\nFootage filmed by a bystander showed a maroon car driving in circles in front of nearby Flinders Street railway station.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Football\n\nSirli Freitas took one, final phone call from her husband Cleberson Silva before he had to switch off his phone.\n\n\"There was so much background noise,\" she said. \"So much laughter and fun.\n\n\"I said, 'are you really on a plane, or in a bar?'\"\n\nJournalist Silva was on a plane that went down in the Andes on 29 November.

It was just the wind, and then an alarm.\n\n\"But no-one got desperate, there was a lot of people praying.

Its population of about 209,553 is only slightly higher than the number of people who crammed into the Maracana Stadium to watch the 1950 World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil.\n\nBut they form a tight-knit community, and a major part of that is the Chapecoense football team.\n\nClub flags and signs adorn shops and bars all over the city.\n\nThe relationship between citizens and club is one of mutual and humble respect and affection, according to 41-year-old Karina Dini.\n\n\"It was a strong bond, we were all a family,\" she said, sitting in the office of the language school she runs with her husband.\n\n\"There weren't any players who were going to parties or anything. Most of them were very committed. We could meet them in restaurants or the supermarket.\n\n\"It was amazing because players from the first division don't get that contact with people. They have big cars, they can't talk to people.\"\n\nLike Karina, whose husband's uncle died in the crash, most people here know someone who was on the plane, or someone, like Sirli Freitas, who's been affected directly.\n\n\"My eight-year-old son understands [what happened], but his sister, who's three, still asks for her dad even though she knows he's not here any more,\" she said, through tears.\n\n\"If you ask her about him, she says that he was on the plane that crashed, but but at other times she'll say, 'let's call daddy'.\"\n\nOutside the Arena Conda, there's a message to the world: \"We were looking for a word to say thanks for all the love we've received, and we found several.\"\n\nAround the stadium, the streets have been painted green and white, in the club's colours.\n\nThere has been a steady procession of press conferences, introducing some of the 22 new players. Rui Costa was brought in from Brazilian club Gremio and made director of football a week after the tragedy.\n\nCosta is adamant that Saturday's match is far more than a friendly.\n\n\"When I got here we had four players and a devastated dressing room. It was all about sadness and silence,\" he said.\n\n\"A dressing room should never be silent and here, it was. So we have accomplished our first goal - you can see a football team training here.\"\n\n\"We had a list with 90 names that we were interested in,\" he said, as he explained how he assembled the squad in less than two months.\n\n\"We were choosing based on technical characteristics, then behaviour, then salary.\n\n\"We were working almost 24 hours a day because we knew it was not about just putting them on the pitch to play together.\n\n\"We had to respect the culture of the club. That's what they hired me for.\"\n\nThe last time the people of Chapeco went to the Arena Conda, it was on a day of torrential rain, to receive the bodies of their players, directors and journalists.\n\nOn Saturday, they will return, to honour the city's fallen, and to meet their new family.\n\nThe 2004 Beslan school siege is remembered for the deaths of more than 330 people including 186 children, after a Russian school was seized by Chechen rebels. But the Belgian creators of a play, Us/Them, which relives the atrocity through the eyes of two children, say recent attacks have brought the story closer to home.\n\nThe actress Gytha Parmentier has now played Us/Them in three languages.\n\nWhen the play opened in 2014 she was speaking in her native Flemish. Later she had to translate into French the words of her character - a young girl who dies in the Beslan siege.\n\nNow she's making the one-hour piece work in English opposite Roman Van Houtven, the only other member of cast.\n\nLast year the play was a hit at the Edinburgh Festival and it has now arrived at London's National Theatre.\n\n\"Acting in English, Roman and I had to learn to move our mouths in a very different way,\" she said. \"But acting in a different language gives a new juiciness to what's in the script.\"\n\nThat script is by Carly Wijs, who also directs. She recalls the spark for the play came when her eight year-old son mentioned news coverage he'd just seen of the terror attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013.\n\n\"Godfried had been watching the report on the children's news and I was struck by the way he described it. He spoke in a way which was almost aloof - at eight you're just becoming aware of things which are on your planet but not really of your own world of home and family.\n\n\"Then Bronks, which is a fantastic production company in Brussels, asked me for a theatre idea for children.

The result is heart-breaking yet somehow heart-warming too.\n\nThe show may not strike theatregoers in advance as an obvious excursion for kids. But it's an unexpectedly charming hour in the theatre perfect for family viewing. However, the National has mainly programmed performances late in the evening which may be a bad call.\n\nWijs says her view of the events of 2004 was influenced by one TV documentary in particular.\n\n\"There was a beautiful BBC programme called Children of Beslan which was helpful: they spoke to many survivors.

It could be anywhere in this vast landscape - the Tian Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia.\n\nThere was a silence as we all realised there was no point in even trying to find it. We were two days up into the mountains and surrounded by grass.\n\nI had one last look around our camp. It was no use. I couldn't re-trace my steps, we were in the middle of nowhere. I climbed back on the horse.\n\nI walked behind the others, crying and thinking. All the memories of her passing away came back to me, bit by bit.\n\nMy naked wrist still made me feel incomplete. I wanted to go back in time to the moment I decided to bring it with me. Why hadn't I left it at home?\n\nBut maybe it was meant to be here, I thought to myself. Mum was born in Hong Kong and grew up in the UK, and this was half way.\n\nAn endless lush landscape with wild horses, snowy peaks, birds of prey and the sound of the river. Maybe it should be lost here.\n\nThat night I looked in the tents with a bit of hope left that it might be in some corner. Nothing.\n\nI crawled into my sleeping bag feeling deeply sad, and accepted it was gone for good.\n\nLater, in the city of Karakol, recovering from our trek, I visited the Russian Orthodox church.\n\nI was just about to leave, having lit a candle in remembrance of my mother, when the Russian nun took my arm and walked me to a painting of the Virgin Mary.\n\nShe kissed the glass frame of the picture and gestured that I do the same. I'm not a believer, and was not brought up religious in any way, but I followed her invitation.\n\nWhen I kissed the glass I looked up at the picture. I started crying. The picture was adorned with gold necklaces and rings.\n\nIt was feeling just how jewellery was so significant to humans that made me cry. As a student of anthropology, I have always been interested in the meaning we humans ascribe to objects.\n\nJewellery by its very nature says: Look at me, see what I can afford, observe what I was given, admire how significant I am.\n\nWhen inherited from a beloved, it also brings people into relationship, solidifying a kinship or affection, creating a sense of connectedness and of presence.\n\nThat bracelet was a physical part of my mother who is no longer physically in the world. It became part of me, and now was gone.\n\nI had already made peace with the loss of the bracelet when, some weeks after I had returned to Europe, I received a Facebook message from Elaman Asanbaev, one of the guides from the Community-Based Tourism (CBT) office in Karakol.\n\nThere was a picture attached. \"This is it or not, I don't know,\" he asked.\n\nIt was it. It was the bracelet.\n\nIt was suddenly back in existence, but what should I do? Should I get Elaman to send it? Should I leave it there? Ask him to throw it in the river?\n\nWhen I looked into secure courier services, they advised against sending precious stones or metals. I was also reluctant to trust the postal system, it being so far away.\n\nIt did occur to me that I could find someone who would be travelling there, but when I saw that flights were cheap in November I decided I would go and get it myself.\n\nLondon-Moscow-Bishkek. Then a six-hour drive from the capital Bishkek to Karakol with Azamat Asanov, the CBT manager. It was 05:00 and -11C in the capital, the roads icy with thick snow.\n\nAs we drove, I watched the country waking up. Children in their winter clothes walking to school, horses with snow on their backs, men in the traditional pointed Kyrgyz hats known as kalpaks.\n\nThe next morning we picked up Elaman. \"This is for you,\" he said as he jumped in the car.\n\nThere it was. This slim piece of gold that I have known all my life.\n\nThis part of mum, here in this car 7,000km (4,350 miles) from home in the freezing mountains of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nElaman described to Azamat where he found it. I didn't understand anything except a word that sounded like \"toilet\".\n\nAzamat translated - it was in our first campsite, a yurt camp, lying on a path towards the toilets (or, more accurately, a shed with a hole in the ground).\n\nWe laughed. Not the most romantic of places.\n\nI felt its weight and its shape. Mum held this. Putting it back on I felt complete again, and I couldn't stop looking at it.\n\nI gave Elaman a designer flask and wrapped some money around it as a reward for handing in the bracelet.\n\nThere was another day in the snow on horseback before I turned round and made the long 21-hour journey back home.\n\nWe took the horses up the Bos Uchuk valley, which means \"colourful point\". This was where we had camped on our last day of the summer trek. I could recognise the shape of the mountains and the river.\n\nOn my way back to the town I sprinkled some of mum's ashes in the river - something to exchange for the bracelet in the ground, something to put her between home and where she was born, Hong Kong.\n\nAt this point I felt that these rituals were almost too much.\n\nYet back home, looking at photographs of mum, I notice the bracelet in every picture. I think how strange it is to know that it had a story waiting of being lost and found far away in a wonderful place.\n\nIs this still the most precious thing that I own? Yes.

We should be turning their lives around and giving them support - dealing with their drug addiction, their homelessness - and getting them to make amends for the wrong they have done.\n\n\"That's really good for victims, it's good for the taxpayer and it will ease pressure on prisons.\"\n\nThe Prison Reform Trust, which has previously called for a presumption against short prison sentences, welcomed the new proposals.\n\nPeter Dawson, the charity's director, told the Telegraph: \"Ministers should be congratulated for having the political courage to start the debate.\"\n\nIn Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months.\n\nMore than half of the 86,275 offenders sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales in 2017 were handed sentences of six months or less, according to a Parliamentary response from Mr Stewart last month.\n\nThe prison population has doubled in England and Wales since the early 1990s, rising from about 40,000 to more than 80,000 in 2018, official figures show.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of prisoners released after sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year.\n\nWhat impact do short prison sentences have?

At the end of a hard match, I just tried to enjoy the moment.\n\n\"It's my first match on this court and it was very special.\"\n\nAndy Murray, Greg Rusedski, John Lloyd, Roger Taylor and Tim Henman - who was watching from the front row on Rod Laver Arena - are the only other British men to have reached Grand Slam singles semi-finals since tennis turned professional in 1968.\n\nEdmund has long looked the most likely to join that list, but few would have predicted it would happen at this year's Australian Open.\n\nRanked 49th and without an ATP final to his name, let alone a title, logic suggested there were several more steps to make before becoming a major contender.\n\nHowever, the 23-year-old Yorkshireman's huge forehand is already one of the biggest shots in the game, and marked improvements on serve and return in the off-season appear to have fast-tracked him.\n\n\"It's great,\" added Edmund. \"You don't think of those things when you play but it's something to be proud of.\n\n\"As a kid you're growing up looking at your idols and when you're here progressing in the best tournament in the world, it's amazing.\"\n\n'I prayed that last ball was out'\n\nDimitrov, 26, had won a much-anticipated match against Nick Kyrgios to reach the last eight, but his form had been patchy before then and he failed to impose himself on the powerful Edmund.\n\nThe Bulgarian dropped serve in the opening game with a loose backhand and, despite levelling at 3-3, it was a fair reflection of the play when Edmund hammered a forehand return to break again at 5-3.\n\nThe serve he had worked so hard on came to his rescue in seeing off three break-back points, and after 42 minutes the outsider was a set up.\n\nA scrappy second set slipped away from Edmund at the start as Dimitrov raced into a 3-0 lead and held on, despite an edgy seventh game that included three double faults.\n\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\n\nDimitrov's athleticism was on show with some brilliant defence early in the third set but the more experienced man was the one to crack.\n\nA loose forehand offered up two break points and a seventh double fault of the day gifted Edmund the chance to serve out the set.\n\nWhen Dimitrov hooked a wild forehand wide to drop serve midway through the fourth set there appeared no way back, but the tension took hold as Edmund handed it straight back with a poor service game.\n\nAgain there was an opening for the world number three to take charge, but once more it was Edmund who looked the calmer with victory in his sights.\n\nHe pressed for the break in game seven and then upped the pressure in game nine, opening with a hooked forehand winner followed by a backhand arrowed down the line.\n\nA first break point slipped way, but Edmund got his racquet on a good serve to float back a return on the second, and a desperate Dimitrov slammed his forehand into the net.\n\nWith Swedish coach Fredrik Rosengren a bundle of nerves in the stands, the Briton was thankful for a Dimitrov error at 15-30 and followed up with an ace.\n\nThere was one final moment of drama on match point when Edmund was made to wait - before Hawkeye eventually confirmed that Dimitrov had sent the ball long.\n\n\"He's played hard matches, especially against Nick Kyrgios, and I knew it was going to be tough,\" said Edmund.\n\n\"I had a bit of a dip and I was playing quite poor tennis at times. But I held my nerve and prayed that last ball was out.\"\n\nThat was Edmund's 12th attempt to beat a top five player, so he has shown perfect timing as well as the game to beat the world number three.\n\nFor a man making his Grand Slam quarter-final debut, on his first appearance in the Rod Laver Arena, Edmund played a hugely impressive first set. And even during the second set, which Dimitrov won, there were signs that all was not well with the Bulgarian's game.\n\nHis first serve virtually deserted him in the third set, and again, Edmund was there to take advantage.\n\nThe British player out-served Dimitrov, hit a healthy number of forehand winners, and profited handsomely when moving forward to the net.\n\nEdmund is yet to reach a final at tour level.

He likes to do things his way, and he is not one to enjoy outside interference.\n\nEcclestone's approach to business is adversarial. His problem is that Liberty have decided that they are going to run the business in a different way from now on - a more collegiate approach. He will either accept that and operate accordingly, or he won't be working there much longer.\n\nIt's hard to see how he could adapt to that way of working - or even want to. And senior sources in F1 say they believe that even if he does not go this week, they expect his departure to happen within a month.\n\nWhether he stays or not, changes will be made to the business structure. Liberty will employ two people to head up the different branches of the sport and oversee changes - commercial on the one hand; sporting and technical on the other.\n\nEx-ESPN marketing chief Sean Bratches has been given the commercial role, and former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn the other.\n\nThe history of F1 over the last decade or so has been the decline of the number of races in Europe, and the struggles of many of those remaining to meet Ecclestone's increasingly high demands for race fees.\n\nGermany does not have a race this year, and its contract ends after next year's grand prix in Hockenheim.\n\nItaly struck a new three-year deal at the 11th hour this winter. Silverstone is reluctantly toying with the idea of ending its contract after 2019 if it cannot renegotiate terms.\n\nThrough all this, Ecclestone has acted as if he does not care - if a race in Europe won't pay the fees he wants, he has usually said, he'll find one elsewhere.\n\nThere's usually a controversial regime wanting to stump up a wad of cash to host an F1 race.\n\nLiberty want to end this. They see the historic European races - Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, for example - as a key aspect of F1 and one they have to nurture and cherish.\n\nThey recognise that Europe is F1's core market, where most of its TV audience is, and they want the races there to be the centrepiece of the 'new F1', one that has a visible link to a heritage it treasures.\n\nEcclestone's ethos has been to take F1 to any country that wants it and has a large enough chequebook to fund it.\n\nHis eye has been on the deal itself - and not on its wider consequences on F1.\n\nThis is how F1 has ended up with races in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, countries with controversial records on human rights, and how Ecclestone has found himself for the last three years sitting next to Vladimir Putin at the Russian Grand Prix.\n\nAll three countries pay astronomical fees for their races - Russia $50m year; Azerbaijan a reputed $75m, for example.\n\nLiberty wants to take a different approach. For them, deals based solely on the bottom line and nothing else are not necessarily the right deals.\n\nThey want to expand F1 - but they want new races to be held in the right places and for the right reasons. And they are prepared to invest to make it happen.\n\nThis is a massive shift from Ecclestone's approach.\n\nThe idea of spending money now to earn more later has largely been anathema to Ecclestone.\n\nSome argue it has been one of the reasons why he struggled for so long to establish a race in the USA until Austin, Texas, came along.\n\nLiberty are open about wanting races in New York and Los Angeles - or near enough to be easily identified as such - and are prepared to put down their own money to make it happen.\n\nThey have also talked about more races in Latin America and Asia.\n\nCarey has been clear that he sees the opportunity to expand the business \"in all areas\", but the one where there is most room for improvement is in exploiting the internet.\n\nEcclestone has made no secret of the fact that he does not really get social media, nor see any opportunity to monetise it.\n\nYounger people in F1 have grown frustrated with this, and realise that there are any number of things that could be done.\n\nBut, aware that rare has been the person who has crossed Ecclestone without consequence, they have in recent years kept their counsel and waited for a change to happen.\n\nLiberty are clear that this is an area where they see vast potential, and it's quite conceivable that, over time, the entire business model of F1 will change as a result.\n\nRight now, F1 is sold as a whole package to one or sometimes two TV stations in a country. But insiders see the opportunity to sell it piecemeal through the internet, with varying degrees of access for varying amounts of money.\n\nPromotionally, too, there is a lot of room to make gains.\n\nEcclestone is called the \"promoter\". But many argue that's a misnomer - in that he doesn't really do any promoting at all.\n\nArrive in any city or country hosting a grand prix and it is often hard to tell there is an event going on.\n\nMany races are not sold out - but how are people who might have a passing interest in going expected to know when that opportunity exists without them being advertised effectively?\n\nLiberty are talking about having \"20 Super Bowls\". By which they don't mean an Americanisation of the event - but of making a bigger deal of the event itself wherever it is being held.\n\nBuild it up in the week before the race with various promotional activities and so on.\n\nMany F1 insiders recognise that in recent years the sport has lost its way a little.\n\nIt remains the arena where the best drivers in the world race in the fastest cars, but its edginess has been dulled.\n\nThe risk and challenge are still there - but less apparent.\n\nLiberty are keen to get this back.\n\nThis year's new rules - decided upon long before Liberty was involved - are a first step in that direction, with wider, more dramatic-looking cars expected to lap up to five seconds faster and provide a more extreme physical challenge for the drivers.\n\nBut the jury is still out as to whether this will work.\n\nNo-one doubts the cars will be dramatically faster. The question is whether Pirelli has managed to build the more durable tyres that have been demanded to go with them.\n\nF1 bosses have drawn up a set of requirements for Pirelli that they expect to lead to tyres on which drivers can push flat out most of the time - which has simply not been possible since 2011 because the tyres have been too fragile.\n\nIf this has not happened, it will turn out to have been rather pointless to make faster cars because the drivers will not be able to use all their potential.\n\nLiberty - having taken over the contract Ecclestone struck with Pirelli - have been made aware of these issues and will be watching closely.\n\nAnother area which may come under scrutiny is driver head protection.\n\nGoverning body the FIA has been working hard on the 'halo' device which protects drivers from heavy flying debris.

It is thought she was born about three days earlier.\n\nThe two people in the footage walked up and down nearby Ash Road 10 times in an hour on 15 May, police said.\n\nA post-mortem examination revealed the child died from \"deliberately inflicted\" head injuries, police said.\n\nShe suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head, with other minor injuries to her body, and died within six hours of being born.\n\nIt is thought the birth took place under this tree in Manor Park\n\nThe body of the baby was discovered in Manor Park, Aldershot, in May\n\nDet Ch Insp Dave Storey, of Hampshire Constabulary, said analysis by the National History Museum found the birth would most likely have happened under a tree in the park between 18:00 BST on 15 May and 08:00 the following day.\n\nHe added a DNA profile taken from the baby, whose body was discovered at the edge of the park by a council worker, showed that both she and her mother, and probably the child's father, were of east Asian ethnicity.\n\n\"This remains a particularly sad case in which, despite extensive investigation, we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby Baby M, nor her mother,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a baby who is unnamed and, at this stage, is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M.\"\n\nHe added the force was still trying to identify the mother and offer support \"because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards\".\n\nFlowers were left at the park gates following the discovery of the baby's body\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThere have been 4,000 suspected cases of diphtheria in the overcrowded refugee camps and at least 31 deaths.\n\nMedics in the camps are seeing 100 new cases every day.\n\nAnt McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong were together for 23 years\n\nAnt McPartlin has confirmed he is divorcing Lisa Armstrong after 11 years of marriage.\n\nThe presenter, who co-hosts several ITV shows with Declan Donnelly, released a statement on Sunday, asking for privacy \"for both himself, Lisa and their immediate families\".\n\nThe couple met in 1994 when they were performing as singers on the Smash Hits tour in Newcastle.\n\nThey were together for 23 years and married in 2007.\n\nThe Sun is also reporting that Armstrong has hired lawyers Harbottle and Lewis to negotiate a \u00a331m divorce settlement.

Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts to BBC Newsnight\n\nThe agreement covers Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh following attacks by a Rohingya militant group on police posts in October 2016 and August 2017.\n\nThose attacks triggered a military crackdown that led to widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture of Rohingya.\n\nThe agreement does not cover Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh prior to October 2016, under previous crackdowns and bouts of communal violence.\n\nWhen the initial repatriation deal was signed in November, Amnesty International said it doubted there could be safe or dignified returns \"while a system of apartheid remains\" and added that it \"hoped those who do not want to go home are not forced to do so\".\n\nThe Rohingya are a stateless minority in Myanmar, also known as Burma.\n\nThe crisis has been described as ethnic cleansing by the UN and the US.\n\nDespite widespread accusations of human rights violations, Myanmar has consistently denied persecuting its Rohingya minority.\n\nThe UK's inflation rate has fallen for the first time since June, mainly because of the impact of air fares.\n\nThe inflation rate dipped to 3% in December, down from November's rate of 3.1% - a six-year high.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that while air fares rose last month, it had a smaller impact than at the same point in 2016.\n\nIt added that a drop in the price of toys and games also contributed to December's fall.\n\nThe ONS said it was too early to say whether this was the start of a longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation.\n\nThe Bank of England has said it thinks inflation peaked at the end of 2017 and will fall back to its target of 2% this year.\n\nThe rate had been rising over the past year, partly due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote which has pushed up the cost of imported goods.\n\nIn November, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%.\n\nBut Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The continued weakness of underlying price pressures means that the MPC has little need to rush the next rate hike.\"\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O'Carroll agreed there was no need for another quick rise in interest rates, but said: \"What matters most for the long-term health of the UK economy is improving its productivity performance.\n\n\"If we can do that then the Bank of England may be able to keep rates low for a lot longer. But on recent experience, improving productivity is much easier said than done.\"\n\nInflation in the year to December was 3%, rather than the previous 3.1%, naturally generating predictions that it has now peaked.\n\nOne of the biggest factors driving inflation has been the inflated price of imports following the Brexit vote feeding through to the shops.\n\nYes, the vote and the devaluation of the pound following it was more than a year-and-a-half ago. But because many retailers buy their stock a year or two ahead, they have only felt the impact of costlier imports in the last few months.\n\nFor the same reason the recent rally in sterling, which if it lasts should bring down the cost of imports, isn't yet benefiting consumers. In fact, taking goods prices separately from services, inflation at 3.4% is higher than it's been for more than five years.\n\nEven if inflation more broadly has peaked, the Bank of England has to bring it down over the next two to three years closer to its 2% target.\n\nOn that basis trading in the City currently forecasts the next interest rate rise will take place in August.\n\nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the drop in inflation was not enough to \"significantly ease the pressure on UK household spending\" because wages were still rising by less than the rate of inflation.\n\nHowever, he said that if that situation changed then \"a sustained trend of falling inflation and better wage growth could spell happier times for the UK consumer, and the UK economy\".\n\nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"We suspect that relatively lacklustre economic growth will continue to limit domestic price pressures.\n\n\"Earnings growth seems likely to pick up only gradually as some firms remain keen to limit their total costs in a challenging and uncertain environment.\n\n\"Fragile consumer confidence may also deter some workers from pushing hard for increased pay rises, despite recent higher inflation and a tight labour market.\"\n\nThe Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, rose to 4.1% last month from 3.9% in November.\n\nThe ONS's preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner-occupiers' housing costs, fell to 2.7% in December, down from 2.8% the month before.\n\nAnti-abortion protesters have been accused of \"harassing\" women attending Marie Stopes abortion clinic in Ealing, London.\n\nNow the local council is considering legal action.\n\nWatch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\n\nFast food giant McDonald's has said all its packaging worldwide will come from sustainable sources by 2025.\n\nThe restaurant chain will aim to get all items like bags, straws, wrappers and cups from recycled or renewable materials, up from half currently.\n\nMcDonald's also wants 100% of its restaurants to recycle packaging by then, compared with only 10% now.\n\nIt comes as UK supermarket Iceland has promised to drastically reduce its plastic packaging by the end of 2023.\n\nBoth companies said there was an overwhelming demand from customers to make packaging more environmentally friendly.\n\nFrancesca DeBiase, McDonald's chief supply chain and sustainability officer, said it was customers' number one request \"to use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use\".\n\nIn the UK, sites no longer use foam packaging and more than 1,000 restaurants have recycling bins for plastics and paper cups.\n\nHowever, the world's biggest restaurant chain, which has 37,000 sites worldwide, said some restaurants might struggle to recycle packaging by 2025.\n\nThat is because infrastructure, regulations and customer behaviour vary around the world, but McDonald's \"plans to be part of the solution\".\n\nFriends of the Earth welcomed the news, but said \"speedier action in some countries, such as the UK is surely possible\".\n\nMcDonald's is already aiming for all its paper and card packaging, such as burger boxes or paper bags, to come from recycled or certified sources where no deforestation occurs by 2020.\n\nIn the UK, retailers have faced outcries over the packaging of coconuts and cauliflower \"steaks\", and shoppers have reacted to vivid images of plastic pollution in Sir David Attenborough's Blue Planet programme.\n\nIceland is aiming to remove plastic from the packaging of more than 1,000 own-brand products within the next five years wherever feasible.\n\nNew ranges will be packaged using a paper-based tray, rather than plastic.\n\nNigel Broad", "PPL": 1.7777057886123657, "PPL/lower": 0.9140924058281089, "PPL/zlib": 0.0004913504114462039, "Min-5%": 8.8097331570644, "Min-10%": 7.31296482740664, "Min-20%": 5.72581390996434, "Min-30%": 4.7260296993224555, "Min-40%": 3.994356117067827, "Min-50%": 3.4089652434472115, "Min-60%": 2.92670660339757}, {"text": "a bright spotlight at a police station in Central London, Van Haarlem protested his innocence. Then, 10 days later, things turned really strange: a visitor arrived claiming to be the prisoner's mother. Johanna van Haarlem was a Dutch woman in her early sixties, who peered at detectives from behind huge glasses. Her son was no spy, she insisted, but an honest Dutchman - the child she had abandoned in 1944 and rediscovered 11 years earlier. The baffled detectives allowed her to visit their suspect.\n\n\"Tell me, I'm hearing all these strange stories,\" she said. \"You're not really a spy, are you?\"\n\n\"We have a saying that where you see the smoke, there will be a fire,\" Van Haarlem told her. \"But this time it is not true. Too much of the smoke and no fire. I did absolutely nothing that could harm England.\"\n\nJohanna sighed with relief. \"But why? Why all of this, then?\" she said.\n\n\"Don't ask me. Ask them.\"\n\nAnd then he noticed a tiny red spot on her forearm. The DNA blood test results from the Home Office laboratory indicated, with near certainty, that they were not related. Johanna van Haarlem broke down in tears as her world collapsed.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem was 52 on her first visit to London to meet Erwin\n\nOn 6 February 1989, at London's Old Bailey, prosecutor Roy Amlot told a jury that the defendant had stolen her son's identity.\n\n\"You may think that if he knew all along, it was a cruel thing to do to her,\" he said.\n\nThe trial captivated the press. The Daily Express described Van Haarlem as \"an old-fashioned... slick-suited spy who inhabited a world of dead letterboxes and secret codes\". Exotic beauties came forward to kiss-and-tell about their love affairs with the spy. But the most wounded victim stood in the witness box, the tragic Dutchwoman, Johanna van Haarlem.\n\nOn 4 March 1989, at 11:45, the judge sentenced Erwin van Haarlem to 10 years in prison for espionage. \"He is probably the first person to be tried at the Old Bailey under an alias,\" one senior Scotland Yard officer told a reporter. The \"spy with no name\", as the newspapermen called him, would take his secrets with him to his cell.\n\nAfter months of negotiation and false starts, I met Erwin van Haarlem on a spring day in Prague, in 2016. Although he had lived quietly as a free man for the past 23 years, spies famously do not talk. Introduced to me by the Czech crime journalist, Jaroslav Kmenta, Van Haarlem arrived at a restaurant near the city's Old Town Square, wearing a smart blue blazer. After carefully checking my identification he began, in accented English, to tell me his story.\n\nIt began on 23 August 1944, when he was born Vaclav Jelinek in Modrany, a small village near Prague. His father had owned a small bakery there, selling biscuits and ice creams, until the Communists took power. Young Jelinek enlisted in mandatory military service, and, as the Cold War intensified, he graduated to a position in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. He dreamed of military valour and excitement. But what he got was mind-numbing shifts and grunt work.\n\nOne day his superiors caught him studying German vocabulary instead of guarding a checkpoint in the snow. They marched him to an upstairs office where he expected disciplinary action. Instead he was introduced to two members of Statni bezpecnost - the Czechoslovak secret State police. The StB was a shadowy spy agency that reported directly to the Soviets.\n\nThe StB agents had studied his file and learned that Jelinek was defiant, a womaniser, highly intelligent, prone to violence, patriotic, and a risk-taker. In other words, perfect spy material. After careful training, they decided he was ready to begin an undercover mission abroad, spying on the West.\n\nThe StB searched through its files of missing persons and assigned Jelinek a false identity - that of a Dutch boy, abandoned at an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague, at the end of World War Two. The child had been born just one day before Jelinek.\n\n\"Your new name,\" they told him, \"is Erwin van Haarlem.\"\n\nHe applied for a Dutch passport, and arrived in London by train in June 1975. To the boy from Prague, it was an alien city swarming with traffic, fashion, and danger. He took a job at the 24th-floor Roof restaurant at the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, Mayfair, hoping to spy on the Royals down the road at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt night, he exchanged coded messages with his home country via radio. One of his first ideas was to try planting listening devices in the Queen's furniture, he recalls, though he and his bosses realised it was technically unrealistic.\n\nHis secret career was running smoothly until late 1977, when he received a disturbing message from Prague: \"YOUR MOTHER IS TRYING TO FIND YOU IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA WITH THE HELP OF THE RED CROSS. SHOULD THE RED CROSS FIND YOU, A MEETING IS TO BE AGREED WITH.\"\n\nHe read the message over and over again. In October of that year, Van Haarlem received a handwritten letter from Johanna van Haarlem. The Dutch embassy had given her his address, she wrote. She was thrilled to find him. As he had been ordered, the spy politely replied in November, enclosing some photographs. He began the letter: \"Dear mother\". When he sent a cordial invitation to visit him in London, she left immediately.\n\nJohanna woke up early on 1 January 1978, in a West London hotel. Her stomach was knotted with nerves. She stepped on to the street littered with the detritus of New Year's Eve. It was her plan to arrive early and check out her son's address. But on the opposite side of the street a familiar-looking young man walked past.\n\n\"Are you Mrs van Haarlem?\" the spy said, stopping in his tracks.\n\n\"Hello Mother, it's your son.\"\n\nThey embraced in the middle of the street. Johanna stepped back to look at him. Tears were rolling down her face.\n\n\"Your father did not have such dark hair,\" said Johanna, studying him. Then she commented that he was shorter than his father.\n\nInside his apartment a champagne cork popped as Johanna breathlessly told him her life story. The bottle had frozen in the refrigerator but Van Haarlem managed to pour a couple of glasses.\n\nShe had grown up in The Hague, in Holland, and was an 18-year-old virgin when she met his father on a train, in November 1943. Gregor Kulig was a Nazi. He was blue-eyed, 23, and Polish. Handsome. At a party four weeks later, she said, he raped her.\n\nAnd when her father discovered she was pregnant, he exploded. \"You are a sinner!\" he told her. He ordered her to take the child to a distant town and give him away.\n\nFull of sadness and desperation, in autumn 1944 Johanna travelled to Czechoslovakia by train. After a brief effort to survive there as a single mother, she walked into an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague. Sobbing, she kissed baby Erwin goodbye, and returned to Holland alone.\n\nHer father - a Jew who had joined the National Socialist Movement to protect his family - destroyed the adoption papers and banned her from ever speaking about her son.\n\nOver the years, dozens of letters arrived from the orphanage asking Johanna to take back her child. They went unanswered. But every year on his birthday, Johanna silently remembered her missing son, his name she could not even speak: Erwin van Haarlem.\n\nNow she had found him. As they finished their champagne, he took her hand in his.\n\n\"You have to believe it,\" he told her. \"I am your son.\"\n\nShortly after their emotional \"reunion\", Johanna invited Erwin to meet the Van Haar", "PPL": 2.180964231491089, "PPL/lower": 0.9866647064876389, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005944301530365464, "Min-5%": 9.54922105284298, "Min-10%": 8.252782524800768, "Min-20%": 6.638893796645633, "Min-30%": 5.567272858045, "Min-40%": 4.758447702910323, "Min-50%": 4.096475865018216, "Min-60%": 3.5494321224549696}, {"text": "This Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It's so great.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 52 will be a rematch of the 39th staging of the annual finale to the NFL season, when quarterback Brady threw two touchdown passes and the Patriots won 24-21 for their third title in four seasons.\n\nThey could complete the same run of success in two weeks when they play in a record 10th Super Bowl.\n\nThe Eagles, whose other Super Bowl appearance in 1981 also ended in defeat, last won an NFL title in 1960 before the Super Bowl era began.\n\nBrady, who needed stitches for an injury to his right hand suffered in practice on Wednesday, completed 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards, 138 of them in the fourth quarter, as the Patriots clinched the AFC Championship.\n\n\"We said whatever it takes,\" said the 40-year-old. \"That was a great second half. I'm just so proud of our team. Amazing.\"\n\nThe Patriots trailed by 10 points in the final quarter but Brady's touchdown pass to Danny Amendola reduced the deficit to 20-17.\n\nAmendola then pulled off an acrobatic catch to secure the decisive touchdown.\n\n\"We've got a lot of guys that fight and never give up, that know how to play situational football,\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. \"I'm really proud of these guys.\"\n\nFoles, who took over as Philadelphia's quarterback last month after an injury to Carson Wentz, completed 26 of 33 passes for a total of 352 yards as the Eagles scored 38 unanswered points.\n\n\"This moment, it's unbelievable. It's humbling,\" he said.\n\n\"The team was amazing. I'm a little speechless. It's amazing soaking this all in. We all believe in each other. Everyone was against us. We came in here and came out with an amazing victory.\"\n\nFoles proved he can deliver in big games after some critics wrote off the Eagles's chances of winning the NFC title following Wentz's injury.\n\n\"I'm so happy for Nick,\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"For everything he has been through and battled he has stayed true and stayed the course.

But they equally realise their constitutional duty to accept the leadership of the politicians, of the elected government.\"\n\nThe former chancellor, who was one of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's strongest supporters until they fell out in 1989, thought the 1980s provided a useful parallel.\n\nHe said: \"Brexit is a most radical change of direction for this country. The idea that any bureaucrat could be in favour of radical change is a nonsense. Bureaucrats by their very nature loathe radical change of any kind.\n\n\"I was... a member of the Thatcher government. We came in and introduced radical change in economic policy. All the officials were aghast. They thought it would be a disaster. But at that time we had a strong cabinet led by an outstanding prime minister and they accepted the political leadership as is their constitutional duty.\n\n\"So we made this radical change and it worked out very well. It is really the job of the government, the cabinet and above all the prime minister to force this through.\"\n\nSir Jeremy rallied to the defence of the civil service. In a statement issued to Newsnight, the cabinet secretary said:\n\n\"The civil service has always prided itself on supporting the elected government of the day in carrying out its mandate. In this case the mandate has come from the British people, has been endorsed overwhelmingly by Parliament and is the driving mission of the current government.\n\nSir Jeremy Heywood said the civil service prided itself on supporting the mandate of the government of the day\n\n\"The civil service is putting enormous effort and many of its very best people into making a success of the project. It is being tested on a daily basis and I am very proud of what we have - so far - delivered. Morale is at record-levels, proving once again that the civil service is at is very best when under pressure.\"\n\nThe criticisms by Lord Lawson, who stressed that he was speaking about the civil service in general because he does not know Mr Robbins, reflect the private views of some cabinet ministers.\n\nOne senior minister said he believes that Mr Robbins regards Brexit as a crisis to be managed rather than an opportunity to be seized.\n\nSpeaking anonymously, the minister told Newsnight:", "PPL": 1.792650580406189, "PPL/lower": 0.9234387700831453, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005200610909214357, "Min-5%": 9.48760020499136, "Min-10%": 7.905477764559727, "Min-20%": 6.110843892202401, "Min-30%": 4.96498661670312, "Min-40%": 4.126275525990792, "Min-50%": 3.4828050015958523, "Min-60%": 2.965903607479233}, {"text": "how many steps we've taken really motivate us to do more exercise and eat more healthily?\n\nIn short, do they really work?\n\n\"They've made us all aware of how we treat our bodies, and they have even helped people diagnose things like diabetes and obesity,\" says Collette Johnson, head of marketing at design technology consultancy Plextek.\n\n\"But I feel they could go further.\"\n\nLast year the University of Pittsburgh concluded that fitness trackers were \"ineffective at sustaining weight loss\".\n\nThe two-year study, conducted by the university's School of Education Department of Health and Physical Activity, involved 500 overweight volunteers. All were asked to diet and engage in more exercise, but only half were given a fitness tracker to help them.\n\nDo fitness trackers make us more or less motivated?\n\nThe study found that the group wearing trackers lost 8lb (3.6kg), but the ones who didn't lost 13lb (5.9kg).\n\n\"Trackers are a reliable measurement of our activity, but we can't rely on them completely,\" says Andrew Lane, professor of sport psychology at the University of Wolverhampton.\n\n\"We can't expect just to buy one and that's it - some of the responsibility sits with us too. We still have to get off that sofa and complete those 10,000 steps a day.\"\n\nProf Lane believes that, if used inappropriately, they may even start to have a negative psychological effect.\n\n\"What if we start consistently not reaching goals set for us by them? Ultimately it would lead to us feeling demotivated - the opposite effect they are supposed to have.\"\n\nSuch concerns haven't stopped the market from booming - yet.\n\nLeading wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit reported 2015 revenues of \u00a31.3bn, while researcher CSS Insight forecasts that the market will be worth \u00a316bn by 2020.\n\nAnd the fact that smartwatch sales declined sharply last year, according to market analysts IDC, has led many makers to reposition them primarily as fitness-tracking devices - another indication of where the business potential lies.\n\nBut is the problem with them that they are neither accurate nor sophisticated enough yet?\n\n\"As well as providing data for us, companies need to provide coaching with this data. They need to take responsibility for the results they're providing us,\" says Prof Lane.\n\nPlextek's Collette Johnson thinks trackers need to give us more tailored advice\n\nAnd Plextek's Ms Johnson thinks they need to understand more about the individual user.\n\n\"They need to recognise whether Sharon from Uxbridge really should be doing two hours of fitness a week, how that's going to impact upon her body, her joints, whether she's at risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\"Fitness trackers can be too generic, personalising them will motivate us more,\" she tells the BBC.\n\nApps, like the Slimming World app, may be better for achieving sustained weight loss, she argues, because they allow you to track your weight loss progress and give you incentives after it has recorded your exercise.\n\n\"There is no doubt the industry is booming, but for it to really see results it needs not only to give us results, but to make them as personalised and as accurate as possible.\"\n\nSo what tech innovations are making fitness tracking more effective?\n\nGenetics and nutrition firm DNAFit advises on how we should be training and what we should be eating after testing our genes and applying its algorithm to the analysis.\n\nYou take a saliva swab and send it off to the company's lab. After 10 days a report tells you which exercises your body will respond to best and which foods you should be eating. The company says its technology platform has been peer reviewed and clinically tested.\n\nAndrew Steele, DNAFit's head of product, shows how to take a saliva swab for DNA testing\n\nOther companies such as FitnessGenes, Genetrainer and AnabolicGenes adopt similar approaches.\n\nJo Rooney, 35, a deputy headteacher, used the test to try to cure her stomach problems.\n\n\"My results came back quite quickly and told me that I was actually lactose intolerant and had a high sensitivity to gluten.\n\n\"This did mean quite a radical change to my diet, and a lot more forward planning, but within a week I felt a lot less bloated, lost weight and I'd stopped having stomach problems.\"\n\nBody scanners and tech built into sports clothes are also giving us more detailed results.\n\nFor example, Fit3D uses scanners to assess the whole body to calculate body fat percentage, assess posture and give body shape scoring.\n\nWhile last year, OMsignal launched OMbra, a smart sports bra that tracks heart rate, breathing and distance between steps, and shares this data with a smartphone app.\n\nThe OMbra is a wearable fitness tracker that's really wearable\n\nProf Lane believes that we're also going to start seeing biometric devices integrated not just into clothes and wearable devices, but directly on to our bodies as well.\n\nFor example, US tech firm Chaotic Moon Studios - now called Fjord - has created a prototype tech tattoo - a skin-mounted monitor that connects to your smartphone to monitor heart rate, blood pressure and even track movement via GPS.\n\nNow we just need an injection of willpower.\n\nWhat seemed to be a certainty is now not so sure.\n\nAll of the noises, particularly from the man himself, pointed towards Alastair Cook ending his 59-Test reign as England captain.\n\nBut Thursday's news that Cook will be given as much time as he needs to decide on his future hints at a greater possibility he will remain in charge.\n\nWhat might persuade him to stay? What might more Cook mean for the England side? And what happens if it goes wrong?\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThrough a combination of Cook's words and demeanour on a thoroughly miserable winter tour of India.\n\nEven before the start he admitted he was looking forward to not being captain, going on say he had \"questions\" over his future and he needed time to think about his position.\n\nThat Cook may be tired of the rigours of captaincy is no surprise, he is over four years into a job that no-one has managed to do for more than five since 1961.\n\nAnd, during a gruelling schedule of seven back-to-back Tests in Bangladesh and India, he cut an increasingly gloomy figure, especially after England lost the final two matches by an innings despite posting first-innings totals in excess of 400.\n\n\"When you have presided over something so cataclysmic in sporting terms as that, then it is only natural that Cook may be thinking differently about his future as captain,\" said BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew after England lost the fifth Test in Chennai.\n\nAll of this suggested Cook would call time on his tenure in his regular post-series review with England director of cricket Andrew Strauss, his good friend and former opening partner.\n\nThat meeting takes place on Friday, but we now know Cook's future will not be decided.\n\nTime may just heal all wounds.\n\nCook has been close to quitting before, only to be talked out of jumping ship by his wife Alice. It could be that a Christmas at home and discussions with his closest confidant have pushed the 32-year-old in the direction of staying.\n\n\"They really are a team,\" said Agnew of Cook and his wife. \"The time he is taking means that Cook is making the right decision for him. He will be incredibly comfortable with what lies ahead.\"\n\nThe opener, England's record Test runscorer, is approaching this decision very much in the way he constructs an innings. Patiently, meticulously, playing a shot only when absolutely certain.\n\nThere was no throwing in the towel after the chaotic fifth Test loss or rushing into a meeting with Strauss at the earliest opportunity. Even now he has indicated he would like more time.\n\nAll of that suits the England management, who feel there is no rush for an answer on the captaincy with the next Test not until July.\n\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss said last month he would be \"disappointed\" if Cook did not remain as skipper.\n\nIt may be the longer he waits to give an answer, the more likely Cook is to stay on.\n\nWhy might he stay?\n\nCook has been on the brink before, most notably the summer of 2014", "PPL": 2.1612560749053955, "PPL/lower": 0.9638380188730101, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005615110612900482, "Min-5%": 9.088410849664726, "Min-10%": 7.890003199670829, "Min-20%": 6.371665328522474, "Min-30%": 5.380739020602323, "Min-40%": 4.632672845880093, "Min-50%": 4.021335032911478, "Min-60%": 3.503744249089533}, {"text": "those things.\"\n\nMr Bercow rejected calls to publish the advice he had received from his clerks.\n\nIn making his ruling, he argued that if Parliament was always bound by precedent \"nothing would change and things do change\".\n\nHe was \"not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons\", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could.\n\nThe BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said it was a \"massive ruling\", made reportedly against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler.\n\nHe said it drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit.\n\nSince being elected as Speaker in 2009, he has angered many Tory MPs for his handling of business and treatment of MPs, but he also has many admirers, particularly on the Labour benches, who believe he has transformed the way Parliament holds the executive to account.\n\nHe sat as Conservative MP for Buckingham from 1997 but, in line with tradition, quit the party and sits as an independent since becoming Speaker.

For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold\n\nMs Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I'm making a number of changes to our welfare system to make sure that it delivers on the intent which is to be a safety net and also to be a compassionate and fair system helping people into work.\"\n\nAhead of a speech on Friday announcing the changes, she also signalled a benefit freeze introduced in 2016 might not be renewed when it comes to an end next year.\n\n\"It was the right policy at the time... I look forward to it coming off,\" she told Sky News.\n\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment:\n\nIt was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and is being introduced in stages across the UK.\n\nConfirming she would delay asking MPs to authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system, she told Today: \"We have listened to people. We know they want more individual assistance either with getting payments more regularly or having payments made direct to landlords.\"\n\n\"These elements, which could help universal credit work more helpfully for individuals receiving it, are what I'm going to be changing.\"\n\nShe also said she wanted to ensure that the main carer in a household would be the primary recipient of universal credit.\n\nOn the two-child limit, she will say in her speech later that it was \"not right\" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced.\n\n\"These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,\" she will say.\n\nThe \"child element\" of universal credit varies, but is worth at least \u00a3231.67 a child per month.\n\nMs Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to \"learn from errors\" and \"adjust\" the system after taking expert guidance.\n\nHer predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money.\n\nThe system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMs Rudd will defend the introduction of the benefit by saying: \"Universal credit is working for the vast majority of people.\n\n\"As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you.\n\n\"But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it.\"\n\nShadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the government should abandon the two-child limit in its entirety.\n\n\"Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the roll out now,\" she said.\n\nFormer Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: \"I strongly welcome the secretary of state's decision not to press ahead with what could have been the cruellest benefit cut in history.\n\n\"At the eleventh hour, she has prevented thousands of children from being plunged into poverty by an unjustifiable retrospective policy.\"\n\nThis speech is billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do.\n\nThe last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit.\n\nBut this speech demonstrates that Amber Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system.\n\nShe will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement.\n\nIrresistible Manchester City scored nine goals as they thrashed Burton Albion with an incredible display of attacking football in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at Etihad Stadium.\n\nGabriel Jesus scored four, with Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and Riyad Mahrez also scoring against Nigel Clough's beleaguered League One side.\n\nHeaders from De Bruyne and Jesus made it 2-0, the Brazilian tapped in a third and Zinchenko's curler put City four up.\n\nJesus added two more headers, with Foden, Walker and Mahrez scoring further goals.\n\nThis was the first time in more than 31 years that City had scored more than eight goals in a single match - they beat Huddersfield Town 10-1 in a second-tier league encounter in November 1987.\n\nIt means City have scored 16 goals in four days after thrashing Rotherham United 7-0 in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday.\n\nThe second leg, merely a formality, takes place at the Pirelli Stadium on Wednesday, 23 January, with the final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, 24 February.\n\nCity, the Carabao Cup holders, are set to meet either Tottenham or Chelsea in the final, with Spurs leading 1-0 after Harry Kane's penalty gave them a first-leg victory at Wembley on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Hours stuck on the M6 to witness a 9-0 loss... if they even got there - Burton fans' night to forget\n\u2022 None 'Of course we're in the final' - Guardiola on 9-0 first-leg win\n\u2022 None Relive Manchester City's win over Burton Albion as it happened\n\nCity kill the tie off", "PPL": 1.9368876218795776, "PPL/lower": 0.9103647321690211, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005169168993540373, "Min-5%": 9.352670047797409, "Min-10%": 7.823544850536421, "Min-20%": 6.163431659595891, "Min-30%": 5.104518320739075, "Min-40%": 4.327756997425574, "Min-50%": 3.7001232360348557, "Min-60%": 3.1828302354688365}, {"text": "ions at illegal taps before.\n\nThe government is attempting to prevent fuel theft but some argue the strategy has led to fuel shortages.\n\nCamp beds are set up in a lounge in Crystal Palace's ground when temperatures drop below freezing\n\nA Premier League club has offered part of its stadium as an emergency shelter for rough sleepers.\n\nCrystal Palace FC will turn part of Selhurst Park in south London into a space where up to 10 homeless people can sleep when temperatures are forecast to drop below freezing.\n\nThey will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities, said Croydon Council, who helped set it up.\n\nEight people used the emergency shelter on Thursday night.\n\nThey slept on camp beds which were set up in a lounge inside the club's ground.\n\nThe new emergency shelter at Selhurst Park can house up to 10 homeless people\n\nCrystal Palace chief executive Phil Alexander said the club wanted to \"be a force in the community\".\n\n\"We are delighted to be collaborating with Croydon Council and their partner agencies to ensure that rough sleepers can find an emergency shelter in the event of severe winter weather,\" he added.\n\nWhen Selhurst Park is unavailable due to home matches, the council said it would continue to refer rough sleepers to other emergency shelters in Croydon and in central London.\n\nThe rough sleepers will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities\n\nCouncillor Alison Butler said Crystal Palace was \"setting a standard for other clubs to follow\".\n\n\"Freezing temperatures are a particular safety risk for rough sleepers and this is a wonderful gesture by Crystal Palace for helping us reduce that risk.\"\n\nLast year, the council approved plans to increase Selhurst Park's capacity from 25,456 to more than 34,000.\n\nPalace, who are 14th in the table, travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in the Premier League later.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBetting is a mug's game.

Will Olivia Colman win at this year's Oscars? Does life exist on another planet?\n\nAnd if you're in the mood for a long night, what's next for Brexit? There's plenty to wonder about there. Britain's future is currently about as predictable as a game of blindfolded darts played by left-handed toddlers using their right arms to throw.\n\nNobody has a clue as to what is going to happen. Politicians, commentators and pub bores all have a view they will happily share, but nobody actually knows. Which makes the subject fertile ground for novelists, whose stock-in-trade it is to let their imaginations run wild and hypothesise.\n\nEnter John Lanchester, a first-class essayist and now five-time novelist who has written The Wall, a dystopian tale set in a Britain of the near-ish future. Suffice it to say, things have not gone well.\n\nClimate change (\"the Change\") has done for the country's coastline, which is now beachless and miserable and home to the eponymous Wall: a 10,000km-long, 3m-wide concrete barricade snaking around Britain's perimeter, patrolled by Defenders whose job is to keep out the Others - desperate, homeless migrants from flooded foreign parts.\n\nIf an Other succeeds in breaching the heavily guarded Wall, then the Defender considered most culpable is put out to sea in a dinghy never to be seen or heard of again. It's a bit harsh, but rules are rules.\n\nThe home guard of Defenders is made up of young men and women who are conscripted through a new National Service. It's a minimum two-year posting of joyless 12-hour shifts with statutory leave taken at home with parents to whom they do not speak because \"the olds\" are to blame for not only wrecking the planet, but also thoughtlessly bringing kids into a world without beaches.\n\nThe book has many of the standard tropes of a dystopian novel. There is a totalitarian state operating in a bleak post-industrial landscape caused by a climatic catastrophe, creating the justification for a faceless bureaucracy to suppress and control a cowed population.\n\nOur protagonist is young Joseph Kavanagh, a new recruit to the Wall. He is about to embark on his stint as a Defender and soon discovers his working environment is grim, a \"cold, hard, unforgiving, desperate place\" in which he feels \"trapped\".\n\nThe only way to reduce your stint on the Wall is to become a Breeder and have children, which might seem like a no-brainer but\u2026 \"people don't want to Breed, because the world is such a horrible place.\" So that's out.\n\nKavanagh is reasonable company. You wouldn't rush up to him at a school reunion, but he's a steady chap who might be missing a funny bone but at least is willing to engage in some Wall banter with his fellow recruits.\n\nHe is not a rebellious type. Nor is he particularly scathing about the State or questioning of its questionable moral compass. For instance, it used to allow a few Others \"who showed they had valuable skills\" to stay in the country. But not any more, because doing so would escalate the numbers attempting to gain entry.\n\nA self-defeating policy, you might think, at a time when the country is so short of manpower that Kavanagh's miserable two-year stretch on the Wall might have to be extended by another 12 months.\n\nSurely our rookie conscript would be full of righteous indignation, pointing out the contradictory logic of the state: if it was successfully discouraging the Others by being mean, wouldn't that result in fewer and not more Defenders needed on the Wall? It can't have it both ways, can it Kavanagh? Come on man, sharpen up!\n\nBut he doesn't. He's a trusting soul, which is always a mistake in a dystopian novel. Fortunately he's a good swimmer.\n\nJohn Lanchester's novel Capital became a BBC TV drama in 2015\n\nAnd fortunately for us, John Lanchester is a good writer. As you will know if you've read Whoops! - his non-fiction book about the 2008 financial crisis. He is also a decent novelist.

Dystopias are all the rage with producers at the moment: Black Mirror, The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games etc. It would probably require a little something extra, though.\n\nThe characters we meet in the book are fine as far as they go, which isn't very far in terms of personality development. They are a low-tech, rather parochial crowd, who aren't nearly as dreary as their environment, but you're unlikely to ever find them showboating in front of a table laden with Big Macs.\n\nUnlike Donald Trump, whose proposed wall is one of the many contemporary political issues Lanchester deftly alludes to in a book that owes more to One State's all-encompassing protective Green Wall in Yevgeny Zamyatin's early 1920s dystopian classic We than it does to the current US president's border project.\n\nThe novel We inspired an entire body of so-called speculative fiction including Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four. All are great works. Which The Wall isn't, quite.\n\nIt is very good: a well-structured, well-paced story with a narrative drive that keeps you going through the monotony of life on the Wall.

But what was supposed to be their big coming out week isn't going quite as planned.\n\nIf you're a tech company wanting to grab the world's attention this week, then Las Vegas could be the worst place to be.\n\nWhy? Well in the biggest CES yet with nearly 4,000 exhibitors you really have to shout very loud to be heard above the hubbub.\n\nIf you're a giant company like Sony or Samsung, you pour your marketing millions into spectacular press conferences and ridiculously lavish show floor exhibits where visitors have to wade through deep pile carpet while being deafened by loud music and shouty demos.\n\nSo, to arrive here as a one-man start-up with an innovative idea and try to get some attention requires both courage and optimism. Luckily Danny Manu has both in spades.\n\nWhen I met this young man from Manchester on the Las Vegas strip, he was desperately tired. His cheap flight from the UK had been delayed by eight hours on a Miami stopover - so he'd dashed from the airport to his AirBnB to drop his luggage, then came straight on to see me.\n\n\"I've not slept for 24 hours but I'm still moving and looking forward to it,\" he says.\n\nDanny's product is called Clik and he bills it as the world's first truly wireless earbuds with live translation. The idea is that you speak in one language and another person hears what you say in their own tongue, either via their own earbuds or via the MyManu smartphone app that Danny has already developed.\n\nSmart wireless earbuds and instant translation are ideas which giants like Apple and Google are addressing with vast investments - so it seems ridiculously ambitious for a one-man band to take them on.\n\nHe has already had a few setbacks. He'd hoped to have a working model ready for CES, but says delays in manufacturing in China mean the earbuds won't be ready for a few weeks.\n\nInstead, he demonstrates the system on a set of ear headphones, getting me to say Bonjour into an iPad which then comes out of his headphones as Hello.\n\nWe struggle with bad connectivity - often an issue when thousands are using the mobile networks at once - but Danny is hoping for a smoother demo in any of 37 languages when his stand is set up at the show.\n\nIt has been an extraordinary journey to get this far.

It's usually something done behind closed doors - but how would you feel about someone watching porn in public? The BBC's Siobhann Tighe describes a troubling experience on a London bus.\n\nIt had been a long day at work. I got on the bus at 7.30 in the evening and it was cold and drizzly. All the passengers were wrapped up in thick coats, hoods and hats.\n\nInside, the bus was softly lit and I was expecting to zone out on my way back home: just let the day go and switch off.\n\nI sat on the lower deck beside a complete stranger and didn't give it a second thought. I was just relieved to get a seat. As we meandered through the London traffic, my gaze was drawn to my neighbour's phone. I wasn't being nosy but in the dim light of the bus, the brightness of his mobile caught my attention even though he was slanting it slightly away from me.\n\nAlthough I didn't mean to or want to, I found myself looking over towards his mobile a few times and then it suddenly occurred to me what was going on. The man beside me was watching porn.\n\nOnce I realised, although I genuinely didn't mean to, my eyes kept on being pulled back to it. I couldn't quite believe it. First he was watching animated porn, with the two naked characters in lurid colours repeating their movements over and over again. Then he started watching a film, which seemed to begin in a petrol station with a large woman in a low-cut yellow top and blonde hair peering into the driver's window.\n\nI didn't hear any sound, apart from a brief few seconds when my fellow passenger pulled the headphone jack out of his mobile, and then reinserted it.\n\nThe man didn't seem to notice my glances towards his phone, maybe because his hood was hampering his peripheral vision. He seemed oblivious to me and others around him, who admittedly wouldn't have been able to see what I saw.\n\nWe eventually arrived at his bus stop and because he had the window seat and I had the aisle, he made a motion that he needed to get out, and he muttered a \"thank you\" as he squeezed past me. I watched him get off and walk down the street.\n\nI felt uncomfortable and annoyed, but I didn't do anything about it. I didn't say anything to him and neither did he pick up on any of my glances or quizzical looks. His eyes didn't meet mine so I couldn't even communicate my feelings non-verbally and it didn't occur to me to tell the driver. Even if I wanted to, it would have been difficult to get to the front of the bus because it was packed.\n\nBut when I got off, questions flooded into my mind about what I had just experienced. What if a child saw that? Are there any laws about looking at porn in public spaces? If there are laws, how easy are they to enforce? Why did this passenger feel public transport was an appropriate place to watch porn, and should I be worried from a safety point of view?\n\nAs a journalist, I also looked at it from his point of view, even though he made me feel uncomfortable. I asked myself: is he within his rights to look at porn on his private device wherever he is? Do civil liberties in our society grant him that freedom?\n\nBut in my heart, I was offended.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

the last three months of 2017.\n\nThe firm blamed snow and icy conditions, and warned many roads are \"hanging in the balance\" if conditions are particularly cold or wet in spring.\n\nDrivers can face a bill of hundreds of pounds if their cars hit a pothole.\n\nThe Department for Transport said it was investing \u00a323bn to increase capacity and improve road journeys.\n\nThe RAC was called to 2,830 pothole-related breakdowns between October and December, compared with 2,547 in the period a year before.\n\nRAC chief engineer David Bizley said the figures would be \"met with concern\" among drivers because potholes represent a \"serious road safety risk\".\n\nDriving into potholes can cause broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers and distorted wheels.\n\nAfter several years of improvements to road quality, the latest analysis suggests it has gone backwards for the third successive quarter, he said.\n\nMost potholes develop on local roads which councils are responsible for, rather than motorways and trunk roads.\n\nLocal councils warned on Thursday they would need to spend \u00a312bn to address the current backlog of road repair work, including fixing potholes.\n\nThe

labelling would change under its proposal\n\nThe Royal Society for Public Health is calling for change in alcoholic drinks labelling, citing a public \"awareness vacuum\" on how alcohol affects health.\n\nThe society wants it to be mandatory to include the government's guideline to drink no more than 14 units a week.\n\nDrink manufacturers could also warn of the link with health conditions such as bowel and breast cancer.\n\nBut a drink industry body said the public is \"strongly opposed to cramming more information on a pack\".\n\nIn its report, the RSPH suggests a drink-drive warning and using traffic light colour coding, similar to that used on many food items in the UK, could be helpful for drinkers.\n\nIn the context of food, traffic-light labelling shows you at a glance if it is low, medium or high in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt\n\nThe recommendations are based on a survey of almost 1,800 UK adults, which it conducted with the Portman Group, the alcohol industry standards body.\n\nThe society found calorie content labels could be effective and cause 10% of consumers to switch from the highest alcohol drinks to the lowest across all socio-economic groups. This effect was particularly pronounced among young drinkers.\n\nProf Shirley Cramer CBE of RSPH, said: \"The potential health consequences of alcohol consumption are more serious than many people realise,\" with 90% of Britons unaware of the link between alcohol and cancer.\n\nProf Cramer said that only one in six of the public was aware of the new alcohol 14-unit low-risk guidelines, despite them being introduced two years ago. She put this down to the drinks industry failing to update labels.\n\nWarnings are now mandatory on most products \"from tobacco to food and soft drinks, but alcohol continues to lag behind. If we are to raise awareness and reduce alcohol harm, this must change\", she said.\n\nProf Sir Ian Gilmore, of the Alcohol Health Alliance (AHA), welcomed the report: \"Alcohol is linked with over 200 disease and injury conditions, including heart disease, liver disease and at least seven types of cancer.\"\n\nHe accused alcohol producers, of wishing \"to withhold information on alcohol and health from the public\".\n\n\"It is clear from this research that the public want labels to include the drinking guidelines, and we know from our own research that 81% of the public want to see the guidelines on labels. Producers should accept this.\n\n\"We all have a right to know the drinking guidelines, along with the risks associated with alcohol, so that we are empowered to make informed choices about our drinking.\"\n\nBut John Timothy, of alcohol industry standards body the Portman Group, said the research showed \"there was little public interest in a radical overhaul of drinks labelling and strong opposition to cramming more information on packs\".\n\n\"The study shows that 86% of consumers only look at labels for factual information and branding with 80% saying they would like to see less cluttered labels.\"\n\nHe said the Portman Group continually updates guidance to alcohol producers so consumers are provided \"with accurate and accessible health information\".\n\nCall the midwife in Nairobi, Kenya, and you may receive a visit from someone like Margaret Wairimu Maina.\n\nShe sets off on foot looking something like an astronaut, carrying a backpack stuffed full of hi-tech gadgets designed to monitor a baby's health.\n\nThe pack includes a wind-up foetal doppler used for measuring the baby's heartbeat, a portable ultrasound screen, a life-light with matching solar panel, in-ear thermometers, and a range of other medical instruments related to pregnancy.\n\nThe gear has become crucial for her voluntary job as a community health worker.\n\nAlthough the backpack weighs just 5kg (11lb) it'", "PPL": 2.006829023361206, "PPL/lower": 0.931323856692154, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005365853003639589, "Min-5%": 9.35145321079329, "Min-10%": 7.836155351470499, "Min-20%": 6.1551300377600935, "Min-30%": 5.14104823452642, "Min-40%": 4.393084082597626, "Min-50%": 3.789654143977608, "Min-60%": 3.282144744568034}, {"text": "60, Barton directed more than 50 works - some adapted by him from the texts of Greek drama.\n\nHe was \"a Shakespeare genius\", RSC artistic director Gregory Doran said.\n\nActor Sir Patrick Stewart said \"the names William Shakespeare and John Barton will be for me forever united\".\n\nSir Patrick, who worked with Barton on The Merchant of Venice, said that no one in his career \"had the impact John had\".\n\nPaying tribute to a \"mentor and friend\", Doran said Barton was \"one of the greatest influences in the acting of Shakespeare of the last century\".\n\nGenerations of actors had been and still were influenced by Barton's series of Shakespeare workshops, Doran said.\n\nDoran recalled directing Malory's Morte d'Arthur, when Barton joined him for sessions \"in which he delivered whole sections of the book from memory, including, most wonderfully, the list of a hundred knights\".\n\nBarton's acclaimed productions include the War of the Roses, Twelfth Night, The Hollow Crown and The Greeks.\n\nJudi Dench, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen are among the actors to have worked with him.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

They pulled off unexpected election victories after being discounted by rivals and pundits.\n\nPollsters in both countries failed to predict Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump's upsets, and both party leaders were seen as celebrity lightweights by rivals.\n\nIt is a similarity not lost on Mr Trudeau.\n\nIn a 16 December interview with a Montreal radio show host, the prime minister revealed he touched on that \"common ground\" during his congratulatory phone call to Mr Trump following the US election.\n\n\"He and I had a conversation about being knocked around by the media because, present company excluded, that's the experience that I'd had for years of people just slamming me and saying 'he'd never become prime minister,'\" Mr Trudeau said.\n\n2. They embrace politics in the social media age.\n\nThe prime minister and the president-elect both use social media for their political ends.\n\nMr Trudeau and his team know a charming photo opportunity of the photogenic prime minister, from shirtless selfies to yoga poses, can go viral and bolster his popularity at home and abroad.\n\nHe has leveraged social media as a tool to sell his brand of progressive cool to the world.\n\nWhile Mr Trudeau has a healthy Twitter following for a world leader, with nearly 2.4m followers (and over 830,000 on Instagram), his influence on the platform is dwarfed by Mr Trump's 19.7m followers.\n\nA prolific tweeter, Mr Trump wields his influential account to attack opponents, drive the news, and pressure US manufacturers to bend to his agenda.\n\nHe has, however, promised to be more restrained in his Twitter antics after being sworn-in 20 January.\n\n3. They promised to change the way politics is done.\n\nMr Trump vowed during the campaign he would \"drain the swamp\", a catch-all promise for his supporters who see of Washington as a cesspool of lobbyists, corruption, and waste.\n\nDuring the 2015 Canadian election, Mr Trudeau said his predecessor, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, \"turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp\" during his near decade in power.\n\nMr Trudeau promised to put an end to partisanship and patronage in Ottawa, to usher in a more transparent and receptive government, and to make question period respectful again.\n\nThe two have faced critics who say those promises were quick to fall by the wayside.\n\nDonald Trump said he would 'Make America great Again'\n\n4. They harkened to the past in their pitch to voters.\n\nThe two politicians pressed some very powerful nostalgia buttons as they campaigned to lead their countries.\n\nMr Trump's inescapable campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\", borrowed from former US president Ronald Reagan's 1980 race, looked back to a time when voters felt there was more prosperity and opportunity in the United States and when their nation garnered respect on the world stage.\n\nMr Trudeau was more subtle, though his campaign was woven through with a thread of nostalgia, from a promise to recommit troops to overseas peacekeeping efforts to a foreign policy return to when Canadians thought the world saw the country as its good neighbour.\n\nAfter winning the election, Mr Trudeau and his MPs made \"Canada is back\" one of their favourite catchphrases.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, right, Justin Trudeau's father, with former US President Ronald Reagan\n\n5.

Dubbed \"gentlemen's gatherings\" in a recent profile in Vocativ, it took place at the city's ancient citadel, a UN world heritage site.\n\nMr Erbil hopes to promote a new image for the region\n\nThe pictures of the 20 men posing in latest Western men's fashion - specifically, the style recently associated with hipsters, replete with the trademark sharp suits, tight trousers and lovingly trimmed beards - became wildly popular on Instagram.\n\nWidely dubbed \"Iraq's first gentleman's fashion club\", Mr Erbil now has some 30 core members and more than 25,000 fans on Instagram, and a Facebook presence too.\n\nThe style may be Western, but Mr Erbil stress that what they are doing mixes \"modernity\" and cultural heritage, by harking back to the lifestyles of the traditional Kurdish landowning class, the effendis.\n\nThe favoured style appears to be mostly hipster-inspired\n\nAccording to the Vocativ article, in days past, the \"effendis\" - literally, \"lord\" or \"master\" - would dress in their finest clothes to attend cultural salons or visit tea shops.\n\nThe group says that the focus of their activity is to organise trade shows and cultural events to promote fashion as \"aesthetic expression\".\n\nBut it is not just about fashion - there is also a serious, almost political side.\n\nMr Erbil sees itself as something almost akin to a movement representing young Iraqi Kurds who are looking for a better life and want to promote Kurdish culture to the world.\n\nThe group even hopes to effect social change and challenge traditional attitudes, particularly on women's rights.\n\nThe Mr Erbil account frequently posts pictures and musings about women's issues in Kurdistan, Iraq and the world.\n\nThe group's account is very popular on social media\n\nThe effect Iraq's near-constant conflict has had on women's lives is also a frequent subject.\n\nEvery Thursday, Mr Erbil writes a post on the \"girl inspiration\", in which they promote women working on behalf of the community.\n\nOne of them is Dashni Morad, who gives workshops in leadership skills to women who survived the massacre and rape of members of northern Iraq's Yazidi sect by IS militants.\n\n\"The effort she puts in for humanity, love and peace is so impressive!\" says a post by Mr Erbil post on 19 January. \"Keep up the good work, you are making us proud.\"\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The state does little to look after them, so responsibility lies with the public - as Will Grant found when he befriended a ginger tomcat.\n\nMy younger sister sometimes reminds me of the apparent indifference I showed when our family cat, Pippit, died in 1991. A slender tabby who lived well beyond her expected years, Pippit enjoyed a long and happy life with us. Finally, at the impressive age of 21, she died just as we returned from a family holiday.\n\nWaking up to find that Pippit hadn't lasted the night, I took it upon myself to break the news to my sister. Sensitivity and tact weren't exactly high in my repertoire when I was 15 - I simply crashed into her room with the line: \"Helen, the cat's dead!\"\n\nI don't know if you've ever seen anyone wake up and immediately burst into tears, but I should take this opportunity to apologise to Helen for what was probably the meanest thing I did to her when we were growing up.\n\nSo, given she has this image of me as callous when it comes to pets - unfair, I hasten to add - she was surprised, when she visited Havana recently, to find just how much Cuba has influenced my attitude towards animals.\n\nThere are no state-funded pet rescue organisations on this communist island, so caring for neighbourhood strays is down to local businesses or residents.\n\nAround a dozen state institutions, from the Central Bank to the Museum of Metalwork, have adopted their own stray dogs. Under the scheme, the homeless hounds are named and duly issued with ID cards, which are placed on their collars to save them from the dog-catcher.\n\nVladimir, a former street dog, with his ID collar in Havana\n\nThe adoption system operates under the premise that they are now officially considered the government buildings' guard dogs, although the ones I've seen are docile street mutts rather than fierce Rottweilers.\n\nThe city government does operate a programme for neutering and spaying strays in Old Havana, but the handful of voluntary animal protection organisations that exist simply can't deal with the sheer numbers across the island.\n\nCubans are by and large dog people. There is a pretty significant culture of dog ownership, even among those who are barely scraping by.\n\nCats, on the other hand get a raw deal. Especially stray ones.\n\nSo, since we arrived in Cuba, we've tried to do our bit. We've already taken in two kittens we found lost and half-drowned during a torrential downpour one night. My girlfriend's mother is now the proud owner of the uniquely named Honorato and Carilda.\n\nBut for my sister, on her recent visit, it was my relationship with Django which really stood out.\n\nA ginger-and-white tomcat, he started life inside our building's parking garage. We would often hear a faint mewing after we parked the car.\n\nAs a kitten, Django would hide deep inside the motor of some diplomat's SUV, seeking refuge by nestling near the carburettor.\n\nOnce he grew a bit and emerged from the darkness of the car park, he was almost instantly adopted by the building.\n\nWe would leave food out for him. As would some Russian neighbours. So, apparently, did Sindi, one of the doormen. He looks like he could find a second job as a nightclub bouncer, but fell for the scruffy, soot-stained Django as much as we did.\n\nDjango was the name my Mum gave the kitten when she came to Havana and it stuck. We were smitten.\n\nEvenings would be interrupted and conversations broken off mid-flow so we could go out and feed him a mixture of leftovers and expensive kibble specially brought in from Mexico.\n\nThe treatment Django received in our building was well above the experience of most alley cats in Cuba with food regularly provided - if not by one neighbour, then another. Sometimes, both.\n\nThat brought with it the inevitable interest of other local waifs and strays. At one time there were three or four more trying to get in on the act. Fair enough - it's a dog-eat-dog world out there for a Cuban cat.\n\nStill, we began to worry. There is a nasty habit in Cuba of angry neighbours removing a constantly barking dog or an unsightly stray cat by feeding it mince laced with rat-poison.\n\nAlternatively - almost as cruelly - the witless pet might be shoved into the back of the", "PPL": 2.3797409534454346, "PPL/lower": 0.9816415693665614, "PPL/zlib": 0.0006166729602087159, "Min-5%": 10.224029120276956, "Min-10%": 8.787151785457835, "Min-20%": 7.12236344726861, "Min-30%": 6.008741121727015, "Min-40%": 5.150096065840686, "Min-50%": 4.458154394479791, "Min-60%": 3.872611876856232}, {"text": "There's a spirit of quirky eclecticism and larrikin [boisterous or maverick] humour in country Australia that comes out at these sorts of festivals.

Here he fondly recalls what life was like on the road with the former England manager.\n\nGraham Taylor and I sat next to one another in commentary boxes here, there and everywhere.\n\nThe first time we were squeezed together in one was for a not-terribly-high-profile match on a Friday night at Brentford. I can still see him bounding up the steps at Griffin Park, wearing a black and white checked jacket, cheerily acknowledging people as he came.\n\nAnd I remember thinking afterwards that Graham Taylor was everything I hoped he would be. He was good fun, charming, engaging, and he had lots to say about the players, the match and all matters surrounding it. And, off air, he wanted to know all about me.\n\nWhen I got to know him better, he would always be great company post-match, often late into the evening. I have never actually met his wife, Rita, his children, or his grandchildren, but I feel as though I have because Graham would tell you exactly what was going on in their lives.\n\nHe loved all sports, particularly athletics and cricket - Graham actually followed England on tour to South Africa. And, believe it or not, he enjoyed the music of both Vera Lynn and Adele, whose albums he bought.\n\nAs a match summariser, I knew that if the game wasn't very good and nothing was happening, Graham was someone you could go off at tangents with, because he had such a wide field of interests. During one such commentary, I remember us discussing how he used to take an annual holiday in Caister-on-Sea, and the merits of that Norfolk seaside town.\n\nBut don't go thinking he was a pushover. There was a steely core to Graham Taylor that all winners have, and he always struck me as one of life's natural leaders - I'm convinced that was one of the secrets behind the many successes he had.\n\nOnce, when we had lost our ticket in an underground car park in Innsbruck, he very nearly persuaded me to tailgate a car through the barrier.

He'd injured it somehow, but rather than withdraw from our broadcast team so close to the finals - which he had been advised to do - he travelled all around Austria and Switzerland in some discomfort but without a word of complaint.\n\nBeing under scrutiny as a football manager for most of his life, he could click a switch and go into serious mode at a moment's notice, and what he said carried a real authority.\n\nWe were both part of the commentary team in Montenegro for a European Championship qualifier when Wayne Rooney was sent off for kicking out at an opponent.\n\nThe next morning we were reporting on it into the Breakfast programme, and though Graham was bleary eyed when he arrived in the room, he sat down, clicked into action, and made perfect sense. I recall thinking that had he still been England manager, he would have answered the questions in exactly the same way.\n\nThe way things ended for him with England, and the criticism that came with that, clearly stayed with him. He would often reference it himself and was, sometimes I felt, almost too willing to talk about it.\n\nWe would always try to guide Graham away from large gatherings of England fans because of the greater possibility of someone saying something out of turn in those circumstances.

The 23-year-old thanked party members for \"putting their faith\" in him\n\nThe son of late Labour assembly member Carl Sargeant has been selected by party members to fight the by-election caused by his father's death.\n\nJack Sargeant, 23, was chosen by party members in Alyn and Deeside ahead of the by-election on 6 February.\n\nCarl Sargeant, who had represented Alyn and Deeside in the Assembly since 2003, was found dead in November.\n\nJack Sargeant said he would be \"seeking justice\" for his father and \"getting to the truth about the chain of events that led to his premature death\".\n\nHis father was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay days after losing his cabinet position amid allegations around his personal conduct.\n\nHe had vowed to clear his name, and the first minister has ordered an independent inquiry to consider the circumstances around his sacking.\n\nJack Sargeant said it had been \"extremely difficult\" for his family following the death of his father\n\nJack Sargeant said: \"I am humbled and honoured to have been selected as Labour's candidate.\n\n\"I would like to thank local Labour Party members for the faith they have placed in me.\n\n\"I will be standing on a platform of being a powerful voice for local people - in the proud tradition of my father.\"\n\nHe said he would listen to local concerns about the economy, health and education and promised to \"champion north Wales interests on all these issues\".\n\n\"Whilst friends from the wider Labour family across Britain will be welcome to visit and campaign alongside us to secure victory, I want to emphasise - this will be a locally run campaign,\" he added.\n\n\"I take nothing for granted in this by-election.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru announced that it had selected Carrie Harper on Wednesday.\n\nThe Conservatives had selected former nurse Sarah Atherton as their candidate for the by-election and community councillor Donna Lalek will stand on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nUKIP previously said they would only stand if Jack Sargeant failed to win the Labour nomination.\n\nConservative Sarah Atherton and Liberal Democrat Donna Lalek were the first two candidates selected\n\nCarrie Harper will fight the by-election for Plaid Cymru\n\nThis comes as no surprise but it does confirm that a by-election already due to take place under extraordinary circumstances is likely to be a highly charged affair with the son of the late Carl Sargeant looking to keep the memory of his father alive.\n\nOpposition parties will have to deal with the emotional weight that will inevitably surround his campaign and the undoubted popularity within Labour ranks of his late father, particularly in and around his hometown, and power base of Connah's Quay.\n\nJack Sargeant had made an effort to win the support of Labour members not just through his family connection but also with a focus on local jobs and skills.\n\nThis will presumably be a central part of his campaign, as will thoughts about his father, no matter how difficult that becomes for the leadership of a Welsh Labour party already facing deep divisions within its own ranks about the sacking of Carl Sargeant.\n\nPotential first-time buyers must typically save for eight years to afford a deposit to buy a home, data suggests.\n\nA typical 20% deposit in London is now more than \u00a380,000, according to the Nationwide Building Society.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, the average deposit could be closer to \u00a320,000, the lender said.\n\nThe squeeze on wages and low interest rates makes it more difficult to raise the money than a decade ago.\n\nThe Nationwide, which calculated that house prices rose by 2.6% in 2017, analysed its mortgage data for the cost of the typical first-time buyer's house purchase in each region, based on four times a buyer's income, and from this derived how much a 20% deposit would be.\n\nThe \u00a380,000-plus cost in London is about \u00a330,000 higher than a decade ago.\n\nIn other regions, such as the Midlands and northern England, deposit requirements are similar to 2007, when prices were at their pre-crisis peak. However, real earnings have generally fallen for young people since then and savings rates are low.\n\nThe Nationwide then calculated the length of time it would take for buyers in each region to save such a deposit, based on squirreling away 15% of their take-home pay.\n\nIn most regions, it would take about eight years for the typical buyer to save for a deposit. This rises to nine years in the South East of England and to nearly 10 years in London.\n\nLenders have been told by regulators to set stricter affordability requirements since the financial crisis, to avoid financial stress on the system and on individual borrowers.\n\nThis created noticeable extra pressure on the need for first-time buyers to save compared with before the financial crisis. Many have turned to parents and other relatives to help with the cost.\n\nIona Bain, founder of the Young Money Blog, said this could be dangerous for young borrowers.\n\n\"The Bank of Mum and Dad, or Granny and Grandad, can come with big legal pitfalls, particularly if you're borrowing money with a partner, while trying to grow your money in more exotic ways through crowdfunding or Bitcoin, for instance, could put your whole deposit at risk,\" she said.\n\n\"The only other alternative is to simply save harder for longer. That means putting all your spare change into a home where you'll have to live for many years to come, since you'll struggle to move up the housing ladder.\n\n\"That doesn't sound very attractive if you're not sure about your future and you're trying to keep all your options open.\"\n\nDan Wilson Craw, of the Generation Rent lobby group, said: \"High housing costs are eating into renters' take-home pay which makes saving for a deposit difficult in the country as a whole but near impossible in London and the South East of England.\n\n\"Renters deserve a stable home in return for their rent, but private tenancies simply do not offer this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, demand for mortgages remains relatively static, so lenders are still getting the custom.\n\nBank of England figures show that 65,139 mortgages were approved for house purchases, for new and existing owners, during November. This is very close to the average of the previous six months. The total value of these loans was \u00a311.9bn.\n\nThe figures come the day after the government claimed more than 16,000 first-time buyers have saved thousands of pounds as a result of changes to stamp duty.\n\nThe Autumn Budget abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers of homes up to \u00a3300,000. For properties costing up to \u00a3500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first \u00a3300,000.\n\nAccording to the government, the changes mean savings of up to \u00a35,000 for first-time buyers. Labour said cutting stamp duty just drove up house prices.\n\nWhere can you afford to live?

He's scored 14 goals this season - you need someone like that in this team. It seems like it's derailed what's going on.\"\n\nWhen asked if a move to China would surprise him, Wright said: \"Absolutely not.

I can't be concerned with nothing.\"\n\nThe former Juventus and Italy boss was then asked once more whether the Brazil-born forward would feature again for the Blues and responded with: \"Why not?\"\n\nHe added: \"There are lot of 'if' questions - I don't like to answer these types of questions.\"\n\nOn reports of interest from China, Conte told BBC Sport: \"I don't know and the club doesn't know anything about the reports of Costa to China.

Now, thanks to a graphic section of the unverified intelligence dossier on Donald Trump, the rest of the world does, too.\n\nSince the allegations were made public, the US president-elect has denied claims that he cavorted in Russia with prostitutes - and Russian officials have denied claims that they filmed it.\n\nThis week, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin told me that \"the Kremlin does not collect kompromat\".\n\nBut someone in Russia clearly does. And the sensational results periodically surface, either via the compliant state media or via the internet.\n\nLast spring was a case in point.\n\nA state-controlled TV channel, NTV, ran footage of former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in bed with his personal assistant, Natalia Pelevina. Not only was the material cringe-worthily intimate, it also revealed the couple bad-mouthing other members of Russia's notoriously divided opposition.\n\nThe tape helped divide them even further.\n\n\"It was shot inside a private apartment by the [Russian security service] FSB, there is no doubt about it,\" Ms Pelevina told the BBC, referring to what happened as an \"obvious smear campaign\".\n\nGrainy video footage showed Mr Kasyanov with his personal assistant in a bedroom\n\nThere is no evidence that America's president-elect was ever caught in a similar way. But Ms Pelevina argues that her own experience suggests that such an idea is not implausible.\n\n\"I would not rule out that the Russian FSB has something against Donald Trump. Because they collect those materials not just against enemies; they collect against so-called friends. Just in case it will come in handy one day,\" she said.\n\nSome argue that the FSB had no reason to ensnare Mr Trump before his presidential ambitions were public.\n\n\"What would have been the point?\" Frederick Forsyth, a spy author who worked for MI6 for 20 years, asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\n\"I don't think there's any indication that the man who was host of the game show Apprentice and builder of hotels was ever going to be anything important in the political world,\" he said.\n\nBut a former Russian intelligence agent dismissed that logic.\n\n\"Donald Trump was never just anyone. He was always a well-known businessman, not just a tourist,\" the former operative, who asked not to be named, pointed out.\n\n\"You call it 'kompromat', but it's just information. Everyone does it. You British gathered it on [Mikhail] Gorbachev, we gathered it on [Margaret] Thatcher. So theoretically, yes, it's possible,\" he said.\n\nIf Russian agents did gather such information, he said, then it would be no surprise that it got out.\n\n\"You can't be surprised by anything anymore, after Edward Snowden and after Wikileaks,\" the ex-agent said.\n\nThat is one reason why many Russians are unfazed by the allegations. Another is that they have seen it all before.\n\nThe most notorious victim of kompromat was Yury Skur", "PPL": 2.123077869415283, "PPL/lower": 0.9493862671088619, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005764533992438999, "Min-5%": 9.362255582622453, "Min-10%": 7.943586604267943, "Min-20%": 6.3563506591582355, "Min-30%": 5.334637058674319, "Min-40%": 4.570459274033171, "Min-50%": 3.9612572214120996, "Min-60%": 3.455729733897731}, {"text": "the continuing importance of the special relationship\n\nPresident Trump needs to demonstrate that he has the seriousness to be the leader of the West and that he has command of the issues. The American audience will be watching.\n\nTheresa May needs to tread carefully. There is much she needs from America, not least a trade agreement, but many in the UK would question deepening a \"special\" relationship with a president they intensely distrust.\n\nThe prime minister has promised to be \"frank\" in her discussions, but Britain outside the EU needs a close ally in Washington and Donald Trump is likely to get his invitation to visit Britain and stay in Buckingham Palace and risk the demonstrations such a visit may spark.\n\nFor the UK, trade is the centrepiece of the visit.\n\nWith the UK leaving the EU and its single market, Britain will need new trading relationships. Already trade between Britain and the US is worth \u00a3150bn ($188bn). What the prime minister is looking for is a \"bold and ambitious free-trade agreement\" with the US.\n\nSuch a trade deal cannot be concluded while the UK remains part of the EU but preparatory work can begin so that a trade agreement can be in place shortly after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.\n\nThe prime minister is a strong advocate of free trade versus protectionism\n\nThere will be discussions about reducing existing tariffs and making it easier for American and British citizens to work in each other's countries.\n\nProgress surely will be made but there are deep underlying differences. The president's core policy is \"America First\". Theresa May's slogan is \"Global Britain\". Donald Trump has spent this week signalling he is pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and bent on re-negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nBritain outside the EU, on the other hand, needs an open global trading system. Theresa May has to be an advocate for free trade in the house of a leader determined to protect first and trade second.\n\nDowning Street will also know that a deal with the US will strengthen its hand in its negotiations with Brussels.\n\nDuring the election campaign Donald Trump caused consternation in Europe and in the foreign policy establishment in Washington when he declared Nato \"obsolete\".\n\nOn one level it was an expression of American frustration that its European allies refused to share the burden of defence. Theresa May will surely support the president in calling on Europe to spend 2% of GDP on its military.\n\nThere are calls for more Nato countries to share the alliance's financial burden\n\nBut May will be looking for much more. She wants to hear the President commit to Nato's Article Five, that an attack on one member will be treated as an attack on all.\n\nFor her, Nato is part of the post-war international order. Britain outside the EU needs Nato more than ever. In the future it will be Nato that will be the UK's link to its European neighbours.\n\nOne of the ironies of the visit is that Theresa May will fight for the EU. It will be a case of a divorcee speaking up for a former partner.\n\nEurope has been shocked by Donald Trump's comments about Europe breaking up, about the EU being a \"vehicle for Germany\". For the first time since the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago, Europe does not have a friend in the White House who shares the mission and belief in European integration.\n\nSo Theresa May has an opportunity to win friends in Europe's capitals by standing up for the EU. It is not in Britain's interest, as she has said, for the European Union to unravel. \"It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain's national interest that the EU should succeed,\" she believes.\n\nDespite Brexit, Mrs May could speak up for the European Union\n\nA global Britain needs a strong international order and part of that is Nato, the EU, and open trade. In the past it has been the US underpinning this global order. Theresa May will need to be the great persuader.\n\nThe UK views Moscow and Putin differently from the new administration in Washington. Donald Trump has signalled that he can open a new era with Russia.\n\nThe UK remains deeply suspicious of the Kremlin. It is not just a question as to whether sanctions should be retained against Russia for its military actions in Crimea and Ukraine.\n\nThe UK and US have the strongest intelligence-sharing relationship in the world. The UK will want reassurance that any tilt towards Russia does not compromise its intelligence assets.\n\nRegarding the Middle East, Donald Trump has made it clear that Israel will have his full support. Already, Israel has taken heart from its new friend in the White House by announcing the building of new settlements in the West Bank. Donald Trump has suggested he may move the US embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nTheresa May's words will be scrutinised closely. In seeking a close relationship with Donald Trump, will there be any change in emphasis in supporting a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians?\n\nDowning Street will seek reassurance over the effects of closer ties between the US and Russia\n\nThe British prime minister will also want to talk about energy and her commitment to the Paris agreement on reducing global warming.\n\nIn the end it is in both Britain and America's interest to forge a close relationship. Theresa May has spoken of \"renewing our nation's ties\".\n\nOutside the EU, the UK needs the American embrace. The Trump administration brings opportunities. Donald Trump remains an enthusiast for Brexit. He wants Brexit to succeed and has promised to give his backing to a trade deal.\n\nBut many of his policies are opposed by Theresa May and many British voters. She cannot risk getting too close to a man despised by many in the UK.\n\nHer priority will be trade but what she wants from the 45th president is a commitment to supporting the post-war international order without pulling away at the threads that bind it.\n\nOn a personal level they are unlikely allies, but self-interest may yet rekindle the Reagan-Thatcher alliance.\n\nTheresa May is preparing to meet new US President Donald Trump. Here's a look back at some first encounters of UK prime ministers and new US presidents:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Gordon Brown's first meeting with Barack Obama came amid a global economic crisis\n\nThe election of Barack Obama came at the tail end of the Labour government.\n\nEmbroiled in both economic and political crisis, Gordon Brown spotted President Obama's election as an opportunity to be touched by the gold dust of the newly elected president.\n\nIn March 2009, Downing Street proudly boasted that Mr Brown was the first European leader President Obama had met.\n\nThe first meeting was dominated by the global financial crisis and the upcoming G20 summit in London.\n\nHowever, there was some embarrassment when President Obama gifted a box of US films to Brown - on DVDs that did not work on UK players.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I expect great things because he's a great player.\"\n\nFederer, who has spent 302 weeks as world number one, has fallen to 16th in the rankings, his lowest position since May 2001.\n\nThat means he could face Britain's world number one Sir Andy Murray or defending champion Novak Djokovic as early as the fourth round of the Australian Open, which starts on 16 January.\n\nHaving reached the semi-finals in Melbourne last year, an early exit would further impact on his ranking.\n\nAnnacone feels that will not matter to Federer at this stage of his career, citing the example of Sampras, who won the US Open in 2002 as the 17th seed.\n\n\"It's not ideal but I'm a glass half-full guy,\" said the 53-year-old. \"I would imagine if you talked to Andy or Novak they're not going to want to be playing Roger in the round of 16 or third round either.\n\n\"I was with Pete Sampras when he won his 2002 US Open. He hadn't won an event for 26 months. With these great players, you just don't know what they're capable of. The rules don't apply - they're merely suggestions.\n\n\"I remember it with Pete.

I'm sure Roger's approaching it the same way.\"\n\nAs if to underline that, Federer said on Friday: \"Winning titles is a beautiful feeling; rankings at the moment... completely secondary. As long as I'm healthy, I think I can really do some damage.\"\n\nCan he make more history?\n\nFederer, who has won more Grand Slams than any other male player, will be 36 in August, and Annacone says he does not need to chase history for motivation.\n\n\"I just think the sheer joy of competing and the challenge of testing himself against the others will be enough for Roger,\" he said. \"He's so at peace with what he's done and where he is that he'll do it organically by himself.\n\n\"If he stays healthy and is able to train and compete as often as he's planning to then I would consider that a success.\n\n\"If he does that, his average level, for how talented he is, is going to be somewhere in the top 10 anyway. If that's the case, that average level will create opportunities where he is playing at the end of events.\"\n\nAnnacone, who keeps in touch with Federer \"via texts and instant messaging\", says the Swiss has been \"in good spirits\".\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago he was doing great, he was really happy in his training in Dubai,\" he said. \"His body felt good and he was really excited about 2017.\"\n\nBut Annacone, who will be commentating on the Australian Open for Tennis Channel, says Federer must \"stay patient\" in the early stages of his comeback.\n\n\"He is so meticulous in his preparation that I expect him to play pretty terrific tennis pretty quickly,\" he added.\n\n\"Now can he do it second event in, the Australian Open, for seven matches?

with their four previous victories over Premier League opposition in the Carabao Cup giving them a taste of what they hope is to come.\n\nGuardiola has previously used this competition to rest and rotate a number of his star players, but he picked a near full-strength side for the second leg, making just two changes to the team that beat Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nHis selection was tribute to the way Bristol City had performed at the Etihad a fortnight ago, impressing many with their adventure and attacking intent.\n\nThere would be no such repeat at Ashton Gate, however, with the away side taking complete control almost from the very first whistle.\n\nAguero's cross clipped the bar and David Silva's low shot had to be palmed away even before Sane's opener - and once Manchester City were able to add a ruthless streak to their overall dominance it was always going to be a big ask for the home team.\n\nDespite the impressive late rally, culminating in makeshift striker Flint stabbing in for 2-2, the visitors were still more than good value for their victory across both legs.\n\nThey had 68% possession and finished Tuesday's game with 28 shots on goal, scoring from three of the six they got on target.\n\nCan Man City do the quadruple?\n\nGuardiola is now just one game from winning his first silverware with Manchester City, having endured only the second barren season of his managerial career in 2016-17.\n\nThe 47-year-old Spaniard, who won 14 trophies in four years as Barcelona boss and a further seven in three years at Bayern Munich, is hoping to lead City to an unprecedented quadruple.\n\nHe has repeatedly played down his team's chances of achieving that feat, yet they continue to fight strongly on all fronts - already 12 points clear in the Premier League, they have also reached the last 16 of the Champions League and the fourth round of the FA Cup.\n\nDomestically, only Liverpool have found a way to beat them so far this season, meaning the one apparent remaining question mark is over whether they can translate their league and cup form into European competition.\n\nIf they are able to progress beyond FC Basel and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, even at this early stage they may seldom have a better opportunity of sealing a clean sweep of league and cups.\n\nA step too far for brave Bristol City\n\nLee Johnson and his players earned plenty of plaudits after their first-leg defeat, with Guardiola describing Bristol City as a \"fantastic team\" and lauding their style of play and attacking intent as \"good for the show\".\n\nDespite trailing on aggregate throughout the second leg, the fact they became only the second team since October to score twice in a domestic match against Manchester City spoke volumes of both their quality and spirit.\n\nThe Robins had already seen off top-flight sides Watford, Crystal Palace, Stoke City and famously Manchester United on their way to the last four - though two legs against the runaway Premier League leaders was always going to be a tall order.\n\nFollowing a tentative opening period, during which they were pinned back for long spells, they looked much more of a threat with the half-time arrival of \u00a35.3m summer signing Famara Diedhiou.\n\nHead coach Johnson will now hope the return of Diedhiou, who has missed the past three months with a knee injury, can also inspire his side towards achieving the ultimate goal of securing top-flight football for the first time since 1980.\n\nWhat they said:\n\nBristol City boss Lee Johnson: \"We came close to a draw. They are a top, top side, probably the best side I've seen live.\n\n\"They have so many players that are intricate and have class on the ball and sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say 'they are a better side than us'.\n\n\"But the spirit we showed, we never gave in and we continued to try and attack and scored two goals and not many teams can score two goals against a side like that.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: \"We are so happy to be there, to reach this final. We played an amazing game until 2-0 and then we lost control, these type of games never end until the end.\n\n\"At 2-0 we knew it would be easier because they needed three or four goals but with one minute left it was 2-2 and anything could happen.\n\n\"It's not for me, it's for Manchester City, a club who are trying to reach another level.

The two governments agree that in some areas common frameworks will be required.\n\n\"I regret that it has not been possible to bring forward amendments at the report stage but our commitment to improve the bill remains absolute. The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides, and talks between Scotland's two governments will continue.\"\n\nA series of summits between ministers from around the UK have failed to resolve the impasse over post-Brexit powers\n\nHe added: \"I remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish Parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation.\n\n\"The two governments have made good progress on how powers should be brought back from Brussels, including through the JMC(EN) meetings, and expect to make further progress in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nThe Scottish government's Brexit minister, Mike Russell, told Holyrood that the UK government's failure to introduce the amendments in the House of Commons was \"very regrettable\" and \"unacceptable\", but said that talks over the bill would continue.\n\nHe added: \"We have spent six months discussing bringing forward this amendment, and no amendment has been brought forward.\"\n\nLots of frustration at the announcement tonight there won't be changes to the Withdrawal Bill next week.\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell had promise amendments to reflect concerns over the impact the bill will have on devolution at report stage. But today he confirmed that's not happening now; there's been no agreement with Edinburgh and ministers in London don't want to bring the changes until that happens.\n\nMy sources say the departure of Damian Green - who had chaired high-level meetings with the Scottish government on this - didn't help. Nor did the fact the next parliamentary stage of the bill is happening a bit earlier than most expected.\n\nIt doesn't mean changes won't happen. The government says it's still committed to amendments, but they'll happen in the Lords instead.\n\nBut the Scottish Tories aren't happy. This morning, Tory MPs were still expecting the changes next week. I've heard the words \"frustrated\" and \"disappointed\" from a few. They're meeting tonight as a group to discuss the next steps.\n\nThe SNP are furious because it means MPs won't get to scrutinise the changes. Labour are too; they say it shows contempt for democracy.\n\nThe Scottish Tories will, I believe, ultimately be happy as long as the changes do happen in the Lords. But tonight there are a lot of angry faces across the parties.\n\nScottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said he too was \"deeply frustrated and disappointed\" that the amendments had not been made yet, and that he had been led to believe the bill would have been changed by now.\n\nHe also said it was \"imperative\" the legislation was passed at Westminster with the Scottish Parliament's consent.\n\nThe UK and Scottish governments are locked in a dispute over what will happen to powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels.\n\nUK ministers want them all returned to Westminster in the first instance, before some are devolved and some woven into UK-wide frameworks - but Scottish and Welsh ministers term this a \"power grab\".\n\nIn a report published on Tuesday, Holyrood's constitution committee - which includes Conservative MSPs - backed the Scottish government's stance, and said the bill was currently \"incompatible with devolution\".\n\nThe argument over the EU Withdrawal Bill focuses on Clause 11, which deals directly with the devolved administrations and the powers coming back from Brussels post-Brexit.\n\nThe clause has been attacked by groups including the Scottish government, SNP MPs at Westminster and even Scottish Conservative MPs, one of whom described it as \"not fit for purpose\".\n\nMSPs on the constitution committee unanimously added their weight to this, saying that \"Clause 11, as currently drafted, is incompatible with the devolution settlement in Scotland\".\n\nThey said the committee \"will not be in a position to recommend legislative consent for the bill unless Clause 11 is replaced or removed\", adding that resolving this should be \"a matter of priority\" for the UK government.\n\nCommittee convener Bruce Crawford said that in its present form, the bill \"represents a fundamental shift in the structure of devolution in Scotland\".\n\nOpposition party leaders met at Westminster to talks about Brexit on Tuesday morning - with an empty chair for Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBut Mr Tomkins, the deputy convener of the committee, welcomed the \"progress that has been made\" in \"developing an approach to agreeing common UK frameworks\" for returning powers.\n\nAnd he said members \"welcome the UK government's commitment to respect the devolution settlement\".\n\nScottish Brexit minister Mike Russell - who welcomed the committee's report - has said the government is looking at the possibility of introducing its own \"continuity\" legislation, should it fail to come to an agreement over the UK bill.\n\nThe committee said this approach would result in \"a reduced timetable for parliamentary scrutiny\", urging the government to engage in \"early discussions\" with the parliament about this.\n\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments jointly put forward potential amendments to the Withdrawal Bill during the early part of its progress through Westminster, but saw them rejected by MPs.\n\nHowever, Mr Mundell told MPs on 6 December that \"the bill will be amended\", later clarifying that this would \"happen on report\".\n\nMeanwhile, MSPs have been debating the Brexit process and the position of the remaining EU member states on their first day back after the festive recess.\n\nThey discussed evidence gathered by the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee on the Brexit process, which began with the triggering of Article 50 in March 2016.\n\n", "PPL": 1.9566818475723267, "PPL/lower": 0.9270618095540616, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005555598658638065, "Min-5%": 9.275883987838148, "Min-10%": 7.806300460123548, "Min-20%": 6.161311723783721, "Min-30%": 5.14036083066114, "Min-40%": 4.369938115764655, "Min-50%": 3.734342688281282, "Min-60%": 3.21490643467111}, {"text": "has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What the world thinks of Trump\n\nAt the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment.\n\nMr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased.\n\nThe total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years.\n\nSome of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US.\n\nAnother survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign.\n\nThere were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap.\n\nMr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line.\n\nMaking waves? Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades.\n\nIn a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers.\n\n\"For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,\" the president said. \"But all that changed the day I took the oath of office.\"\n\nWhile it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues.\n\nShortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception).\n\nThe government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances.\n\nMr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history.\n\nOn 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory.\n\nMaking waves? President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down.\n\nMr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark.\n\nUnemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015.\n\nThe hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, a small-business confidence index hit the highest level in its 45-year history.\n\nOf course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge.\n\nIn a recent Quinnipiac survey that showed 66% of the public believes the economy is \"excellent or good\", 49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump.\n\nMaking waves? The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an \"America First\" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action.\n\nThe president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements\n\nMr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him \"little rocket man\" and saying his nation would be met with \"fire and fury\" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric.\n\nThe most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa.\n\nIn Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants.\n\nMr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community.\n\nWith great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed.\n\nMaking waves? Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some\n\nThere's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump.\n\nNo one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage.\n\nFor many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke.\n\nThey asked for different, and different is what they got.\n\nMr Trump has said", "PPL": 1.9656625986099243, "PPL/lower": 0.9965486502101983, "PPL/zlib": 0.0004909247249275535, "Min-5%": 9.318482099794874, "Min-10%": 7.9530320588280174, "Min-20%": 6.343212038497179, "Min-30%": 5.25079984773642, "Min-40%": 4.427527521379419, "Min-50%": 3.7739352635158006, "Min-60%": 3.2344264062151846}, {"text": "be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained within the EU's single market and customs union.\n\n\"If that's the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn't worry about it,\" Lord O'Neill said ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where there are likely to be a number of positive growth upgrades published for the global economy.\n\n\"Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we'll probably suffer more than that 3%.\n\n\"But if it is only 3%, what's going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily.\"\n\nLord O'Neill said it was ironic that Britain was leaving the EU at just the time growth was increasing across the continent, given that one of the arguments for leaving was unshackling the UK from a number of \"sclerotic\" European economies.\n\nBetter global growth helps UK exports - an important driver of the British economy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

They're like 'there you go, told you so', which of course is ridiculous\".\n\nLord O'Neill said that major sectors of the economy that are closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats because of the government's proposals to leave the customs union and the single market.\n\nChina's economy has been buoyant in recent months\n\nOver the past six months economic forecasts have become more bullish on world growth.

World trade - just when everybody's trying to write it off - has actually risen sharply.\"\n\nHe said that President Donald Trump's reforms of the tax system and plans to loosen regulatory controls would boost the US economy.\n\n\"The secular stagnation that the likes of Larry Summers [the former US Treasury Secretary] have talked about for a few years looks suspiciously dodgy.

But why do these shortages persist and is there anything that can be done to get rid of them?\n\nIn this week's In Business on BBC Radio 4, I spoke to historians, economists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare staff to try to get to the bottom of these questions.\n\nAnd to pose another one - does the NHS have the right mix of staff with the right mix of skills or could changing traditional roles rather than just boosting numbers help?\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing says England is currently short of at least 20,000 nursing staff.\n\nAnd the Royal College of Midwives says the country needs 3,500 more midwives.\n\nMeanwhile, GP leaders and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine say the UK urgently needs greater numbers of general practitioners and emergency doctors - just a few of the medical specialities struggling with recruitment and retention right now.\n\nIncreasingly, an older population, with often complex health needs, adds extra demand.\n\nBut these problems are far from new.\n\nStephanie Snow, medical historian at the University of Manchester, says staff shortages have existed since the very birth of the NHS, in 1948 - though people are often quick to label recruitment crises as one-off problems.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"Over the first decade in particular, the NHS expanded its specialist services rapidly and there were many new technologies on board.\n\n\"All of these things led to unprecedented increases in the number of staff required.\n\n\"By the time we get to the late 1960s, hospitals had to turn to mass recruitment, looking towards countries such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - where courses were taught in English and aligned to the UK's General Medical Council, as a consequence of colonial rule.\"\n\nPhysician associates are a relatively new role within the NHS\n\nMeanwhile, Anita Charlesworth, director of Research and Economics at the think tank, the Health Foundation, argues the UK has perpetually trained lower numbers of medical and nursing students than it needs.\n\nShe said: \"There is not a problem that we don't have enough bright, young people who would meet the standards and would love to have a career in medicine and nursing.\n\n\"They just can't get a place. We have systematically trained fewer than we need.\"\n\nAnd she suggests being able to recruit doctors and nurses from overseas has offered a \"get out of jail card\" for successive staff shortages.\n\nDr Mark Porter, of the doctors' union, the British Medical Association, argues we have generally staffed a health service we can afford - rather than look at what the population needs.\n\nBut he says planning for the NHS workforce of the future is not easy.\n\nHe said: \"It is difficult to get planning perfect for every one of 50 or 60 specialities all of the time.\n\n\"The population's needs are genuinely not quite as predictable as one might imagine.\n\n\"We know the trajectory illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are taking over the next five years.\n\n\"But what about the next 25 years?\n\n\"Will public health messages and new technology be successful, or won't they?\n\n\"The answer could give us completely different trajectories in the future.\"\n\nNurses starting work on the first day of the NHS\n\nFor its part, the government says it plans to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses it trains and boost other healthcare staff too.\n\nAt the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said: \"My job is to prepare the NHS for the future, and that means doing something today that we have never done properly before, and that's training enough doctors.\"\n\nThe government announced there would be up to an extra 1,500 medical school places each year from 2018 in England.\n\nAnd, looking back, the NHS Confederation said there had been an extra 32,467 doctors employed in England in 2014 compared with 2004.\n\nHealth chiefs also say current plans to scrap nurse bursaries will help increase the number of nurse training places available this year - though whether this will work in practice is unclear and has been disputed by nursing leaders.\n\nOther positions such as nurse apprentices and physician associates are being explored.\n\nPhysician associates (PAs) - trained to do some of the jobs junior doctors do, might be able to cut some pressures on wards.\n\nBut current numbers are tiny, most cannot prescribe and they are not professionally regulated in the same way doctors are.\n\nMs Charlesworth is worried options for filling shortages quickly might be running out.\n\nShe said: \"There's a massive gap globally now in the number of doctors and nurses compared to projected demand.\n\n\"So India keeps many more of its doctors.\n\n\"It has fantastic leading hospitals that are an exciting place to work if you are a young Indian doctor.\n\n\"There is a global shortage of clinical healthcare staff.\"\n\nAnd of course there is another issue to consider.\n\nIt is estimated about 10% doctors and 7% of nurses working in the NHS in England are nationals of other EU countries.\n\nThe question is -

Footage of car on fire in Londonderry\n\nA bomb has exploded inside a car outside the courthouse in Londonderry.\n\nThe explosion occurred in Bishop Street at about 20:15 GMT on Saturday, shortly after police received a warning.\n\nOfficers were on the scene when the blast occurred. No one is believed to have been injured.\n\nPolice had just started evacuating nearby buildings, including a hotel, when the explosion took place. A cordon remains in place at the scene.\n\nLocal politicians have told the BBC that the vehicle was hijacked in Derry some time before the explosion.\n\nAn eyewitness told the BBC: \"The remains of the car could still be seen burning in the middle of the road.\n\n\"A cordon has been set up around the scene and police are evacuating more buildings on Bishop Street.\"\n\nThe cordon remained in place on Sunday morning as officers inspect the scene\n\nIn a statement issued on Facebook, the PSNI said: \"As far as we know no one [is] injured.\"\n\nHowever, they said that there is another car they \"are not happy about\" and are evacuating the area and advising residents in the area to make preparations to leave.\n\nGreg McLaughlin, who lives nearby, said his windows shook with the force of the blast.\n\n\"It was very, very loud. I knew right away this was a bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"We knew it was quite close.\n\n\"You could see the ball of fire on the street. It sounded to me like a very significant blast. I haven't heard anything like it in Derry for quite a while.\"\n\nBusinesses and other properties have been evacuated and the cordon on Bishop Street has been extended.\n\nOne business owner said she heard a bang and was lucky to be inside at the time. She said she could have been on the street minutes later.\n\nThe PSNI has asked members of the public to stay away.\n\nColin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the explosion had caused major disruption in the Bishop Street area of the city.\n\n\"This has to be condemned in its strongest terms, taking place on a Saturday evening when many people are out enjoying themselves.\n\n\"The loss of trade for the local hospitality sector and the impact that this will have on tourism and the local economy benefits no one.\"\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was concerned at the reports coming from Londonderry and was \"being kept informed by PSNI\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MP Elisha McCallion said the incident had \"shocked the local community\".\n\n\"In particular, there are many elderly residents who live in the area who have been alarmed by this incident,\" she said.\n\nSDLP MLA Mark H Durkan tweeted: \"Whoever is responsible for this explosion outside Bishop Street Courthouse in Derry clearly hasn't got the message that the people of Derry DO NOT want this on our streets.\"\n\nThe DUP MLA, Gary Middleton, described the incident as a \"disgraceful act of terrorism\".\n\nHis party leader Arlene Foster tweeted: \"This pointless act of terror must be condemned in the strongest terms. Only hurts the people of the city.\n\n\"Perpetrated by people with no regard for life. Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries.\"\n\n\"There is no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHow long do you wait to see your GP?\n\nMembers of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group report waits of three weeks or more are common.\n\nLisa Johns said: \"Ours book five weeks ahead. For the last three weeks, I've been trying to book a standard appointment and can't get one, as they go in seconds.\"\n\nAnother member posted: \"I booked a non-urgent appointment with my GP last week.... for 22 January 2019.\"\n\nTheir experiences are backed up by statistics.\n\nEarlier this month, NHS Digital published figures showing that, while 40% of patients were seen on the day they booked, just under a fifth waited longer than a fortnight for a routine appointment with a GP or practice nurse.\n\nBut what's the story behind these figures?\n\nHave waits actually got longer?\n\nThe NHS Digital figures show of 307 million appointments booked at practices in England between November 2017 and October 2018:\n\nIt is the first time such figures has been published - so there aren't similar figures to compare them with. But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.'

This was a different stage with different prizes on offer - but it was an occasion that was just as charged.\n\nKlopp, in 15 months, has revitalised Liverpool and given hope to supporters longing to end the wait for a first title since 1990. And as they continue their pursuit of relentless Chelsea, belief continues to grow that the charismatic German can still haul in Antonio Conte's side.\n\nLiverpool's manager was, as usual, celebrating with his players after the final whistle before pumping his chest in mock relief in front of Anfield's huge new Main Stand.\n\nAnd, when City fleetingly threatened a second-half comeback, he turned cheerleader in front of those same fans with a demand to lift the noise levels that was met instantly.\n\nKlopp has become the new Anfield talisman. Under him, the transformation of his team and the mood around the club continues.\n\nSomething else that will give Liverpool's fans great heart is the way in which Klopp is getting results against his closest rivals.\n\nSince his appointment in October 2015, Klopp has faced a total of 13 Premier League games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. He has lost only one - a single goal defeat by United last season.\n\nHe has also enjoyed a Europa League win over two legs against United, although the balance is redressed slightly by a loss on penalties against Manchester City in last season's Capital One Cup final.\n\nLiverpool - and indeed Manchester City - are having to run to stand still in the Premier League title race, with Chelsea stretching their winning run to 13 games as they beat Stoke City earlier on Saturday.\n\nIt meant this was a game both sides needed to win - hence the contrasting emotions of Klopp and Guardiola at the final whistle.\n\nLiverpool are underdogs but six points is still a gap that can be closed and Chelsea have to visit Anfield on 31 January.\n\nKlopp's players have shown strength of character with their response to setbacks earlier this month, when they lost 4-3 at Bournemouth and drew 2-2 at home to West Ham.\n\nThey have also shown they can win in different ways. Recent victories over Middlesbrough and Stoke showcased a free-flowing style. At Everton and against City, they toughed it out - and answered questions about a supposedly vulnerable defence. It is evidence that Liverpool must be taken very seriously as title challengers.\n\nIt is far too early to dismiss a manager of Guardiola's ability - and a team of City's talents - in terms of the Premier League title race. However, the 10-point gap between themselves and Chelsea is starting to look as if it will only be overturned by extraordinary events.\n\nCity were too timid for too long here at Anfield. Sergio Aguero - returning after a four-match ban - was starved of service, while Kevin de Bruyne was marginalised and largely snuffed out by Liverpool's intense pressing style.\n\nIt was still David Silva who called the shots when they did put some moves together after the break but Yaya Toure could not exert serious influence.\n\nGuardiola's task should at least be put in context. City were a team short on inspiration and spark for much of last season under Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps it was too much to expect even a manager of Guardiola's pedigree to apply an instant fix.\n\nCity should never be ruled out. But on the evidence of this flat performance - and the growing sense that significant renewal of the squad is still needed - dragging back Chelsea may be beyond them for this season.\n\n'I don't care about criticism' - what they said\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I know everyone talks about our defence. It's not about avoiding goals - that's the end product - it's about how we work together.\n\n\"I think we have the smallest number of shots on our goal in the league. Tonight the concentration level was outstanding.\n\n\"I don't care about criticism of our defence. You always pick out things that aren't right but that's how goals are.\"\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was an equal game. The goal made it difficult against a team who use the counter-attack like a master. The second half was much better.\n\n\"We have to wake up for another game. We need to focus and work - we can't think about the big goals.\"\n\nFormer England defender Phil Neville: \"It was a poor game. I was so disappointed by how poorly Manchester City passed the ball. They didn't get back into shape quick enough.\n\n\"Aleksandar Kolarov should have been winning that header against Georginio Wijnaldum. They were really poor in possession and well off the pace.

People who have money can afford good food in this country.\n\n\"When you haven't got any money [and] you're living on a low income, to patronise and sit there and say, 'You've got to have an organic chicken' is wrong.\n\n\"People don't have the time to shop and the time to cook. Everyone says we're a more unhealthy nation than ever and yet we're not doing anything about it.\"\n\nHartnett in 2003 after she took charge at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at The Connaught hotel\n\nHartnett recalled her grandmother never threw food away, adding people were now a \"bit lazy\" about that.\n\nThe 49-year-old also told presenter Kirsty Young that by \"working and working and working\" in pursuit of her career as a chef, TV presenter and cookery writer, she had left it too late to have children.\n\n\"That's one regret unfortunately, but other than that I'm very happy with what's gone on,\" she said.\n\nHartnett also said the one person she cannot cook alongside is her soon-to-be husband, Neil Borthwick, a chef she met when she headed the Gordon Ramsay-owned restaurant at The Connaught hotel.\n\nShe said: \"He's a brilliant cook and he's got a great palate but he's messy and it drives me insane at home.\"\n\nDesert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 GMT on Sunday, or listen later on iPlayer\n\nGillian Ewing was one of six people killed in the crash\n\nThe family of bin lorry crash victim Gillian Ewing have agreed an \u00a3800,000 compensation deal with Glasgow City Council.\n\nThe deal follows a legal fight by Ms Ewing's daughter after her mother and five others were killed by an out-of-control truck driven by Harry Clarke.\n\nA fatal accident inquiry found Clarke lost consciousness at the wheel before the crash in December 2014.\n\nThe compensation case was settled out of court last month.\n\nThe payout to Ms Ewing's daughter Robyn, 28, and six other relatives is the first by the local authority to the victims' families.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Watch drone footage of the swollen river Seine in Paris\n\nRiverside homes and businesses in Paris are on high alert as the swollen River Seine threatens to overflow its banks.\n\nWeeks of rainfall have produced a relentless rise in the water level, which is expected to peak just below 6m (20ft) above normal.\n\nTouring boats are tied up, riverside roads are sealed off and the Louvre museum has closed a lower gallery.\n\nFrance has seen rain like this over the New Year period only three times in the last century.\n\nThe surging brown waters are also reportedly flushing rats out of their usual haunts below ground, the BBC's Kevin Connolly reports from the French capital.\n\nWithin Paris, the Seine runs in a deep channel which limits the effects of the rising waters. But in smaller towns along the river, our correspondent adds, shoppers and commuters have been punting boats along flooded streets. They are waiting for the waters to recede to allow the first estimates of the financial cost of the flooding to be made.\n\nA statue of a French soldier from the Crimean War- known as The Zouave - on the Pont de l'Alma has long been used as a marker for water levels in the city.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the water was still well below his waist; during the historically bad floods of 1910, when the city was submerged for two months, it reached his neck.\n\nAs of 09:00 (08:00 GMT) on Saturday, the river level had reached 5.7m above normal.\n\nParisian anglers are getting closer to the fish\n\nWhile forecasters believe it will continue to rise, peaking on Sunday night or Monday, it is not expected to reach the 2016 high of 6.1m, AFP news agency reports.\n\nSaying the city was coping, Mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested the flooding, coupled with recent summer heat waves, was \"clearly a question of the town adapting to climate change\".\n\nShe warned that the high water levels would remain into next week, as water levels subside slowly due to waterlogged soil in the region.\n\nAt the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert.\n\nPerching seagulls are barely out of the water now\n\nIn the prestigious 16th Arrondissement (district), some basements in residential buildings were slowly being inundated.\n\n\"There are six studios in the basement, and we've had to set up blocks outside to keep the windows from breaking and covering everything in water,\" one caretaker, Joao de Macedo, told AFP.\n\nInside the studios, tables and dressers have been lifted off the floor as water seeps through the walls, the agency says.\n\nOutside, a young woman said it was \"great to see ducks instead of cars\" in places.\n\nA health centre in the north-western suburbs, where 86 patients were receiving care, was evacuated on Friday.\n\nA number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have attracted the artist\n\nA mural by graffiti artist Banksy has appeared on a bridge in Hull.\n\nSpeculation about the artist's identity was rife after the work, on a disused river crossing, was spotted by passers-by on Thursday.\n\nThe stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text \"Draw the raised bridge!\"\n\nImages of the mural were shared on Banksy's official Instagram account on Friday.\n\nThe elusive street artist posted two photos of the permanently raised bridge, situated on Scott Street in the Wincolmlee area of the city.\n\nHundreds of fans responded, with some expressing surprise at the location and others speculating on the meaning of the work.\n\nA number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have inspired the decision.\n\nAnd many were quick to link the work to Brexit, after recent pieces which touched on the UK's impending departure from the European Union.\n\nLast May, Banksy unveiled a mural in Dover which dep", "PPL": 1.871747374534607, "PPL/lower": 0.9179576304986324, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005390977461217185, "Min-5%": 9.200531234928206, "Min-10%": 7.8574252783083445, "Min-20%": 6.250480113227677, "Min-30%": 5.120975601168332, "Min-40%": 4.285625979340747, "Min-50%": 3.6225784888831516, "Min-60%": 3.093200699101636}, {"text": "aged his ears in an airport after getting a headphone cable tangled on a doorknob, Mr Lappala told me.\n\nIt was inspired by the traditional fisherman's vest.\n\nThe laptop pocket is on the back of the coat, making it feel like a backpack\n\nScotte Vest claims to have sold more than 10 million garments so far, ranging from trench coats to shorts, all with varying tallies of pockets.\n\nIt is great for travellers, said Mr Lappala.

Saving Sally gained an entry into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\n\nThe annual festival serves as an outlet to better promote local talent in the Pinoy film industry. But the MMFF sadly still could not save Sally.\n\nThe humble film was not widely shown in local cinemas.\n\nThe Philippine skyline takes centre stage in this film, which features stunning artwork\n\nIts creators said the answer could lie in the nature of the domestic cinema industry.\n\nLargely unregulated, Philippine cinemas have built a notorious reputation for favouring commercial successes movies like Hollywood blockbusters and \"manufactured\" romance dramas.\n\n\"They pick the films that they think people will watch. So it is more of a perception that since ours is a small, non-studio film, no-one would want to watch it,\" explained Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra said \"demand\" was often a deciding factor before a film could be considered for screening.\n\n\"Theatre owners here think that local audiences will only watch films starring big-names and A-list stars, produced by major studios. Saving Sally has neither,\" she said.\n\n\"Because of this, many cinemas don't want to take the risk and would rather see how audiences responds to our movie first.\"\n\nSaving Sally earned a festival entry but was not widely screened in cinemas\n\nTo film critic Oggs Cruz, another problem with the film lay in its animation, the very thing that its makers fought so hard to create.\n\n\"While most Filipinos enjoy animated films, the animated aspect in Saving Sally doesn't favour its commercial ability,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It is an adjunct of the main characters and I don't think it has any effect in its marketability. Sadly it won't entice children or adults.\"\n\n\"A lot of Filipinos are proud of their heritage but ironically, they would rather watch the latest Star Wars movie than support local film festival entries.\n\n\"It's a losing situation for the film makers whose work will get pulled out for more commercially viable movies that will earn more money.\"\n\nThe show's creators turned to the power of social media and launched an online campaign to save Sally, calling on audiences to contact theatre owners demanding they screen the film.\n\n\"Let your voices be heard. Please help us make noise and reach out,\" read a Facebook post on the movie's official page which drew close to 50,000 reactions and was shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nThousands of curious Facebook users and fans began to show their support for the film by leaving comments and writing posts using the hashtags #ShowSavingSally and #ImSavingSally.\n\n\"It was worth the wait and our money.

Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades.\n\nThe government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become \"weak and stable\", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks.\n\nSo it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil.\n\nBut the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously.\n\nShe is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure.\n\nIn her reply, the PM said while the report had found his conduct to have been \"professional and proper\" in general, it was right that he had apologised for making Ms Maltby \"feel uncomfortable\".\n\nAddressing breaches of the ministerial code, she added: \"While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations made in the past few weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards that the public demands of ministers of the crown.\n\n\"It is therefore with deep regret that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Mitchell Marsh could not convert his fifty, bowled through the gate by a Rashid variation that went straight on, while Marcus Stoinis hit an entertaining 60, but England's attack did well to limit the hosts with a late flurry of wickets.\n\nThey set more than 300 with a four from the final ball, but that is no longer an imposing target in ODIs and England were confident rather than cowed by it.\n\nMaking his return after knee and heel injuries, Mark Wood set the tone for an assured England display with a vicious opening spell, finding the pace and bounce that the Test side sorely lacked during the Ashes defeat.\n\nThe fast bowler removed Warner with just his fifth delivery, getting one to lift sharply and loop up off the top corner edge of the bat, with Root completing a simple catch.\n\nThat brought imperious Australia captain Smith to the crease, but he could not find the rhythm of his stunning Ashes performances, making 23 before a thin inside edge through to Buttler off Rashid.\n\nRashid finished with expensive figures of 2-73, somewhat softened by the key wickets of Smith and Finch, while Moeen offered far greater control than during the Ashes series, ending with a fine 1-39.\n\nWhile Wood was excellent, Chris Woakes struggled for accuracy until a more promising third spell and Liam Plunkett was solid in taking 3-71, his figures affected by a couple of loose overs.\n\nIn fielding only five bowlers, England will be susceptible to conceding bigger totals if one particularly struggles, but their attack looks to have the variation needed on Australian pitches.\n\nMan of the match Jason Roy: \"It was incredibly special. I don't have too many words right now. It is a huge honour to be out there for England again and to get runs on the board.\n\nOn beating Alex Hales' record ODI score for England: \"He [Hales] wasn't too happy by the sounds of things. The first thing the boys said was about him being pretty disappointed.\"\n\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"I would have taken [Australia's total] at the start - 300 these days isn't that big a total to chase down. It wasn't a huge task. I have no doubt someone else would have put their hand up if Jason hadn't.\"\n\nAustralia captain Steve Smith: \"We left ourselves a bit short in the first innings. We lost wickets in the middle and it stopped us going as hard at the back end.\"\n\nBrandon Lewis became party chairman in last week's reshuffle\n\nConservative candidates will be suspended if they insult rivals, the new party chairman says.\n\nBrandon Lewis said a new code of conduct would require people standing for Parliament to \"behave responsibly and show respect\" to others.\n\nMr Lewis urged Labour to sign up to the same guidelines as he vowed to improve the Tories' digital campaigning operation.\n\nLabour's Jeremy Corbyn said respect should be \"the norm in public life\".\n\nAsked about previous remarks by his shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Mr Corbyn said: \"I would rather stick to where I disagree with somebody on their policies.\"\n\nIn 2015 Mr McDonnell described Conservative Esther McVey, who was last week made the new work and pensions secretary, as a \"stain of inhumanity\", and he has also been criticised for quoting someone talking about \"lynching\" her during a meeting in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It's important that we've got to engage through that medium.\"\n\nAppearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis also defended a Tory social media campaign that promoted a new ban on credit card surcharges.\n\nThe ban had actually come about as a result of EU legislation.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

the women's equivalent of the Tour de France.\n\nThe 2008 road race world champion added she had to take her own skin suit to the event in Italy after British Cycling had forgotten to organise one, having to then sew a Team Sky logo onto it at the behest of Brailsford.\n\n\"The facts are they did nothing for the women,\" said Cooke.\n\nAn independent review into the culture of British Cycling began after its former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.\n\nDespite being cleared of eight of the nine charges against him, the Australian was found guilty of using sexist language in October but denies any wrongdoing and said he would appeal the ruling.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nIn her written evidence, Cooke said she had \"no faith in the actions in support of investigations conducted by Ukad or the testing they conduct, both completed at significant expense to the public purse\".\n\nIn response, Ukad said: \"There should be no doubt about the determination of this organisation to protect clean sport; our staff passionately believe in protecting everyone's right to clean, fair and honest competition.\n\nRegarding Cooke's accusations of sexism, British Cycling said in a statement: \"There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, UK Sport has launched an independent review to investigate some of the issues raised by Cooke.\n\n\"UK Sport takes its responsibilities as an investor of public funds and a champion of equality in sport very seriously,\" said a spokesman.\n\n\"On matters raised relating to the governance of the national governing body, UK Sport and Sport England have recently published a new code for sports governance which raises the bar for the requirements around governance that all sports bodies who receive public funding will need to address and comply to.\"\n\nThae Yong-ho is one of the highest ranking North Koreans officials ever to defect.

About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America.\n\nThe wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild.\n\nIts natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas.\n\nResearch led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal.\n\n\"This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,\" said Dr Nicol\u00e1s G\u00e1lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the g\u00fci\u00f1a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss.\n\nThey say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the g\u00fci\u00f1a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat.\n\nThe wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile\n\nThis is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say.\n\nAnother threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens.\n\nQuestionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a g\u00fci\u00f1a over the last decade.\n\n\"This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,\" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent.\n\nThe research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology provides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat.\n\nThe approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Clive Lewis and Emma Dent-Coad - and a host of academics and campaigners had earlier signed an open letter to Theresa May urging the prime minster to reverse KPMG's appointment.\n\nThey said the appointment would \"only further fuel rumours of a deliberate cover-up and erode public trust.\"\n\nKPMG said its role on the inquiry as project management advisor was \"purely operational\" and that it had no role advising \"on the substance of the inquiry\".\n\n\"Whilst we are confident that no conflicts exist between our role advising the inquiry and our work for other clients, we recognise that strength of opinion about our role risks undermining confidence in the Inquiry,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nThe firm said it would waive its fees for the work undertaken to date.\n\nThe blaze on 14 June last year killed 71 people\n\nLast month, survivors and bereaved families warned the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry could become a whitewash unless a diverse panel was appointed to oversee proceedings.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick's appointment as the inquiry chairman has already been criticised by residents, who say he is an establishment figure.\n\nVictims groups were further angered when the retired Court of Appeal judge said he would not appoint a member of the Grenfell community to the panel, arguing it would \"risk undermining impartiality\".\n\nFewer women who suffer a heart attack would die if they were given the same treatments as men, according to researchers.\n\nThey analysed the outcomes of 180,368 Swedish patients who suffered a heart attack over a 10-year period.\n\nWomen were two times more likely to die from the most serious type of heart attack than men in the year after having one.\n\nResearcher believe it is due to differences in the care given.\n\nThe team from the University of Leeds and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden analysed data from Sweden's online cardiac registry.\n\nThey found women were on average less likely than men to receive the recommended treatments after a potentially fatal type of heart attack called a STEMI.\n\nThis is the most serious type of heart attack where the coronary artery is completely blocked by a blood clot and it requires urgent treatment.\n\nIn the study, women who had a STEMI were 34% less likely to receive procedures which clear blocked arteries, such as bypass surgery and stents.\n\nThey were also 24% less likely to be prescribed statin medication, which helps to prevent a second heart attack, and 16% less likely to be given aspirin, which helps to prevent blood clots.\n\nThis is despite guidelines suggesting all three treatments should be given to both genders.\n\nThe study found that when women did receive all the recommended treatments, the gap in mortality between the sexes decreased in almost all circumstances.\n\nRoughly 124,000 men and 70,000 women are hospitalised for heart attacks in the UK per year.\n\nCo-author of the study Prof Chris Gale, from the University of Leeds, said gender biases for heart disease occur in the UK too.\n\n\"There's misconception amongst the general public and healthcare professionals about what heart attack patients are like.\n\n\"Typically, when we think of a heart attack patient, we see a middle-aged man who is overweight, has diabetes and smokes.\n\n\"This is not always the case; heart attacks affect the wider spectrum of the population - including women.\"\n\nProf Gale said that from their very first point of contact with healthcare professionals, women are less likely to receive the same diagnostic tests, leading them to be 50% more likely to be initially misdiagnosed.\n\n\"That then feeds the whole pathway of care,\" he said. \"If you missed the first, earliest opportunity for care - you're much more likely to miss the next point of contact - and it all adds up cumulatively and leads to a greater mortality.\"\n\nThe study also found that women were more likely to suffer from other illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, but these did not fully account for the difference", "PPL": 1.8516051769256592, "PPL/lower": 0.9414508294917887, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005037010818622577, "Min-5%": 9.005362323686189, "Min-10%": 7.5579691681207395, "Min-20%": 5.89562728294242, "Min-30%": 4.863963225765414, "Min-40%": 4.11843349516829, "Min-50%": 3.5175377149735727, "Min-60%": 3.034620569563844}, {"text": "President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week.

President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr Turnbull said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.\n\n\n\nLast summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.\n\n\n\nThe pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office.

Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\"\n\n\n\nMr Trump tweeted that he had used \"tough\" language but not that specific term.

Her son David explains why he's backing the appeal and hopes to see his mother freed.\n\nSally's last words to David were supposed to be heartfelt but undramatic. \"You know I love you, don't you?\" she said, fixing his gaze through an open car door, as she dropped him off at work.\n\nA day earlier, she had killed her long-time husband, and father of David, in a frenzied hammer attack. But as he headed to his job, David knew nothing of Richard Challen's gruesome death.\n\nAfter that drop-off, she had planned to swiftly end her own life - jumping from the top floor of a nearby car park. When she realised the car park was closed, she pressed on regardless, driving to Beachy Head in East Sussex. There she planned to jump to her death off the chalky precipice.\n\nFrom the clifftop, Sally called her cousin to admit the killing. She repeated the admission to a suicide team and a chaplain, who had been called to help her.\n\nIt took them two hours to talk her down from the edge.\n\nShe was charged with her husband's murder, convicted and jailed for life.\n\nHowever, eight years on, lawyers acting for Sally Challen are hoping to make legal history, and David is working to help them. They hope to use a law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse, to secure her release.\n\nDavid Challen says his mother suffered years of abuse at the hands of his father\n\nJust as physical violence in a relationship has been recognised as a mitigating factor in a killing, her lawyers say her history of psychological abuse by Richard provides a defence of provocation.\n\nThe circumstances around the killing itself give a taste of the sort of coercive control Richard exerted over his wife.\n\nIn the wealthy suburban village of Claygate, Surrey, one wet Saturday morning in August 2010, Sally visited the house she had, until recently, shared with Richard, her husband of 31 years.\n\nHe lived there alone since she had walked out on the relationship the previous November, after discovering he had been visiting prostitutes.\n\nDavid and his elder brother James, who prefers to avoid media attention, say their father inflicted years of psychological abuse on their mother. Having left Richard, the sons were adamant their mother should stay away from him.\n\nHowever, unknown to them, she had secretly begun seeing Richard again, hoping to patch up their marriage.\n\nWhat actually happened in the family home that morning was far removed from reconciliation.\n\nOn this particular morning, she drove the short distance from her new home. In the car with her was a handbag and, stashed inside it, a hammer.\n\nRichard had wanted her to approve a post-nuptial agreement that would cut her rights to the \u00a31m family home and impose stringent conditions, such as not interrupting him and not talking to other people when they were together in restaurants.\n\nThere was no food in the house and Richard was hungry, so he asked her to go out and buy something for his lunch.\n\nAs she headed back from the shops, Sally suspected Richard had had an ulterior motive for getting her out of the house.

Bercow: I require no lessons or lectures on how to be Speaker\n\nJohn Bercow has been accused of \"unilaterally changing\" parliamentary rules in the wake of a row over a government Brexit defeat in Parliament.\n\nCritics of the Commons Speaker say he broke with precedent and ignored the advice of officials when he approved a vote on the PM's \"Plan B\" response, which ministers lost by 11 votes.\n\nMr Bercow said he had made an \"honest judgement\" in the interests of MPs.\n\nCommons leader Andrea Leadsom said his actions were \"extremely concerning\".\n\nBut Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the Speaker as \"a House of Commons champion\" - despite disagreeing with his decision - and said the amendment itself was \"completely irrelevant [and] unimportant\".\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Bercow remained defiant in the face of more criticism from Mrs Leadsom during business questions, as she again accused him of \"arbitrarily changing the rules\" for the amendment.\n\nThe Speaker told the Commons he required \"no lessons or lectures\" on how to do his job, and that he would carry on with his duties \"no matter how much abuse I get\".\n\nThere were angry scenes in the Commons on Wednesday when Mr Bercow agreed to allow a vote on an amendment to a government motion tabled by Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.\n\nThe vote was ultimately lost by the government, meaning ministers will have to come up with revised plans within three days, rather than the three weeks previously agreed in law, if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this interactive Did my MP vote For or Against Dominic Grieve's amendment?

Click here if you cannot see the look-up.\n\nMinisters argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with long-standing precedent in saying it was.\n\nMrs Leadsom was among MPs to challenge the basis of his ruling and ask for clarification in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nShe later told ITV's Peston programme that it had set \"a very damaging precedent\" for the conduct of business in the House and the passage of future legislation.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about the decision that was taken today,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"What happened today was that the Speaker, instead of being the guardian of the rules, decided to unilaterally change the rules... It doesn't just damage me, it damages all of Parliament.\"\n\nMrs Leadsom said Mr Bercow's future was a matter for him but asked if she was questioning his impartiality, she said she had the \"greatest regard\" for the office of Speaker.\n\nEarlier in the chamber, ex-minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Bercow had served nine years in the job but questions now had to be asked whether he remained a \"neutral referee of our affairs\".\n\nBut Mr Rees-Mogg said he was a \"great admirer\" of the Speaker, even though he believed the decision \"could make parliamentary business extraordinarily difficult\".\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I happen to think on this occasion Mr Speaker came to the wrong interpretation, but that doesn't mean I think he is not a fair speaker and a good speaker.\n\n\"I do think... that the speaker's interpretation was eccentric, but I don't think it is part of a plot or undermines his standing or any of", "PPL": 1.8901351690292358, "PPL/lower": 0.9061755098336449, "PPL/zlib": 0.000509745191216083, "Min-5%": 9.407870409535427, "Min-10%": 7.902920963717442, "Min-20%": 6.230680086210479, "Min-30%": 5.1318611291021785, "Min-40%": 4.295816839324233, "Min-50%": 3.639696928587827, "Min-60%": 3.1197495709510115}, {"text": ", however, with a tinge of regret despite an excellent, fully merited result that gives them real reason for optimism for the second leg at Anfield.\n\nKarius and the woodwork kept them at bay and they had many other opportunities to produce a scoreline reflecting their superiority.\n\nSouthampton could have slammed the door on Liverpool - instead it remains ajar.\n\nKarius has had to undergo a severe examination of his goalkeeping credentials and endure heavy public criticism in the early months of his Liverpool career.\n\nKlopp placed great faith in the 23-year-old German, signed from his former club Mainz in a \u00a34.75m deal this summer - eventually choosing him ahead of established first-choice Simon Mignolet.\n\nThe decision backfired and he was forced to drop Karius after two poor, error-strewn performances in the 4-3 loss at Bournemouth and the 2-2 home draw with West Ham.\n\nKlopp has never lost belief, however, choosing Karius as his cup keeper - and he was rewarded here with an outstanding display, especially with two excellent saves from Redmond.\n\nHe is responsible for Liverpool still being in this tie after a shocking display.\n\nWhat the managers said\n\n\"Liverpool had just the one chance all game.

Here Vicky Spratt, deputy editor of The Debrief, describes years of depression, anxiety and panic as she tried one version of the pill after another.\n\nI sat in the GP's office with my mum and told her that I'd been having my period for three weeks. She told me that the contraceptive pill might help. She warned that it wouldn't protect me from sexually transmitted infections and told me that if I had unprotected sex I could get cervical cancer, so I'd best use it wisely. She had to say that, though I was 14 and sex was very much not on the agenda.\n\nMy prescription was printed in reception. And then, a three-month supply of the combined pill was mine. Picking up the green foil-covered packets full of tiny yellow pills felt like a rite of passage - I was a woman now. In the plastic pockets was the sugar-coated distillation of feminism, of women's liberation, of medical innovation.\n\nThis is where it all began, 14 years ago. I then played what I call pill roulette for more than a decade, trying different brands with varying degrees of success and disaster. It was around this time that I also developed anxiety, depression and serious mood swings which, on and off, have affected me throughout my adult life.\n\nRelationships have ended and I had to take a year out from university - I thought that was just \"who I was\", a person ill-equipped for life, lacking self-confidence and unhappy. It wouldn't be until my early 20s, after graduating from university - when my mental health problems and behaviour could no longer be dismissed as those of a \"moody teenager\" - that I would seriously question whether it was linked to my use of the pill.\n\nOne day in the early hours, sitting at my laptop, unable to sleep because of a panic attack which had lasted overnight, I began to Google. I had started taking a new pill, a progestogen-only pill (POP) which had been prescribed because I was suffering from migraines, and the combined pill is not safe for people who suffer from migraines with aura.\n\nI tapped the name of the pill + depression/anxiety into the search engine and the internet did the rest. There it was: forum threads and blog posts from people who were experiencing the same symptoms as me.\n\nAt this point I had already seen my GP several times, following the sudden onset of debilitating panic attacks, which I had never experienced before. At no point had my contraceptive pill come up in conversation, despite the fact that the attacks had started when I switched to the new contraceptive. Instead, I was prescribed a high dose of beta blockers, used to treat anxiety, and it was recommended that I should undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\n\nI lived like this for somewhere between six and eight months - I can't tell you exactly because that year of my life is a blur, recorded by my mind in fast-forward because of the constant sense of urgency and impending doom that coursed through my veins.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Debrief carried out an investigation, surveying 1,022 readers, aged 18-30\n\nI wish, wholeheartedly, that I could look back on this and laugh. That's how all good stories end, isn't it? But there was then, and is now, nothing funny about what I went through. It was terrifying. I was scared. I didn't recognise myself, I didn't like myself and I couldn't live my life. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or whether it would ever end. I was not only anxious but lethargic, I felt completely useless. I blamed myself.\n\nAt the time, convinced that I had lost my mind and feeling as though I was having an out-of-body experience, I explained to my GP that \"I felt like someone else\", as though my brain \"had gone off and gone mouldy\".\n\n\"Do you think this could have anything to do with my new pill?\" I asked. I remember the look on her face, an attempt to look blank which barely concealed a desire to tell me I was ridiculous. I explained to her that I had felt awful on every single one of the six or seven pills I'd taken up until that point, with the exception of one high-oestrogen combined pill which made me feel like superwoman for a year, before it was taken away from me (partly because of the migraines and partly because of an increased risk of thromb", "PPL": 1.9407238960266113, "PPL/lower": 0.955428929052707, "PPL/zlib": 0.000527227355617118, "Min-5%": 9.003833602456485, "Min-10%": 7.689406327172821, "Min-20%": 6.139616810022182, "Min-30%": 5.102031350912411, "Min-40%": 4.336646855023204, "Min-50%": 3.715546889330751, "Min-60%": 3.1981886209804773}, {"text": "\"The civil service is very defensive on Brexit.

My impression is he believes he is there to work for the minister, for the prime minister. That comes through all of his interactions with them. It is not like an episode of Yes Prime Minister.\"\n\nMr Robbins, a low profile official who started his Whitehall career as a high flying Treasury official, wields immense influence in Whitehall. His proximity to the prime minister, from his perch in the cabinet office, means that he speaks with authority on her behalf in Whitehall, in Brussels and during visits to other EU capitals.\n\nSome Leave figures in government regard him with suspicion. Mr Robbins is understood to be aware of the criticisms and has worked hard to build up relations with the likes of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.\n\nMr Robbins was appointed as the prime minister's EU \"sherpa\" and as the founding permanent secretary of the new department for exiting the EU (DEXEU) in 2016.

The same measures were taken in Catholic churches across much of the UK during the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009.\n\nParishioners who think they may have flu have been asked to stay away from Mass.\n\nFr Martin Magill, of the St John's parish in Belfast, said he believed people would understand the need for the precautions.\n\n\"I think all of us are aware of the huge amount of pressure that our hospitals are under at this stage and so this idea of doing something that will make a difference,\" he said.\n\n\"It's precautionary more than anything else.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNorth America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly \"bomb cyclone\" that dumped snow as far south as Florida.\n\nIn parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night.\n\nIn Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia.\n\nThousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast.\n\nThe extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports.\n\nFour deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina.

We should not take what we have seen so far as a template for the future.\".\n\nIt comes as the Russian army conducted large scale military exercises last year on home soil, in Belarus and in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad - which is sandwiched between Nato members Poland and Lithuania.\n\nIt was one of Russia's biggest military exercises since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the UK's \u00a336bn annual defence budget meant the government was addressing the range of threats from \"a position of strength\".\n\nHowever, Labour shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said she was sure Gen Carter would have tried to make his case behind closed doors but had gone public as a \"last resort\".\n\nShe added that if voicing concerns over funding made the prime minister and the chancellor \"wake up\", it would have been worth \"making the fuss\".\n\nAdmiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said such warnings from a serving chief were unprecedented.\n\n\"For them to talk about the need for more resources, I haven't known that in my 52 years in the navy - I mean this is extraordinary,\" he said.\n\nThe reality is that Britain would never confront a threat like Russia on its own. That's why it is part of Nato.\n\nBut even as a key member of the alliance, the truth is that some of the UK's weapons are increasingly outdated.\n\nWhile Russia's been developing new Armata tanks, the Army's Challenger 2 hasn't been modernised for 20 years.\n\nMany have been mothballed as the UK focused on the counter-insurgency campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan. Britain's ground-based air defence systems are also becoming increasingly obsolete and no match for Russia.\n\nStill, the likelihood of any direct military confrontation with Russia seems extremely remote.\n\nTrue, the US National Defence Strategy recently highlighted the risks of a more assertive Russia and China.\n\nBut for now, the concern is more about those countries using cyber and misinformation to disrupt life in the West.\n\nGeneral Carter's intervention is more driven by fears of further deep cuts to the UK's armed forces. The Ministry of Defence has a black hole in its budget.\n\nIt is rare for a military chief to make such an obvious and public appeal for more cash.\n\nBut he's doing it under the orders of the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has sent his generals over the top to put pressure on the chancellor.\n\nRobert Hannigan, who stood down as director of the intelligence monitoring service GCHQ last year, said Russia was the single country that had \"kept me awake\" in recent years.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 5 live: \"They have always been very capable, but in the last two, three, four years they've become quite aggressive.\"\n\nGen Carter's speech comes as national security adviser Mark Sedwill conducts a review of the UK's security capabilities.\n\nAll three armed forces have been asked to put forward options for cuts as the Ministry of Defence looks at how it will control spending.\n\nThere are concerns within the forces that the review will prioritise counter-cyber attacks and terrorism, rather than major defence.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas\n\nNext has reported a sharp rise in online sales over the Christmas period, while trading at its stores declined.\n\nThe retailer said strong sales during the three weeks prior to Christmas and the October half-term holiday had made up for a \"disappointing\" November.\n\nIn a continuation of recent trends, online sales rose 15.2% between 28 October and 29 December from a year earlier, while store sales fell 9.2%.\n\nIn total, full-price sales at the retailer were up 1.5% over the period.\n\nThe retailer expects an annual profit of \u00a3723m, slightly lower than its previous forecast of \u00a3727m.\n\nIt blamed the lower forecast on strong sales of less profitable items such as beauty products and personalised gifts.\n\nThe company said it was particularly difficult to forecast how its business would perform this year, due to the uncertainty around the UK's upcoming departure from the European Union.\n\n\"People are maybe a little bit more cautious, given the uncertainties around Brexit. But I think that's as strong as you can put it,\" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit.\n\nAt the moment, Next assumes economic conditions this year will be the same as the second half of last year and expects store sales to fall 8.5% and online sales to be up 11%.\n\nNext shares rose more than 6% after its trading statement. That follows a near 20% fall in December when investors were rattled by a profit warning from online fashion retailer Asos.\n\n\"Next has delivered some Christmas cheer to the retail sector, but only because its online offering is doing so well. Numbers from the high street stores look pretty dire,\" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nHowever, he points out that stores still make an important contribution to Next as half of online sales are picked up in shops.\n\nPredictions of a Christmas nightmare for retailers appear to have been wide of the mark - at least judging by the trading update from Next, traditionally the first of the big players to confess how they did at Christmas.\n\nSales in the three weeks before Christmas were strong, and there was a big shift from High Street to online sales.\n\nNext, thanks in part to long experience with its directories, has always led the High Street pack when it comes to online sales, and it is well placed to benefit from the move to the internet.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether next week's Christmas trading numbers - especially those from Debenhams and Marks & Spencer - elicit the same positive response.\n\nDebenhams is seen as the weakest of the big High Street names, with its shares trading at historic lows, while Marks & Spencer is the middle of a wide-ranging restructuring that will see it shed staff and stores.\n\nThe update from Next follows strong Christmas trading figures from John Lewis Partnership, which reported an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets.\n\nAttention will now turn to rival retailers Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, which release trading statements next week.\n\n\"We think John Lewis and Next will have outperformed thanks to their strong online presence, so we still wouldn't rule out some bad news from Debenhams or M&S,\" said retail analyst Nick Bubb.\n\nFinding workers with the right skills is becoming increasingly difficult, according to the British Chambers of Commerce\n\nUK firms are being squeezed by labour shortages, rising prices and a slowdown in sales.\n\nMore companies than ever before are finding it hard to recruit staff according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).\n\nIt warned that higher costs meant more manufacturers were expecting to raise prices.\n\nThe proportion of services firms saying sales were improving had dropped to a two year low.\n\nFour fifths of employers in manufacturing, and almost as many in the service sector, reported difficulties in finding the right workers.\n\nDr Adam Marshall, Director General of the BCC, said these findings suggested the government should listen more closely to business when it came to drawing up its migration policies.\n\n\"Business concerns about the government's recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously - and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy,\" he said.\n\nThe BCC said that the lack of clarity over the process of leaving the European Union had led to stagnating growth and business confidence in the UK.\n\nSuren Thiru, Head of Economics at the BCC, said the UK economy was facing \"persistent Brexit uncertainty and rising cost pressures\".\n\nHe added that subdued household", "PPL": 1.3892847299575806, "PPL/lower": 0.9000365755351991, "PPL/zlib": 0.00044272935945110917, "Min-5%": 8.447659637413773, "Min-10%": 6.944364456569447, "Min-20%": 5.245134334400989, "Min-30%": 4.185418018494833, "Min-40%": 3.391843706879464, "Min-50%": 2.769683763901917, "Min-60%": 2.31536187544459}, {"text": "by police and Swat teams.\n\nDuring the investigation child pornography images had been found on Paddock's laptop computer, he added.\n\n\"This report is not going to answer every question or even answer the biggest question as to why he did what he did,\" the sheriff said.\n\nAfter the shooting, officers stormed the hotel room and found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

It's not for everyone, but I absolutely love my gestational carrier and this was the best experience I've ever had.\n\n\"Having a gestational carrier was so special for us and she made our dreams of expanding our family come true.\"\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced that her daughter was born at 12.47am on Monday and weighed 7lb 6oz.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit filed by Blac Chyna against Kim Kardashian West and mother Kris Jenner has been \"tentatively\" dropped, according to TMZ.\n\nBlac Chyna, who has a daughter with Kim's brother Rob, was suing the pair after claiming they stopped the second series of E! show Rob & Chyna from being commissioned.\n\nThe show documented the birth of their now one-year-old daughter Dream and was not renewed for another series.\n\nIn December, lawyers for Jenner and the Kardashians filed for a dismissal of the lawsuit against them, which a judge has granted because there was no contract for the show's renewal.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The consequence of those scenarios has encouraged sterling to rally despite the PM suffering the worst parliamentary result in a century,\" said Jeremy Stretch of CIBC Capital Markets.\n\nOn Friday, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a major donor to the Brexit campaign, said he now expected the project to be abandoned altogether and that he is positioning for the pound to strengthen.\n\nThe markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise.\n\nBut more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down.\n\nSo what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely.\n\nThe other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds.\n\nReal businesses are not so sure. With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent.\n\nBut others are concerned the rejection of Mrs May's plan makes a no-deal Brexit more likely as other options become fewer in number.\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit means the public will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium.\n\n\"British businesses desperately need certainty about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal.

It can include measures such as curfews and travel restrictions.\n\nThe UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. If a hard border comes about, people and goods passing between Ireland and the UK will need to be checked.\n\nMeanwhile, a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian claims that the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, has told Mrs May that to revisit the backstop issue she would need to agree a permanent customs union with the EU.\n\nA customs union would mean that no tariffs would be put on goods travelling between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, but that the UK could not negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries.\n\nThe comments come ahead of a crunch week in Parliament.\n\nMrs May will return to the Commons on Tuesday for a vote on her deal, which includes the withdrawal agreement - the so-called \"divorce deal\" on how the UK leaves the EU - and the political declaration - a statement on the future relationship.\n\nIt was voted down by 432 to 202 votes last week, with hard-line Brexiteers in her own party and members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - on whom Mrs May relies for votes in Parliament - citing the backstop as their main reason for voting against it.\n\nA number of MPs have been tabling amendments in a bid to force the government to change direction.\n\nOne amendment, put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper, seeks to introduce a bill that would allow the government to extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU - by up to nine months in order to get a deal agreed in Westminster.\n\nYvette Cooper has the support of a number of MPs, including Conservative Remainers\n\nAlso appearing on Andrew Marr, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to \"block Brexit\" and said the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be.\n\nShe appealed for the support of the prime minister and MPs, as well as for the backing of her own party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: \"We can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out.\"\n\n\"We can't carry on with a kind of game of chicken,\" she said.\n\n\"In the end, someone has to take some responsibility and say, 'if the prime minister runs out of time, she may need some more time'.\n\n\"That is not about blocking Brexit, that is about being responsible and making sure you can get a Brexit deal.\"\n\nEnter the word or phrase you are looking for\n\nThe UK is allowed to scrap Article 50 altogether - and halt Brexit - but to extend it, it would need the approval of the EU.\n\nMr Coveney said Ireland \"won't be an obstacle\" if the UK wanted to go down the route of extending Article 50, adding: \"Ireland wants to help in this process.\"\n\n\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next to each other,\" he said. \"We have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"\n\nBut Mr Hancock said delaying Brexit would not help solve the arguments between MPs.\n\n\"You can't just vote for delay,\" he said. \"You've got to vote positively for a deal\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It's as simple as that.\n\n\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines.\"\n\nThe former chief constable of the police in Northern Ireland (PSNI) echoed previous warnings that the return of a hard border between the two countries would become a target for dissident republicans.\n\nSpeaking to RTE, Sir Hugh Orde said there would be no way to avoid security patrols if the UK left without a deal, and security officers would be \"at risk\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

But Thomas and Matsuyama both showed they had not lost any of their increasingly impressive edge during the Christmas break.\n\nWorld number one Jason Day was taking his first, relatively rusty steps back into the competitive arena after three months off and headlined a field that included US Open champion Dustin Johnson and US PGA winner Jimmy Walker.\n\nTwo-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Ryder Cup hero Patrick Reed were also competing, yet Thomas and Matsuyama separated themselves from these elite chasers to maintain the impressive momentum they had built towards the end of 2016.\n\nWhile Thomas triumphed, his 24-year-old Japanese rival came second to continue an extraordinary run of form. In his past six tournaments Matsuyama has won four times and now been runner-up twice.\n\nThe only player to have beaten him in this sequence is Thomas, who also triumphed by three strokes when he successfully defended the CIMB Classic in Malaysia in October.\n\nMatsuyama's hot streak began a couple of weeks earlier with a fifth place at the Tour Championship. Since then, he has picked up two titles in Japan, as well as the WGC HSBC Champions crown in Shanghai and Tiger Woods' Hero World Challenge.\n\nLast Sunday, an eagle at the 14th in the final round in Kapalua piled pressure on Thomas, who then steadied himself after a double bogey at the 15th to claim his fourth professional victory.\n\n\"I think it's potentially floodgates opening,\" Spieth said of his 23-year-old compatriot's promise, after he finished three shots clear of Matsuyama.\n\n\"The guy hits it forever. He's got a really, really nifty short game. He manages the course well,\" Spieth added. \"It's awesome to see.\"\n\nThomas was unlucky to miss out on a wildcard debut in last year's US Ryder Cup team. The Kentucky youngster admits that he feared he was losing ground on contemporaries such as Spieth, who is already a Masters and US Open winner.\n\n\"I think it drove me a lot,\" Thomas said. \"I wasn't mad, but it was maybe a little frustrating sometimes seeing some friends and peers my age do well - not because I wasn't cheering for them, but because I feel like I was as good as them. It's just immature of me.\n\n\"I mean, the fact of the matter is, over the course of a long career, we're going to beat each other. That's just how it is.\n\n\"I think now, I feel so much more comfortable. I really do.

He will play the following week in Abu Dhabi and joins Tiger Woods in the field for February's Dubai Desert Classic.\n\nOff the course, the Tour as a whole has made an impressive start to 2017 by attracting Chinese money to bolster the French Open.\n\nPlayed at the end of June, the tournament will be known as the HNA Open de France and with a prize fund in excess of $7m (\u00a35.75m) becomes the eighth event in the elite Rolex Series.\n\nThe idea behind these big-money tournaments is to provide Europe's young stars with a viable alternative to the PGA Tour.\n\nIf they succeed in this objective it can only raise standards and, as Thomas and Matsuyama have just demonstrated, they are already sky-high on the other side of the pond.\n\nArtist Claudine O'Sullivan offers an alternative to the Tube\n\nCommuters and travellers in London have been hit by a Tube strike.\n\nMore than four million people could be affected, but some have taken to social media to see the lighter side.\n\nFrom The Daily Grindstone, there was just a hint of sarcasm about alternative routes, such as the bus, which no-one else would have thought of:\n\nEarlier, Clapham Junction rail station was evacuated, but commuters were appeased by a little light music, as tweeted by Alicia Harries:\n\nIt's not just commuters who were struggling.

We received 1,200 submissions in 24 hours,\" said Ms Rothman, citing contributions from Iran, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe site's mission statement is to \"increase the visibility of female illustrators, female illustrators of colour, LBTQ+, and other minority groups\".\n\nOn Monday, it is relaunching, backed by a new server and showcasing 700 new members, whose work organisers have collated within three weeks.\n\nThey also have more than 300 artists on the waiting list.\n\nMs MacNaughton and Ms Rothman, who are both successful illustrators, said they were motivated to create the project after noticing certain publications were dominated by male artists.\n\n\"We counted a certain magazine that often has illustrated covers, and noticed that in the past 55 covers, only four were by women,\" said Ms Rothman.\n\nSomething seemed to be amiss, considering that the arts field within education is often dominated by women.\n\nIn the UK, data from higher-education admissions service Ucas shows that in 2016 the number of women enrolled in design studies courses (including illustration) was more than double the number of men.\n\nSo, do the women behind Women Who Draw think sexism in the industry is an enduring problem?\n\n\"When I see who wins the awards, who are on the juries and who speaks at conferences, it is clear that there is a bias.

They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms.\n\n\"The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015],\" says journalist Anthony Berteaux. \"What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Japanese police practise martial arts every week and avoid using weapons whenever they can\n\nOverton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been \"to militarise the police\".\n\n\"If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals,\" he says.\n\nTo underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift.\n\nThe care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces.\n\nJournalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing.\n\n\"One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell,\" he says.\n\nThere is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. \"A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again,\" he explains.\n\nThere are a limited number of longstanding rifle owners in Japan - when they die their heirs must hand the rifles in\n\n\"People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace.\"\n\nIn fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters.\n\n\"It is unknown territory,\" says political science professor Koichi Nakano. \"Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?\"\n\nAccording to Iain Overton, the \"almost taboo level of rejection\" of guns in Japan means that the country is \"edging towards a perfect place\" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership.\n\nHenrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as \"a civil liberty\", and rejecting the idea of firearms as \"something you use to defend your property against others\".\n\nBut for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country.\n\n\"The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna,\" says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. \"But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find the BBC World Service on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFord insists it will have fully autonomous cars, without steering wheels or brake pedals, on the roads by 2021.\n\nThe firm plans to use them within an Uber-like ride-sharing service at first before considering putting them on sale.\n\nBut rival car-makers have suggested that deadline is too ambitious, as Rory Cellan Jones reports from the CES tech show in Las Vegas.\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nEd Sheeran describes \"driving at 90\" in his new song Castle on the Hill\n\nA new song by Ed Sheeran which features the lyrics \"driving at 90\" has prompted a safety warning by police.\n\nCastle on the Hill, released on Friday, has been described as a \"love song for Suffolk\".\n\nIn addition to describing the Framlingham area where he grew up, Sheeran sings \"driving at 90 down those country lanes\".\n\nSgt Chris Harris, from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing, responded by tweeting \"please slow down\".\n\nThe new singles are the first to be released since he announced in December 2015 that he would be taking a break from music \"to travel the world\".\n\nThey are taken from his forthcoming album, which is called \u00f7 (Divide).\n\nPolice respond to Sheeran's new song by urging drivers to slow down\n\nOn the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Sheeran said he wrote Shape of You with the singer Rihanna in mind.\n\nWhile in his homage to growing up in Suffolk, Castle on the Hill, he says he \"can't wait to go home\".\n\nSgt Harris said: \"Know you want to go home but please slow down on Suffolk roads.\"\n\nAnd warned to \"drive to arrive\".\n\nSheeran is not the first singer to reference excessive speed in his lyrics.\n\nIn Crosstown Traffic, Jimi Hendrix sang \"ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive\".\n\nThe BBC has approached Sheeran's representatives for a comment.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nNewcastle produced a superb late comeback at Kingston Park to stun Bath and condemn the visitors to their third straight Premiership defeat.\n\nThe Falcons trailed 22-10 in the final 10 minutes, but forwards Mark Wilson and Ben Harris both bundled over after relentless pressure.\n\nSecond-half tries from George Ford and two from Semesa Rokoduguni built a lead for Bath before the late drama.\n\nThe much-improved Falcons have now won six Premiership matches this season, one more than the whole of last campaign, and move up to sixth, while Bath stay fourth.\n\nBath looked edgy once again following back-to-back league defeats against fellow play-off chasers Exeter and leaders Wasps.\n\nA torrid first half started with Fiji wing Goneva being given too much space to race in under the posts, followed by England fly-half Ford missing two relatively simple penalties.\n\nFord, who failed to land another crucial penalty and conversion after the break, did start a clinical first 20 minutes of the second half when he strolled in to score as Bath were camped in front of the try-line.\n\nWing Rokoduguni produced two pieces of individual brilliance to help stretch Bath's lead to 12 points - first dotting down while being tackled by Goneva and then showing his pace after latching onto the returning Anthony Watson's pass.\n\nBut the visitors could not hold onto the advantage as big flanker Wilson was pushed over and replacement prop Harris touched down in almost identical circumstances, with Joel Hodgson coolly converting both.\n\nNewcastle director of rugby Dean Richards: \"The boys had belief and really stuck at it.\n\n\"We went 12 points down and just went for it.

Many readers also described similar encounters on public transport and elsewhere. Here is a selection of their comments.\n\nI was travelling home from London to Newcastle with two children on a busy train. There was one man at a table with three empty seats. I realised he was sitting next to a conspicuous stack of porno mags and leafing through them. Everyone in the corridor had chosen to stand apart from him. \"Mummy!\" - my four-year-old daughter exclaimed loudly as she swung into the empty seat - \"that man has got pictures of ladies with big boobies!\". The porno man looked at her, looked at them, and crumpled. He put his mags in a bag and freed up the space next to him so that we could sit down. Hellen, Newcastle\n\nWhilst on a flight from Germany to Hong Kong a man in the next seat started up his laptop and was oblivious to the fact that his hardcore porn could be seen and heard by me and people in the next aisle. As a woman travelling on my own on an overnight flight, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I raised it with the purser - the man was moved and spoken to, apparently. As for the countless times I've witnessed this on the train, there's been no hope of anyone in authority sorting it out. You either have to move seats, say something and risk being verbally attacked, or seethe quietly until your stop. I'm not anti-men, anti-sex or anti-porn. Yet whenever I've raised this issue in the past, there's always someone ready to call me out for being a prude. I'm not. I just don't think porn has a place on public transport, or in any areas frequented by the general public. Annie G, UK\n\nI admit I've viewed online porn occasionally in the privacy of my own home, but even I was surprised and felt a little uncomfortable when the person on the next train seat began viewing very hardcore porn on his tablet. I ended up moving and informed the guard. He said he would \"have a word\" with the guy, and duly did, at which point the perpetrator (no doubt embarrassed) got up and moved. The guard apologised to me, then explained that this was an increasing problem. Lawrie, Sleaford\n\nThis happened to me on a train to London. I was shocked and offended. The man was watching porn video involving a yoga instructor, on his phone in the seat beside me. I decided to ask the man to stop watching the video because, like the man, I have free will and I could ask him to stop doing something I was uncomfortable with. Of course, he could refuse and I was prepared for that. As it happens, he obliged and actually apologised. It is not the law's role to protect people from offence. If we disagree with views, we must challenge these views and have an open debate, for that is the only way society can progress. Mel Lane, Guildford\n\nl was on a bus in Huddersfield working with a looked after child who was 14 years old at the time. My young person tapped me and pointed out the man sitting in front of us was watching \"disturbing stuff\". He was watching hardcore porn on a large screen. I quietly approached the man and asked him to either sit at the back or please turn it off, otherwise I would have to have very loud words with the driver. He looked horrified when l told him that a 14-year-old had pointed out what he was watching to me. He didn't say anything, he just turned his phone off and shoved it in his pocket. I still told the driver quietly when l was getting off. I left him having a word with him. I felt l had to say something as a professional, responsible adult and a mother. Annabel, Bradford\n\nWhen I was 14, I was on a plane with my dad. I had the middle seat and an unknown man was in the window seat with his computer. He was reading a lot of documents and then started watching porn. I was so shocked and then I got scared, like who does that in a plane? I've never told anyone about this, but I haven't forgotten it somehow. Lais, Brazil\n\nI went to McDonald's one evening with my wife and children. I sat at a large table while my wife and children went to the counter. A group of children aged between 12 and 14 were watching porn on a large iPhone with the sound on. I asked them to switch it off and received a cold shoulder. I insisted since I had young children or I would report them to the manager. Happily they switched it off before my children came. Paul Brown, Glasgow\n\nI was at an upmarket bar/restaurant having a meal with friends. At a table close by a man sitting on his own had his laptop out. I glanced at the screen and the man was searching porn websites full of pornographic explicit images of women. I was rather shocked, particularly as he was making no attempt to be discreet. It felt to me like a blatant case of sexual harassment to myself and my female friend. The waitress agreed to talk to him and he dimmed the screen. I said I would only be happy if it was turned off or we would leave. She went back to him and he closed his laptop and left. In my view a man wouldn't be able to expose himself in a restaurant so why should he be able to expose degrading images on his laptop?

VIDEO: From disgust to it's ok, Woman's Hour took to the streets to find out what you think of watching porn on buses\n\nI was standing on a packed tube train and a man was standing watching a porn movie on his phone. A boy, around 12 years old, realised what the man was watching and moved away. I tapped the man on the shoulder and very loudly asked why he was watching porn in a public place with children around? All he could reply with was \"you shut up\" and [swore at me]. I told him loudly to stop watching porn and switch it off but he refused. He said it was his personal right. Only my 16-year-old daughter supported me and told him to stop. Nobody else joined in or tried to help me. His behaviour was very threatening. I wanted to take his photo but was worried about his reaction.

The idea was to make globalisation and capitalism work for the world's poorest people.\n\nAfter a very slow start, the business today has more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) of funds on its books. It currently invests in 16 companies across 22 countries in Africa and Asia that have a combined 100,000 employees and serve 91 million people.\n\nThe son of anti-apartheid campaigners and brought up on a farm outside of Johannesburg, Andy doesn't seem qualified to run a global investment firm on first glance at his CV.\n\nHe has no business qualifications and instead studied philosophy at university, before going on to lecture in the subject.\n\nLeapfrog typically invests in insurance and healthcare firms across Africa and Asia\n\nYet he started investing in the stock market aged 10, using money he made from selling the family's crops on the side of the road. By aged 13, he was making money for clients.\n\nAfter attending the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Andy went to Cambridge University. It was while at Cambridge that Andy spent a summer working for a non-government organisation in India, which he said was \"one of his most formative experiences\" and is the genesis of his future idea for Leapfrog.\n\n\"We were trying to get Indian farmers to adopt drip irrigation, which could triple their production and lift them out of poverty,\" says Andy, now 41.\n\n\"But they just wouldn't do it. At the time, I thought they were being so irrational, but they weren't - they weren't prepared to take the risk of doing something new and seeing their crops fail as a result. Why? Because this would have meant that their children starved.\n\n\"So I thought, why don't we give these people a safety net to enable them to take a chance on bettering themselves, such as insurance cover.\"\n\nAfter spending his 20s lecturing and heading up an organisation that supports social entrepreneurs, Andy started work on Leapfrog. Initially, he got nowhere fast, because, he says, the idea was so new.\n\nMost Leapfrog firms, such as insurer Bima, utilise mobile technology\n\nHe says: \"It seemed close to impossible to begin with, but I just believed so fundamentally in the idea, which I call profit with purpose, of investing in companies that serve the other half of humanity - the four billion people that conventionally have not been served.\"\n\nWith no money coming in, Andy had to live off his and his wife's savings until Leapfrog got its first small investment after a year and a half.\n\nThe Clinton connection then followed, thanks to Andy knowing someone who worked for the organisation.\n\nHowever, the president's September 2008 speech failed to immediately open the investment floodgates, because it was quickly overshadowed by global events.\n\nA week later, investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the world was plunged into the global financial crisis.\n\nYet despite this backdrop, Leapfrog was able to secure $135m of investment by late 2009. Today its institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Axa, JP Morgan, AIG, Swiss Re and the European Investment Bank.\n\nCompanies that Leapfrog invests in and helps run include All Life, a South African insurance firm that gives low cost cover to people with HIV, Kenyan pharmacy chain Goodlife, and India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers. Andy says that Leapfrog helps the firms see revenues grow by an average 43% per year.\n\nRobert van Zwieten, president of Emerging Market Private Equity Association, the trade group for firms that invest in the developing world, says that Andy and Leapfrog have been \"trailblazers\" in helping to create a new industry known as \"impact investing\". These are firms that invest both to make money and to achieve a positive social impact.\n\nHe adds: \"The annual World Economic Forum (WEF) event at Davos has for several years been struggling to work out how to make globalisation and capitalism work for the many and not just the few, but Andy and his team at Leapfrog are already doing just that.\"\n\nNow based in Sydney, Australia, after previously being in New York, Andy says: \"You can do more good if you are profitable, and make more profit because you are good [doing virtuous things].\"\n\nFollow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter @WillSmale1\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nT2 stars Kelly Macdonald and Ewan McGregor at the Edinburgh premiere\n\nThe cast of the Trainspotting sequel have gathered in Edinburgh for the film's world premiere.\n\nOriginal cast members Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner all feature in T2 Trainspotting.\n\nThe sequel has been made 21 years after the first film, which followed the lives of a group of heroin addicts.\n\nThe original was based on a novel by Irvine Welsh, and the sequel is based on his book Porno.\n\nEwen Bremner is back as Spud in T2 Trainspotting\n\nThe new film sees the central characters in the present day, now middle-aged.\n\nEwan McGregor and Kelly Macdonald were among the stars at the premiere at Cineworld in Edinburgh's Fountain Park.\n\nMcGregor described how his initial reservations about making a sequel were soon dispelled.\n\nHe said: \"I think we were all a little nervous about making a sequel to Trainspotting and not pulling it off, damaging the reputation or leaving a stale taste in people's mouths about the original film.\n\n\"But we only felt like that until we read John Hodge's script.\n\n\"We all feel like these are people we know - Renton and Spud and Begbie.

But even in this unpromising landscape, defiance takes root in unlikely corners.\n\nWe were in the private dining room of a showy restaurant and the boss was already slurring his words. A large man with a level gaze, he'd finished one bottle of fine French wine and was moving on to a second.\n\nAs he lit a cigarette, two glasses went over like nine pins, one splashing red wine across the table and the other smashing on to the floor.\n\nIf influential people join the fight for legal rights - in between trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming\n\nBut he barely seemed to notice and went on telling me how he'd loved London's casinos when he stopped off on the way back from visiting his daughter's British boarding school.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, when across the dishes stacked with roast duck and dumplings, this local Mr Big suddenly thrust at me a brown file full of well-thumbed papers.\n\n\"Fifteen years I've been fighting this miscarriage of justice,\" he declared. A handbrake turn from talk of boarding schools and casinos.\n\nHe told me he'd got embroiled in a factional power battle. One local Communist Party boss wanted him to dish the dirt on a rival.\n\nNine members of his family had been detained and interrogated and when he wouldn't sign statements incriminating the political target, he himself was jailed on charges of tax evasion.\n\nEven worse, a cousin had died mysteriously in police custody. By the time he'd got to the end of this grimly familiar story of crime and injustice, the second bottle of red wine was empty and we'd long run out of things to toast.\n\nNow I don't usually see it as my job to deliver unpalatable truths to provincial restaurant bosses. The private dining rooms of China have seen more coldblooded politics than I will ever conceive.\n\nBut I had eaten his dinner and the least I could do in return was point out that he would not win his battle for justice and instead would waste a lot of money and a lot of political capital in the process of losing.\n\n\"I don't care about the money!\" he replied. \"The innocent must never give up on justice. I'll campaign for this wrong to be righted till the day I die.\"\n\nWell that brought me up short. I'm not used to private citizens standing on principle in China, especially not rich people. After all, this is a huge, homogenising society under an authoritarian one-party state.\n\nPrinciples often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury. Yes, Communist Party leaders make speeches about principles, but for the public that's even more reason to regard such talk as arrant hypocrisy.\n\nI'd even go so far as to say that many Chinese people today are actively intolerant or suspicious of those who stand up for values.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw may have written, \"the reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man\".\n\nBut you don't hear people quoting that in China. Instead there are plenty of proverbs telling people to keep their heads down or they'll get them lopped off.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's unreasonable man is plain crazy in this worldview. Not someone heroic and brave, but a loser who will go down and probably take his family and friends with him.\n\nIt's not so surprising given that people with convictions are the enemy to a paranoid political class which regards alternative values as an existential challenge.\n\nBut at this dining table I was now rethinking my assumptions about the people standing up to the system and shrugging off the crazy tag.\n\nI'd recently met a renegade bishop who was defying both the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAnd when I noted that many Roman Catholics were calling him crazy, he observed that people had called Jesus Christ crazy too.\n\nI'd observed brave human rights lawyers standing up for imprisoned colleagues. And young politicians in Hong Kong resisting Beijing's surreal version of democracy.\n\nBut the story that made me stop and think was this one among the wine stains and the scallops sprinkled with cigarette ash\u2026 a well-fed restaurant boss with so much to lose from upsetting local party bosses determined to join the ranks of George Bernard Shaw's unreasonable men and women.\n\nIf people like this join the fight for legal rights - in between their trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming.\n\nThe past 12 months have marked another restive year for the Middle East, with wars raging, populations suffering and militancy on the rampage. Here the BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, highlights five issues which helped shaped the region in 2016.\n\nSome hoped that 2016 would be the beginning of the end for the jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS). That might become one of the stories of 2017. But those who predicted that IS would fall easily were optimistic.\n\nThe Iraqi government offensive to re-capture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, has stalled. In house-to-house fighting, the Golden Brigade, which was trained by the US military, has suffered a 50% casualty rate, according to the Americans, though this figure is denied by Iraqi military personnel in Baghdad.\n\nThe Golden Brigade is part of the Iraqi government's elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has been bearing the brunt of the fight against IS.\n\nIn early December combat operations in Mosul were slowed down, because the level of casualties meant that the CTS risked running out of trained men.\n\nThe Iraqi Security Forces have said they will concentrate more on artillery and air operations but that will kill more civilians, which could play into the hands of IS.\n\nBy the end of the year the battle for Aleppo had been won decisively by a coalition made up of the Syrian state, Russia, Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and a variety of other militias.\n\nIt did not mean the end of the war but it was another sign that the war in Syria was entering a new phase.\n\nMore than ever, it was much more than a fight between the government and those who wanted to destroy it.\n\nIncreasingly the war is dominated by the agendas of the major powers that have intervened in the Syrian war. One example that affected matters in Aleppo was Turkey's decision to make a priority of its fight with the Kurds.\n\nThat meant it needed better relations with the Russians, which meant looking away in Aleppo as Russia led the charge against its erstwhile clients, in return for Russian acquiescence in Turkey's actions in northern Syria.\n\nIn 2017, unless the new ceasefire holds and gives way to meaningful peace talks, more Syrians will die and the war will continue to export crisis, violence and uncertainty.\n\nYears of war, corruption and under-development weakened Yemen before the war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition pushed it into catastrophe.\n\nFigures are not precise but one estimate is that 10,000 have been killed in the war and 37,000 wounded. Many are civilians.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, 19 million people in Yemen need urgent assistance. More than half the population has no healthcare.\n\nLarge numbers of Yemenis have been displaced by the war and are destitute.\n\nEvery war is brutal but the one in Yemen also features the grotesque sight of the region's wealthiest countries bombing the poorest, helped by the US and Britain who sell vast amounts of weaponry to the Saudis and other coalition allies.\n\nDespite all that firepower, the Saud", "PPL": 2.2095301151275635, "PPL/lower": 0.9849852955399837, "PPL/zlib": 0.0005773530481127681, "Min-5%": 9.7289306603226, "Min-10%": 8.399642603070129, "Min-20%": 6.821374611050109, "Min-30%": 5.731207780806948, "Min-40%": 4.893959299276394, "Min-50%": 4.198842026387958, "Min-60%": 3.61890488654278}, {"text": "sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban.\n\nThe executive order titled \"protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States\" was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March.\n\nThe order's new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system.\n\nImmediate impact: Soon after the order was signed, it was once again blocked by a federal judge, this time in Hawaii.\n\nSurrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers, Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama.\n\nThe 2015 regulation - known as the Waters of the United States rule - gave authority to the federal government over small waterways, including wetlands, headwaters and small ponds.\n\nThe rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources, which the president described as \"puddles\" in his signing remarks.\n\nOpponents of Mr Obama's rule, including industry leaders, condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington.\n\nScott Pruitt, Mr Trump's pick to lead the EPA, will now begin the task of rewriting the rule, and a new draft is not expected for several years.\n\nImmediate impact: The EPA has been ordered to rewrite, or even repeal the rule, but first it must be reviewed. Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obama's rule was announced, so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen. Instead the EPA must re-evaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act.\n\nA bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an \"attack on coal miners\".\n\nThe US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests.\n\nAn attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses.\n\nDescribed as a \"two-out, one-in\" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney.\n\nSome categories of regulation will be exempt from the \"two-out, one-in\" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and \"any other category of regulations exempted by the Director\".\n\nImmediate impact: Wait and see.\n\nProbably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said.\n\nThe effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US.\n\nImmediate impact: Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure.\n\nA fence is already in place along much of the US-Mexico border\n\nOn Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority.\n\nHe pledged repeatedly at rallies to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, saying it would be \"big, beautiful, and powerful\".\n\nNow he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise.\n\nOne order declares that the US will create \"a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier\".\n\nThe second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.\n\nImmediate impact: The Department of Homeland Security has a \"small\" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans.\n\nThe department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.\n\nThey argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen...\n\nOn his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access.\n\nMr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement.\n\nKeystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change.\n\nThe second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site.\n\nImmediate impact: Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, to move forward with the controversial pipeline. As a result, TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for $15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement. Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraska's Public Service Commission.\n\nThe Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil.\n\nIn one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system.\n\nThe order states that agencies must \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers.\n\nAlthough the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible.\n\nImmediate impact: Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation. That means Mr Trump's executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare.\n\nAbortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trump's presidency one day after his inauguration\n\nWhat's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from \"providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country\", even if they do so with other funding.\n\nThe ban, derided as a \"global gag rule\" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back.\n\nAnti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them.\n\nImmediate impact: The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants.

I've really missed it the last six months or so,\" he said.\n\nThis heartfelt and poignant post from Murray is the first time he has publicly voiced the anxiety that many others have felt for him and for his future in the game.\n\nHe will have approached this period of rehabilitation as meticulously, thoroughly and professionally as everything else in his career. And now - as he approaches six months away from the match court - he has discovered all too painfully that it has so far not been sufficient.\n\nMurray is still very reluctant to opt for surgery, but he may come to the conclusion over the next few days that he has little alternative.\n\nMurray has never addressed the precise nature of his hip problem. There is not one accepted diagnosis, but a very good source has told me Murray has a torn labrum. Any surgery would therefore be fraught with uncertainty and my understanding is that even if successful, the repair can sometimes have a limited shelf life.\n\nEvery condition is of course different, but Lleyton Hewitt had surgery on both hips for similar reasons in 2008 and 2010. He was never quite the same player again but still won three ATP titles after going under the knife for a second time.\n\nMurray's other concern with surgery will be his extended absence from the sport. By July, he will have been missing for a whole year. However great a player, it is hugely challenging to rediscover that competitive edge after such a long break from the tour.\n\nJon Flanagan admitted assault when he appeared before magistrates\n\nLiverpool footballer Jon Flanagan has pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend.\n\nThe 25-year-old defender appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday accused of kicking Rachael Wall.\n\nHe was charged following an incident at 03:20 GMT in Duke Street, in Liverpool city centre, on 22 December.
