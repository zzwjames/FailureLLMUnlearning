["for a moment. \n'Yes, sir.' \n'Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutes' time.' \nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby-red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do. \nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. 'What does Dumbledore want?' Hermione said at once. 'Harry, are you OK?' she added anxiously. \n'I'm fine,' said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder's Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned. \n'I haven't got much time,' Harry panted, 'Dumbledore thinks I'm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen ...' \nQuickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermione's gasps of horror or for Ron's hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later. \n'... so you see what this means?' Harry finished at a gallop. 'Dumbledore won't be here tonight, so Malfoy's going to have another clear shot at whatever he's up to. No, listen to me!\" he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. 'I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -' He shoved the Marauder's Map into Hermione's hand. 'You've got to watch him and you've got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he's put extra protection in the school, but if Snape's involved, he'll know what Dumbledore's protection is, and how to avoid it - but he won't be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?' \n'Harry -' began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear. \n' ? haven't got time to argue,' said Harry curtly. Take this as well -' He thrust the socks into Ron's hands. \n\u2018Thanks,' said Ron. 'Er - why do I need socks?' \n'You need what's wrapped in them, it's the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. I'd better go, Dumbledore's waiting -' \n'No!' said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. 'We don't want it, you take it, who knows what you're going to be facing?' \n'I'Il be fine, I'll be with Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'I want to know you lot are OK ... don't look like that, Hermione, I'll see you later \nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall. \nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side. \n'I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,' said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, 'Very good. Shall we go?' \nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still pant-ing and sweating rather a lot. \n'But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?' Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape. \nThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,' said Dumbledore lightly. 'I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog's Head ... or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one's true destination.' \nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering twi-light. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid's cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening. \n'Professor,' said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, 'will we be Apparating?' \n'Yes,' said Dumbledore. 'You can Apparate now, I believe?' \n'Yes,' said Harry, 'but I haven't got a licence.' \nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go? \n'No matter,' said Dumbledore, 'I can assist you again.' \nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting. \n'- and stay out!' shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. 'Oh, hello, Albus ... you're out late ...' \n'Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening ... forgive me, I'm off to the Hog's Head ... no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight...' \nA minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog's Head's sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty. \n'It will not be necessary for us to enter,' muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. 'As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one ... two ... three ...'\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being com-pressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.\n\nChapter 26: The Cave\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. \n\"What do you think?\" asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry's opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic. \n\"They brought the kids from the orphanage here?\" asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip. \n\"Not here, precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don't you?\" \nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps. \n\"But his final destination \u2014 and ours \u2014 lies a little farther on. Come.\" \nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged", "y. \"It's got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.\" \n  \nHarry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously. \n  \n\"Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn't guarantee anything.\" \n  \n\"No?\" said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \"Perhaps this will make you more confident.\" \n  \nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened. \n  \n\"Tell anyone,\" said Maifoy, \"and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He's a family friend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention.\" \n  \n\"There will be no need for \u2014\" \n  \n\"I'll decide that,\" said Malfoy. \"Well, I'd better be off. And don't forget to keep that one safe, I'll need it.\" \n  \n\"Perhaps you'd like to take it now?\" \n  \n\"No, of course I wouldn't, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don't sell it.\" \n  \n\"Of course not. . . sir.\" \n  \nBorgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy. \n  \n\"Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?\" \n  \n\"Naturally, naturally,\" murmured Borgin, bowing again. \n  \nNext moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried. \n  \n\"What was that about?\" whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears. \n  \n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said 'that one'?\" \n  \n\"No, he was behind that cabinet \u2014\" \n  \n\"You two stay here,\" whispered Hermione. \n  \n\"What are you \u2014 ?\" \n  \nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry. \n  \n\"Hello, horrible morning, isn't it?\" Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display. \n  \n\"Is this necklace for sale?\" she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case. \n  \n\"If you've got one and a half thousand Galleons,\" said Mr. \n  \nBorgin coldly. \n  \n\"Oh \u2014 er \u2014 no, I haven't got quite that much,\" said Hermione, walking on. \"And . . . what about this lovely \u2014 um \u2014 skull?\" \n  \n\"Sixteen Galleons.\" \n  \n\"So it's for sale, then? It isn't being . . . kept for anyone?\" \n  \nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the \n  \nwinds. \n  \n\"The thing is, that \u2014 er \u2014 boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he's a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he's already reserved anything, I obviously don't want to get him the same thing, so ... um ...\" \n  \nIt was a pretty lame story in Harry's opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too. \n  \n\"Out,\" he said sharply. \"Get out!\" \n  \nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign. \n  \n\"Ah well,\" said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. \"Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious \u2014\" \n  \n\"Well, next time you can show me how it's done, Master of Mystery!\" she snapped. \n  \nRon and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys' \n  \nWizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly. \n  \n  \n\nChapter 7: The Slug Club\n\n\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy's behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy's face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy's activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.\n\"Yes, I've already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\" said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George's room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \"But haven't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?\"\n\"Maybe he's broken his Hand of Glory\" said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick's bent tail twigs. \"Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\"\n\"But what about when he said, 'Don't forget to keep that one safe'?\" asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \"That sounded to me like Borgin's got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\"\n\"You reckon?\" said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\n\"Yeah, I do,\" said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \"Malfoy's father's in Azkaban. Don't you think Malfoy\u2019d like revenge?\"\nRon looked up, blinking.\n\"Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\"\n\"That's my point, I don't know!\" said Harry, frustrated. \"But he's up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father's a Death Eater and ?quot;\nHarry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.\n\"Harry?\" said Hermione in an anxious voice. \"What's wrong?\"\n\"Your scar's not hurting again, is it?\" asked Ron nervously.\n\"He's a Death Eater,\" said Harry slowly. \"He's replaced his father as a Death Eater!\"\nThere was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \"Malfoy? He's sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?\"\n\"It seems very unlikely, Harry,\" said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. \"What makes you think ??\"\n\"In Madam Malkin's. She didn't touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He's been branded with the Dark Mark.\"\nRon and Hermione looked at each other.\n\"Well.. .\" said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.\n\"I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,\" said Hermione", "aking his head. 'Caved in or something.'\n    'Oh . . .' said Sirius, frowning. 'Well, I'll have a think and get back to - '\n    He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.\n    'Sirius?' said Harry anxiously.\n    But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n    'Why did he - ?'\n    Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n    A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.\n    The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys' dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge's hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.\n- CHAPTER EIGHTEEN -\nDumbledore's Army\n'Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There's no other explanation.'\n    'You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?' he said, outraged.\n    'I'm almost certain of it,' said Hermione grimly. 'Watch your frog, it's escaping.'\n    Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table - 'Accio!' - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.\n    Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.\n    'I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,' Hermione whispered. 'I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all - it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it - tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? Harry, you're squashing your frog.'\n    Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.\n    'It was a very, very close call last night,' said Hermione. 'I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silendo.'\n    The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.\n    'If she'd caught Snuffles - '\n    Harry finished the sentence for her.\n    ' - He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.' He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.\n    'Silencio!' said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry's frog, which deflated silently before them. 'Well, he mustn't do it again, that's all. I just don't know how we're going to let him know. We can't send him an owl.'\n    'I don't reckon he'll risk it again,' said Ron. 'He's not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio.'\n    The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.\n    'Silencio. SILENCIO!'\n    The raven cawed more loudly.\n    'It's the way you're moving your wand,' said Hermione, watching Ron critically, 'you don't want to wave it, it's more a sharp jab.'\n    'Ravens are harder than frogs,' said Ron through clenched teeth.\n    'Fine, let's swap,' said Hermione, seizing Ron's raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. 'Silencio!' The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.\n    'Very good, Miss Granger!' said Professor Flitwick's squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron and Hermione all jump. 'Now, let me see you try, Mr Weasley'\n    'Wha-? Oh - oh, right,' said Ron, very flustered. 'Er - silencio!'\n    He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye: the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk.\n    It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.\n    They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody's head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students.\n    'I've got permission!' she said. To re-form the Quidditch team!'\n    'Excellent!' said Ron and Harry together.\n    'Yeah,' said Angelina, beaming. 'I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore. Anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o'clock tonight, all right, because we've got to make up time. You realise we're only three weeks away from our first match?'\n    She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first-year instead, and vanished from sight.\n    Ron's smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.\n    'Hope this clears up. What's up with you, Hermione?'\n    She, too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.\n    'Just thinking . . .' she said, still frowning at the rain-washed window.\n    'About Siri - Snuffles?' said Harry.\n    'No . . . not exactly . . .\" said Hermione slowly. 'More . . . wondering . . . I suppose we're doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren't\n    Harry and Ron looked at each other.\n    'Well, that clears that up,' said Ron. 'It would've been really annoying if you hadn't explained yourself properly.'\n    Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there.\n    'I was just wondering,' she said, her voice stronger now, 'whether we're doing the right thing, starting this Defence Against the Dark Arts group.'\n    'What?' said Harry and Ron together.\n    'Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!' said Ron indignantly.\n    'I know,' said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. 'But after talking to Snuffles . . .'\n    'But he's all for it,' said Harry.\n    'Yes,' said Hermione, staring at the window again. 'Yes, that's what made me think maybe it wasn't a good idea after all . . .'\n    Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed.\n    'Let's get this straight,' said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, 'Sirius agrees with us, so you don't think we should do it any more?'\n    Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her own", "hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.\n    'I never remember my dreams,' said Ron, 'you say one.'\n    'You must remember one of them,' said Harry impatiently.\n    He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Proiessor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him.\n    'Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,' said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. 'What d'you reckon that means?'\n    'Probably that you're going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,' said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.\n    'D'you realise how much homework we've got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we've got a month's dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren't wrong about OWL year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .'\n    When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teachers desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.\n    The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.\n    'Well, good afternoon!' she said, when finally the whole class had sat down.\n    A few people mumbled 'good afternoon' in reply.\n    'Tut, tut,' said Professor Umbridge. 'That won't do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply \"Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge\". One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!'\n    'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,' they chanted back at her.\n    There, now,' said Professor Umbridge sweetly. That wasn't too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.'\n    Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order 'wands away' had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill, ink and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:\nDefence Against the Dark Arts\nA Return to Basic Principles\n'Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn't it?' stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your OWL year.\n    'You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.'\n    She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by the 'Course Aims'.\n1.\tUnderstanding the principles underlying defensive magic.\n2.\tLearning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally\nhe used\n3.\tPlacing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.\nFor a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge's three course aims she asked, 'Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?'\n    There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.\n    'I think we'll try that again,' said Professor Umbridge. 'When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply, \"Yes, Professor Umbridge\", or \"No, Professor Umbridge'. So: has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?'\n    'Yes, Professor Umbridge,' rang through the room.\n    'Good,' said Professor Umbridge. I should like you to turn to page five and read \"Chapter One, Basics for Beginners\". There will be no need to talk.'\n    Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher's desk, observing them all closely with those pouchy toad's eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.\n    It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.\n    Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her enquiringly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.\n    After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye rather than struggle on with 'Basics for Beginners'.\n    When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.\n    'Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?' she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.\n    'Not about the chapter, no,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, we're reading just now,' said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth. 'If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.'\n    'I've got a query about your course aims,' said Hermione.\n    Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.\n    'And your name is?'\n    'Hermione Granger,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully' said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.\n    'Well, I don't,' said Hermione bluntly. There's nothing written up there about using defensive spells.'\n    There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.\n    'Using defensive spells?' Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. 'Why, I can't imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren't expecting to be attacked during class?'\n    'We're not going to use magic?' Ron exclaimed loudly.\n    'Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr - ?'\n    'Weasley,' said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.\n    Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back or. him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge's pouchy eyes lingerec. on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.\n    'Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?'\n    'Yes,' said Hermione. 'Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practise defensive spells?'\n    'Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?' asked Professor Umbridge, in her falsely sweet voice.\n    'No, but - '\n    'Well then, I'm afraid you are not qualified to decide what the \"whole point\" of any class is. W", "were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it - '\n    'Enough, enough!' said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face. 'I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story - '\n    Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.\n    'We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,' he said, 'other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.'\n    Fudges plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, 'We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly - '\n    'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.\n    'True,' said Madam Bones. 'Perfectly true.'\n    'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge. 'Where is this person?'\n    'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore. 'She's just outside the door. Should I - ?'\n    'No - Weasley, you go,' Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.\n    A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.\n    Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.\n    'Full name?' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.\n    'Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice.\n    'And who exactly are you?' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice\n    'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg.\n    'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.'\n    'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs Figg. 'So you wouldn't have me registered, would you?'\n    'A Squib, eh?' said Fudge, eyeing her closely. 'We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors?' he added, looking left and right along the bench.\n    \"Yes, we can!' said Mrs Figg indignantly.\n    Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. 'Very well,' he said aloofly. 'What is your story?'\n    'I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,' gabbled Mrs Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, 'when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running - '\n    'Running?' said Madam Bones sharply. 'Dementors don't run, they glide.'\n    'That's what I meant to say,' said Mrs Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. 'Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.'\n    'What did they look like?' said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh.\n    'Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny - '\n    'No, no,' said Madam Bones impatiently. 'The Dementors . . . describe them.'\n    'Oh,' said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\n    Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . .\n    In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded.\n    'Big and wearing cloaks,' repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. 'I see. Anything else?'\n    'Yes,' said Mrs Figg. 'I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . .'\n    Her voice shook and died.\n    Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.\n    'What did the Dementors do?' she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.\n    They went for the boys,' said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. 'One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that . . . that is what happened,' Mrs Figg finished, somewhat lamely.\n    Madam Bones looked down at Mrs Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, That's what you saw, is it?'\n    That is what happened,' Mrs Figg repeated.\n    'Very well,' said Fudge. 'You may go.'\n    Mrs Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.\n    'Not a very convincing witness,' said Fudge loftily.\n    'Oh, I don't know,' said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. 'She certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't.'\n    'But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?' snorted Fudge. The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn't have bet - '\n    'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly.\n    The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shade w, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent.\n    'And what is that supposed to mean?' Fudge asked icily.\n    'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore.\n    'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!' barked Fudge.\n    'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.'\n    'Yes, you have,' said Fudge forcefully, 'and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The Dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to", "for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was\n28\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure\nthey didn't fail. He had a plan.\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\ntime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\n29\nHarry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\nI want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.\"\n\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.\"\n\"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\nback doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\nto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty\n30\nletters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\n\"Out! OUT!\"\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\"\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake'em off... shake 'em\noff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\nThey didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred\n31\nof these", "as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \n  \n\"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world \u2014 hidden \u2014 buried or invisible \u2014\" \n  \n\"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack \u2014 the piece that lives in his body.\" \n\"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \n\"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \n  \n\"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \n  \n\"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a ter-rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been \u2014 forgive me the lack of seemly modesty \u2014 for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-enth of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \n  \n\"But how did you find it?\" \n\"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunt\u2019s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \n\"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \n\"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \n  \n\"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \n  \n\"The diary wasn't that special.\" \n  \n\"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-pendous importance.\" \n  \n\"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \n  \n\"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have al-ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \n  \n\"The locket!\" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup!\" \n  \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet \u2014 perhaps not my other hand \u2014 but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" \n  \nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \n  \n\"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \n  \n\"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two \u2014 he may have found three \u2014 that is the best we can do for now.\" \n  \n\"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he\u2019s got both?\" \n  \n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?' \n  \n\"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \n  \n\"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \n  \n\"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \n  \n\"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \n  \n\"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" ", "he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to and he's never been late yet!\" \n  \nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga. \n  \n\"How do I look?\" said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. \n  \n\"Lovely, madam,\" squeaked Hokey. \n  \nHarry could only assume that it was down in Hokey\u2019s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. \n  \nA tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. \n  \n\"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey!\" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. \n  \nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. \n  \n\"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. \n  \n\"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have!\" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom. ... Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah ...\" \n  \nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. \n  \n\"Help yourself, Tom,\" said Hepzibah, \"I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. ...\" \n  \nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. .|,! \n  \n\"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?\" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. \n  \n\"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair \u2014\" \n  \n\"Now, now, not so fast, or I\u2019ll think you're only here for my trinkets!\" pouted Hepzibah. \n  \n\"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire \u2014\" \n  \n\"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.\" \n  \n\"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. \n  \n\"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. ... In fact, bring both, while you're at it. ...\" \n  \n\"Here, madam,\" squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools. \n  \n\"Now,\" said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, \"I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this!\" \n  \nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. \n  \n\"I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!\" whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah\u2019s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort's handsome features. \n\"A badger,\" murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \"Then this was . . . ?\" \n  \n\"Helga Hufflepuff 's, as you very well know, you clever boy!\" said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \"Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .\" \n  \nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away. \n  \n\"Now then,\" said Hepzibah happily, \"where\u2019s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are \u2014 take that away now, Hokey.\" \n  \nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. \n\"I think you'll like this even more, Tom,\" she whispered. \"Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. ...\" \n  \nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. \n  \nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \n  \n\"Slytherin's mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S. \n  \n\"That's right!\" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \"I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value \u2014\" \n  \nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain. \n  \n\"\u2014 I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . .", "is Mad-Eye?\" asked Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's retired, used to work at the Ministry,\" said Charlie. \"I met him once when Dad took me into work with him. He was an Auror - one of the best. . . a Dark wizard catcher,\" he added, seeing Harry's blank look \"Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though. . . the families of people he caught, mainly. . .\n\u3000\u3000and I heard he's been getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn't trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere.\"\n\u3000\u3000Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King's Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.\n\u3000\u3000\"I just can't justify taking more time off at the moment,\" he told them. \"Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, you know what, Percy?\" said George seriously. \"I reckon he'll know your name soon.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,\" Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. \"But there weren't any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they don't look happy, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster's Fabulous No-Heat, Wet-Start Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred's trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man's leg.\n\u3000\u3000The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King's Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\n\u3000\u3000Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it. . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.\n\u3000\u3000The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\n\u3000\u3000\"I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\" said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said Fred keenly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll see,\" said Charlie. \"Just don't tell Percy I mentioned it.. . it's 'classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,' after all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,\" said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why?\" said George impatiently.\n\u3000\u3000\"You're going to have an interesting year,\" said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \"I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"A bit of what?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh it was my pleasure, dears,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"I'd invite you for Christmas, but...well, I expect you're all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with. . . one thing and another.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum!\" said Ron irritably. \"What d'you three know that we don't?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll find out this evening, I expect,\" said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. \"It's going to be very exciting - mind you, I'm very glad they've changed the rules -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What rules?\" said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won't you? Won't you, Fred? And you, George?\"\n\u3000\u3000The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.\n\u3000\u3000\"Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts!\" Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. \"What rules are they changing?\"\n\u3000\u3000But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon's cage to muffle his hooting.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts,\" he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \"At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won't say. Wonder what --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore - the man's such a Mudblood-lover - and Durmstrang doesn't admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy's voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?\" she said angrily. \"I wish he had gone, then we wouldn't have to put up with him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Durmstrang's another wizarding school?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Hermione sniffily, \"and it's got a horrible reputation. According to An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I think I've heard of it,\" said Ron vaguely. \"Where is it? What country?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, nobody knows, do they?\" said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - why not?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,\"\n\u3000\u3000", "encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. \n\u201cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. \u201cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don\u2019t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven't even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\"\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way\nback to London than tell Snape why he was late.\n\u201cI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?\" Snape\ncontinued. \"And with no flying car available you decided that\nbursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to\ncreate a dramatic effect.\"\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might\nexplode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for\nthe few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without\nanyone else listening.\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, \"No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure.\"\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was ail a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, .mil forced his way in between them.\n\"Where've you \u2014 blimey, what've you done to your face?\" said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I\n\"Why, what's wrong with it?\" said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\n\"You're covered in blood!\" said Hermione. \"Come here \u2014\"\nShe raised her wand, said \"Tergeo!\" and siphoned off the dried blood.\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \"How's my nose looking?\n\u201cNormal,\" said Hermoine anxiously. \"Why shouldn't it? Harry, what happened? We've been terrified!\"\n\u201cI'll tell you later,\" said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.\n\u201cBut \u2014\" said Hermione.\n\u201cNot now, Hermione,\" said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn't reach too many Gryffindor ears.\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.\n\u201cYou missed the Sorting, anyway,\" said Hermione, as Ron dived a largt: chocolate gateau. \n\u201cHat say anything interesting?\" asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\n\u201cMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.\" \n\u201cDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?\" Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesn't he? It can't be long now.\" \n\u201cSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast \u2014\" \n\u201cYou've seen Snape? How come?\" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\n\"Bumped into him,\" said Harry evasively.\n\"Hagrid was only a few minutes late,\" said Hermione. \"Look, he's waving at you, Harry.\"\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid's other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry's parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Malfoy one-on-one...\n\"So what did Professor Slughorn want?\" Hermione asked.\n\"To know what really happened at the Ministry.\" said Harry.\n\"Him and everyone else here,\" sniffed Hermione. \"People were interrogating us about it on the train, weren't they, Ron?\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. \"All wanting to know if you really are 'the Chosen One' \u2014\"\n\"There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,\" interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. \"I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. 'Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,' I told them. 'I would rather die than betray his trust.'\" \n\u201cThat's nor saying much, seeing as you're already dead,\" Ron observed.\n\u201cOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\n\"The very best of evenings to you!\" he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room. \n\u201cWhat happened to his hand?\" gasped Hermione.\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore's right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.", "so special about her??/p> \n\"A lot of boys like her,\" said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \"Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!\n\"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\" said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.\n\"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or ?quot;\n\"I wouldn't bank on an invitation,\" said Zabini. \"He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old\nfriends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Dearh Eaters.\"\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.\n\"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.\" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \"I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?\"\n\"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?\" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.\n\"Well, you never know,\" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \"I might have ?er ?moved on to bigger and better things.\"\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded.\n\"Do you mean \u2014\u201c\nMalfoy shrugged.\n\"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. ... When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyone's got? Of course he isn't?It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\"\n\"And you think you'll be able to do something for him?\" asked\nZabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?\"\n\"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly.\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.\n\"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on.\"\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\n\"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something.\"\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?\n\"Petrificus Totalus!\"\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.\n\"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . .\"\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers.\n\"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here . . .\"\n-=-Him\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.\n\"That's from my father. Now, let's see. . . .\"\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him.\n\"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter ... or not.\"\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.\n\nChapter 8:  Victorious Snape\n\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the _ Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. \nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in... and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \"Accio W", "deten-tion again, leave it!\"\n\"Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,\" said Snape, smirking a little, \"and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.\"\n  \nRon was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron's Appari-tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys' bathroom with Harry. \n  \n\"Snape's right, though, isn't he?\" said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. \"I dunno whether it's worth me taking the test. I just can't get the hang of Apparition.\" \n  \n\"You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,\" said Harry reasonably. \"It'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you're still not \u2014 you know \u2014 as good as you'd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer \u2014 Myrtle, this is the boys' bathroom!\" \n  \nThe ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. \"Oh,\" she said glumly. \"It's you two.\" \n  \n\"Who were you expecting?\" said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.\n  \n\"Nobody,\" said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. \"He said he'd come back and see me, but then you said you'd pop in and visit me too\" \u2014 she gave Harry a reproachful look \u2014 \"and I haven't seen you for months and months. I've learned not to ex-pect too much from boys.\" \n  \n\"I thought you lived in that girls' bathroom?\" said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now. \n  \n\"I do,\" she said, with a sulky little shrug, \"but that doesn't mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?\" \n  \n\"Vividly,\" said Harry.\n  \n\"But I thought he liked me,\" she said plaintively. \"Maybe if you two left, he'd come back again. We had lots in common. I'm sure he felt it.\"\n  \nAnd she looked hopefully toward the door. \"When you say you had lots in common,\" said Ron, sounding rather amused now, \"d'you mean he lives in an S-bend too?\" \n  \n\"No,\" said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. \"I mean he's sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn't got anybody to talk to, and he's not afraid to show his feelings and cry!\" \n  \n\"There's been a boy in here crying?\" said Harry curiously. \"A young boy?\"\n  \n\"Never you mind!\" said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. \"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone, and I'll take his secret to the \u2014\" \n  \n\"\u2014 not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\" Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. \"You're right,\" he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, \"I'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-cide about taking the test.\"\n  \nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement. \n  \n\"You'd do better,\" said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, \"to go straight to Slughorn's of-fice and try and get that memory from him.\" \n  \n\"I've been trying!\" said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone. \n  \n\"He doesn't want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I've been trying to get him on his own again, and he's not going to let it happen!\u201d \n  \n\"Well, you've just got to keep at it, haven't you?\"\n  \nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was do-ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement. \n  \nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-rauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\" and scanned it carefully. \n  \nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-hind her before bending very low and whispering, \"Hello\u2026you're very pretty, aren't you?\" \n  \nGoyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.\n  \nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\n  \n\"OUCH!\"\n  \nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.\n  \n\"Harry?\"\n  \nHe spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor. \n  \n\"What\u2019", "ach when Mrs Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, 'I've ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work wonders.'\n    Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.\n    'How am I getting there?' he asked Mrs Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.\n    'Arthur's taking you to work with him,' said Mrs Weasley gently.\n    Mr Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.\n    'You can wait in my office until it's time for the hearing,' he said.\n    Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs Weasley had answered it.\n    'Professor Dumbledore doesn't think it's a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I - '\n    ' - think he's quite right,' said Sirius through clenched teeth.\n    Mrs Weasley pursed her lips.\n    'When did Dumbledore tell you that?' Harry said, staring at Sirius.\n    'He came last night, when you were in bed,' said Mr Weasley\n    Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse.\n- CHAPTER SEVEN -\nThe Ministry of Magic\nHarry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.\n    Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying net to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen.\n    He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr and Mrs Weasley, Sirius, Lupin and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered.\n    'Breakfast,' she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.\n    'M - m - morning, Harry,' yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. 'Sleep all right?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'I've b - b - been up all night,' she said, with another shuddering yawn. 'Come and sit down . . .'\n    She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it ir the process.\n    'What do you want, Harry?' Mrs Weasley called. 'Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?'\n    'Just - just toast, thanks,' said Harry.\n    Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, 'What were you saying about Scrimgeour?'\n    'Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions . . .'\n    Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn't.\n    '. . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t - t - too tired,' Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.\n    'Ill cover for you,' said Mr Weasley. 'I'm OK, I've got a report to finish anyway\n    Mr Weasley was not wearing wizards' robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.\n    'How are you feeling?'\n    Harry shrugged.\n    'It'll all be over soon,' Mr Weasley said bracingly. 'In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.'\n    Harry said nothing.\n    The hearings on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and the one who'll be questioning you.'\n    'Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,' said Tonks earnestly. 'She's fair, she'll hear you out.'\n    Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.\n    'Don't lose your temper,' said Sirius abruptly. 'Be polite and stick to the facts.'\n    Harry nodded again.\n    The law's on your side,' said Lupin quietly. 'Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.'\n    Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.\n    'Doesn't it ever lie flat?' she said desperately.\n    Harry shook his head.\n    Mr Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. I think we'll go now,' he said. 'We're a bit early, but I think you 11 be better off at the Ministry than hanging around here.'\n    'OK,' said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet.\n    'You'll be all right, Harry,' said Tonks, palling him on the arm.\n    'Good luck,' said Lupin. 'I'm sure it will be fine.'\n    'And if it's not,' said Sirius grimly, 'I'll see to Amelia Bones for you . . .'\n    Harry smiled weakly. Mrs Weasley hugged him.\n    'We've all got our fingers crossed,' she said.\n    'Right,' said Harry. 'Well . . . see you later then.'\n    He followed Mr Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, grey dawn.\n    'You don't normally walk to work, do you?' Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square.\n    'No, I usually Apparate,' said Mr Weasley, 'but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for . . .'\n    Mr Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were al most deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of early-morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.\n    'Simply fabulous,' he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. 'Wonderfully ingenious.'\n    They're out of order,' said Harry, pointing at the sign.\n    'Yes, but even so . . .' said Mr Weasley, beaming at them fondly.\n    They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding", "back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out. After he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.\n    In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry's fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.\n    'Hi, Harry,' he panted. 'Hi, Ginny . . . everywhere's full . . . I can't find a seat . . . '\n    'What are you talking about?' said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. There's room in this one, there's only Loony Lovegood in here - '\n    Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.\n    'Don't be silly,' said Ginny, laughing, 'she's all right.'\n    She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside. Harry and Neville followed.\n    'Hi, Luna.' said Ginny, 'is it OK if we take these seats?'\n    The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave oil an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded.\n    Thanks,' said Ginny, smiling at her.\n    Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig's cage in the luggage rack and sat down. Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn't.\n    'Had a good summer, Luna?' Ginny asked.\n    'Yes,' said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. 'Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You're Harry Potter,' she added.\n    'I know I am,' said Harry.\n    Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes on him instead.\n    'And I don't know who you are.'\n    'I'm nobody,' said Neville hurriedly.\n    'No you're not,' said Ginny sharply. 'Neville Longbottom - Luna Lovegood. Luna's in my year, but in Ravenclaw.'\n    'Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,' said Luna in a singsong voice.\n    She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.\n    The train rattled onwards, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds.\n    'Guess what I got for my birthday?' said Neville.\n    'Another Remembrall?' said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville's grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.\n    'No,' said Neville. 'I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago . . . no, look at this . . .'\n    He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines.\n    'Mimbulus mimbletonia,' he said proudly.\n    Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.\n    'It's really, really rare,' said Neville, beaming. 'I don't know if there's one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can't wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I'm going to see if I can breed from it.'\n    Harry knew that Neville's favourite subject was Herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.\n    'Does it - er - do anything?' he asked.\n    'Loads of stuff!' said Neville proudly. 'It's got an amazing defensive mechanism. Here, hold Trevor for me . . .'\n    He dumped the toad into Harry's lap and took a quill from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood's popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine again, to watch what Neville was\n    doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimblctonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.\n    Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant; thick, stinking, dark green jets of it. They hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood's magazine; Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor's escape, received a faceful. It smelled like rancid manure.\n    Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes.\n    'S - sorry,' he gasped. 'I haven't tried that before . . . didn't realise it would be quite so . . . don't worry, though, Stinksap's not poisonous,' he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor.\n    At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.\n    'Oh . . . hello, Harry,' said a nervous voice. 'Urn . . . bad time?'\n    Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.\n    'Oh . . . hi,' said Harry blankly.\n    'Um . . .' said Cho. 'Well . . . just thought I'd say hello . . . bye then.'\n    Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.\n    'Never mind,' said Ginny bracingly. 'Look, we can easily get rid of all this.' She pulled out her wand. 'Scourgify!'\n    The Stinksap vanished.\n    'Sorry.' said Neville again, in a small voice.\n    Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.\n    'I'm starving,' said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the frog's head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning.\n    'Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,' said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. 'Boy and girl from each.'\n    'And guess who's", "with her, an' all,\" said Hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. \"The less you lot 'ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh'll be. Yeh can trust any of 'em.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,\" Harry said, annoyed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don' you talk ter me abou' her!\" said Hagrid, and he looked quite frightening for a moment. \"I've got her number now! Tryin' ter get back in me good books, tryin' ter get me ter tell her what's comin in the third task. Ha! You can' trust any of'em!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE - THE DREAM\n\u3000\u3000It comes down to this,\" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. \"Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn't looking.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It must've been Crouch,\" said Ron at once. \"That's why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He'd done a runner.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"He seemed really weak - I don't reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven't I told you enough times?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay. . . hows this for a theory,\" said Ron excitedly. \"Krum attacked Crouch - no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?\" said Hermione coldly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yeah . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\" said Ron tentatively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he's getting stronger.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak.\n\u3000\u3000\"If Snape hadn't held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might've got there in time. 'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter?' Why couldn't he have just got out of the way?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe he didn't want you to get there!\" said Ron quickly. \"Maybe - hang on - how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest? D'you reckon he could've beaten you and Dumbledore there?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't put it past him,\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"We need to see Professor Moody,\" said Hermione. \"We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,\"\n\u3000\u3000\"If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\" said Ron, \"because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Shh!\" said Hermione suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.\n\u3000\u3000\"- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn't like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?\"\n\u3000\u3000The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"What're you doing here?\" Ron and Fred said at the same time.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sending a letter,\" said Harry and George in unison.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, at this time?\" said Hermione and Fred.\n\u3000\u3000Fred grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine - we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us,\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, don't let us hold you up,\" Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.\n\u3000\u3000Ron didn't move. \"Who're you blackmailing?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000The grin vanished from Fred's face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be stupid, I was only joking,\" he said easily.\n\u3000\u3000\"Didn't sound like that,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \"I've told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can't see why you would, but -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's my business if you're blackmailing someone,\" said Ron. \"George's right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Told you, I was joking,\" said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \"You're starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you'll be made a prefect.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, I won't!\" said Ron hotly.\n\u3000\u3000George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.\"\n\u3000\u3000He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.\n\u3000\u3000\"You don't think they know something about all this, do you?\" Hermione whispered. \"About Crouch and everything?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry. \"If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. They'd tell Dumbledore.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" Hermione asked him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well. . .\" said Ron slowly, \"I dunno if they would. They're . . . they're obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them", "so we'll see you quite soon,\" said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. \"You make sure you look after yourself and ?quot;\nThe train was gathering speed.\n\"?be good and ?quot; , She was jogging to keep up now.\n\"?stay safe!\"\nHarry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects' carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \"Chosen One\" rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n\"Fancy trying to find a compartment?\"\n\"I can't, Harry, I said I'd meet Dean,\" said Ginny brightly. \"See you later.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n\"Hi, Harry!\" said a familiar voice from behind him.\n\"Neville!\" said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.\n\"Hello, Harry,\" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n\"Luna, hi, how are you?\"\n\"Very well, thank you,\" said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n\"Quibbler still going strong, then?\" asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\n\"Oh yes, circulation's well up,\" said Luna happily.\n\"Let's find seats,\" said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n\"They're even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \"Because we're with you!\"\n\"They're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\" said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \"Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must've\nseen it.\"\n\"Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\" said Neville, \"but she was really pleased. Says I'm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\"\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n\"Cherry and unicorn hair,\" he said proudly. \"We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day ?oi, come back here, Trevor!\"\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n\"Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\" asked Luna,\nwho was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n\"No point now we've got rid of Umbridge, is there?\" said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n\"I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\"\n\"I enjoyed the meetings too,\" said Luna serenely. \"It was like having friends.\"\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.\n\"You ask him!\"\nNo, you!\n\"I'll do it!\"\nAnd one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.\n\"Hi, Harry, I'm Romilda, Romilda Vane,\" she said loudly and confidently. \"Why don't you join us in our compartment? You don't have to sit with them,\" she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville's bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\n\"They're friends of mine,\" said Harry coldly.\n\"Oh,\" said the girl, looking very surprised. \"Oh. Okay.\"\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\n\"People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,\" said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.\n\"You are cool,\" said Harry shortly. \"None of them was at the Ministry. They didn't fight with me.\"\n\"That's a very nice thing to say,\" beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The\nQuibbler.\n\"We didn't face him, though,\" said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \"You did. You should hear my gran talk about you. 'That Harry Potter's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!' She'd give anything to have you as a grand-son. . . .\nHarry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an \"Acceptable,\" Harry watched him without really listening.\nNeville's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry's had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry's destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. ... Or would it? Would Neville\u2019s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no \"Chosen One\" at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron's?\n\"You all right, Harry? You look funny,\" said Neville.\nHarry started. \"Sorry ?I ?quot;\n\"Wrackspurt got you?\" asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.\n\"I \u2014what?\"\n\"A Wrackspurt. . . They're invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\" she said. \"I thought I felt one zooming around in here.\"\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other's eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\n\"Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I'm starving,\" said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. \"Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\" he added, turning to Harry. \"Malfoy s not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\"\nHarry sat up straight, interested", "on loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood. 'Gave 'em the old one-two, did you?'\n    'You can't give a Dementor the old one-two,' said Harry through clenched teeth.\n    'Why's he all right, then?' blustered Uncle Vernon. 'Why isn't e all empty, then?'\n    'Because I used the Patronus - '\n    WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.\n    'FOR GOD'S SAKE!' roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn't been driven to do in a long time. 'I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!'\n    But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl's leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything - the Dementors, Mrs Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out - that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message.\n    Arthur has just told us what's happened. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.\n    Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else.\n    And now his temper was rising again. Wasn't anybody going to say 'well done' for fighting off two Dementors single-handed? Both Mr Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he'd misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.\n    '. . . a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house. I won't have it, boy, I won't - '\n    'I can't stop the owls coming,' Harry snapped, crushing Sirius's letter in his fist.\n    'I want the truth about what happened tonight!' barked Uncle Vernon. 'If it was Demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you've been expelled? You did you-know-what, you've admitted, it!'\n    Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.\n    'I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the Dementors,' he said, forcing himself to remain calm. 'It's the only thing that works against them.'\n    'But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?' said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone.\n    'Couldn't tell you,' said Harry wearily. 'No idea.'\n    His head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.\n    'It's you,' said Uncle Vernon forcefully. 'It's got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You've got to be the only - the only - ' Evidently, he couldn't bring himself to say the word 'wizard'. The only you-know-what for miles.'\n    'I don't know why they were here.'\n    But at Uncle Vernon's words, Harry's exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why had the Dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the Dementors? Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?\n    'These Demembers guard some weirdo prison?' asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in the wake of Harry's train of thought.\n    'Yes,' said Harry.\n    If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think . . .\n    'Oho! They were coming to arrest you!' said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. That's it, isn't it, boy? You're on the run from the law!'\n    'Of course I'm not,' said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now.\n    Then why - ?'\n    'He must have sent them,' said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.\n    'What's that? Who must have sent them?'\n    'Lord Voldemort,' said Harry.\n    He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if they heard words like 'wizard', 'magic' or 'wand', could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.\n    'Lord - hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes. 'I've heard that name . . . that was the one who - '\n    'Murdered my parents, yes,' Harry said dully.\n    'But he's gone,' said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic. That giant bloke said so. He's gone.'\n    'He's back,' said Harry heavily.\n    It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside the top'-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the Dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world, and Mrs Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; Dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts. Harry's head throbbed more painfully.\n    'Back?' whispered Aunt Petunia.\n    She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sisters) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life - that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon - seemed to have fallen away.\n    'Yes,' Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. ;He came back a month ago. I saw him.'\n    Her hands found Dudley's massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.\n    'Hang on,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. 'Hang on. This Lord Voldything's back, you say.'\n    'Yes.'\n    The one who murdered your parents.'\n    'Yes.'\n    'And now he's sending Dismembers after you?'\n    'Looks like it,' said Harry.\n    T see,' said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his\n    great purple face stretching before Harry's eyes. 'Well, that settles it,' he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, 'you can get out of this house, boy!'\n    'What?' said Harry.\n    '", "\n\u3000\u3000\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.' Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt.\n\u3000\u3000What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods. . .\n\u3000\u3000well, there certainly will be rumors now she's printed that.\"\n\u3000\u3000He heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I'm going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.\"\n\u3000\u3000He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. \"Arthur, you're supposed to be on holiday! This hasn't got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to go, Molly,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I've made things worse. I'll just change into my robes and I'll be off. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \"Hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me, has she?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hedwig, dear?\" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \"No. . . no, there hasn't been any post at all.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah. . . think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's up, Harry?\" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them.\n\u3000\u3000\"There's something I haven't told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.\n\u3000\u3000\"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him.. . him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill...someone.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn't bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.\n\u3000\u3000\"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but was it, though?\" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It's weird, isn't it?. . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't - say - his - name!\" Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\n\u3000\u3000\"And remember what Professor Trelawney said?\" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione's terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh Harry, you aren't going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You weren't there,\" said Harry. \"You didn't hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance - a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would rise again. .\n\u3000\u3000. greater and more terrible than ever before. . . and he'd manage it because his servant was going to go back to him. . . and that night Wormtail escaped.\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?\" Hermione asked. \"Are you expecting a letter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told Sirius about my scar,\" said Harry, shrugging. \"I'm waiting for his answer.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Good thinking!\" said Ron, his expression clearing. \"I bet Sirius'll know what to do!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I hoped he'd get back to me quickly,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"But we don't know where Sirius is. . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000said Hermione reasonably. \"Hedwig's not going to manage that journey in a few days.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I know,\" said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry\" said Ron. \"Come on - three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. .. . You can try out the Wronski Feint... .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron,\" said Hermione, in an I-don't-think-you're-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, \"Harry doesn't want to play Quidditch right now... . He's worried, and he's tired. . . .\n\u3000\u3000We all need to go to bed...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,\" said Harry suddenly. \"Hang on, I'll get my Firebolt.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like \"Boys.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's been an absolute uproar,\" Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. \"I've been putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don't open a Howler straight away, it explodes.\n\u3000\u3000Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why are they all sending Howlers?\" asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.\n\u3000\u3000\"Complaining about security at the World Cup,\" said Percy. \"They want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher's put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I've got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.\"\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative.\n\u3000\u3000It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family's names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. \"Home,\" \"school,\" and \"work\" were there, but there was also \"traveling,\"\n\u3000\u3000\"lost,\" \"hospital,\" \"prison,\" and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \"mortal peril.\"\n\u3000\u3000Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the \"home\" position, but Mr. Weasley's, which was the longest, was still pointing to \"work.\" Mrs. We", "crowd, Harry followed Mr Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises.\n    'All right, Arthur?' said the wizard, nodding at Mr Weasley.\n    What've you got there, Bob?' asked Mr Weasley, looking at the box.\n    'We're not sure,' said the wizard seriously. 'We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.'\n    With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.\n    'Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office.'\n    The lift doors opened. Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls. One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman's voice announced:\n    'Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office and Apparation Test Centre.'\n    Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see Ministry of Magic stamped along the edge of their wings.\n    'Just inter-departmental memos,' Mr Weasley muttered to him. 'We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings a I over the desks\n    As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lift's ceiling.\n    'Level Five, Department of International Magical Co-operation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.'\n    When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it.\n    'Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau.\n    ' 'S'cuse,' said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again.\n    'Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.'\n    Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr Weasley, Harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement.\n    'Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services.'\n    'This is us, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. 'My office is on the other side of the floor.'\n    'Mr Weasley,' said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, 'aren't we still underground?'\n    'Yes, we are,' said Mr Weasley. Those are enchanted windows. Magical Maintenance decide what weather we'll get every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise . . . Just round here, Harry.'\n    They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read: Auror Headquarters.\n    Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything From pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favourite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n    'Morning, Weasley,' said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?'\n    'Yes, if it really is a second,' said Mr Weasley, 'I'm in rather a hurry.'\n    They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr We ashy stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle.\n    Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction was Sirius's face. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding - 'papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.\n    'Here,' said Kingsley brusquely to Mr Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand. 'I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.'\n    Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, 'Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.' Then he said in normal tones, 'And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.'\n    'If you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms,' said Mr Weasley coolly. 'And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we're extremely busy at the moment.' He dropped his voice and said, 'If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.'\n    He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading: Misuse of Muggle Artefacts.\n    Mr Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr Weasley's obsessions: several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine; two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books; and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.\n    Sitting on top of Mr Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a dis", "about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry \"Finished,\" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.\n\u3000\u3000\"I can't use you,\" Harry told her, looking around for the school owls.\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got to use one of these.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.\n\u3000\u3000\"First Ron, then you,\" Harry said angrily. \"This isn't my fault.\"\n\u3000\u3000If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons - and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the\n\u3000\u3000tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\n\u3000\u3000The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him -but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.\n\u3000\u3000He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.\n\u3000\u3000Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have died..\n\u3000\u3000. how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task's my bet.\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.\n\u3000\u3000\"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes.\n\u3000\u3000\"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Roun' the middle,\" said Hagrid, demonstrating. \"Er - yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus' as an extra precaution, like. Harry - you come here an' help me with this big one....\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's real intention, however, was totalk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \"So - yer competin', Harry. In the tournament. School champion.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"One of the champions,\" Harry corrected him.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.\n\u3000\u3000\"No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You believe I didn't do it, then?\" said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid's words.\n\u3000\u3000\"Course I do,\" Hagrid grunted. \"Yeh say it wasn' you, an' I believe yeh - an' Dumbledore believes yer, an' all.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wish I knew who did do it,\" said Harry bitterly.\n\u3000\u3000The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs - but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?\" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah, I don' know, Harry,\" Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face. \"School champion. . . everythin' seems ter happen ter you, doesn' it?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry didn't answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him. . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.\n\u3000\u3000The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.\n\u3000\u3000He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins - he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship.\n\u3000\u3000But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.\n\u3000\u3000Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum's autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.\n\u3000\u3000Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing", "ter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now.'\n    Harry smiled.\n    'You can't help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.'\n    He bent and picked up his Potions book. He'd have to try to finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand - the result of his detentions with Umbridge . . .\n    Wait a moment - there is something you can do for me, Dobby,' said Harry slowly.\n    The elf looked round, beaming.\n    'Name it, Harry Potter, sir!'\n    'I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,' Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, 'Professor Umbridge.'\n    He expected the elf's smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find somewhere, but his hopes were not high. What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his hands together.\n    'Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!' he said happily. 'Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!'\n    'Why?' said Harry curiously.\n    'Because it is a room that a person can only enter,' said Dobby seriously, 'when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs. Dobby has used it, sir,' said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, 'when Winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir . . . and Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and - '\n    'And if you really needed a bathroom,' said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, 'would it fill itself with chamber pots?'\n    'Dobby expects so, sir,' said Dobby, nodding earnestly. 'It is a most amazing room, sir.'\n    'How many people know about it?' said Harry, sitting up straight er in his chair.\n    'Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.'\n    'It sounds brilliant,' said Harry, his heart racing. 'It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?'\n    'Any time, Harry Potter, sir,' said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry's enthusiasm. 'We could go now, if you like!'\n    For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby. He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had Snape's essay to finish.\n    'Not tonight, Dobby,' said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. This is really important . . . I don't want to blow it, it'll need proper planning. Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there?'\n*\nTheir robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon's Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled.\n    'Good,' said Harry quietly, when she. told him, 'because we've found somewhere to have our first Defence meeting. Tonight, eight o'clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?'\n    She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him.\n    'What?' he said thickly.\n    Well . . . it's just that Dobby's plans aren't always that safe. Don't you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?'\n    This room isn't just some mad idea of Dobby's; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.'\n    Hermione's expression cleared.\n    'Dumbledore told you about it?'\n    'Just in passing,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'Oh, well, that's all right then,' said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections.\n    Together - 'with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog's Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry's disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog's Head.\n    At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor.\n    'Hold it,' Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and muttering, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\"\n    A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots, labelled with names, showed where various people were.\n    'Filch is on the second floor,' said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, 'and Mrs Norris is on the fourth.'\n    'And Umbridge?' said Hermione anxiously.\n    'In her office,' said Harry, pointing. 'OK, let's go.'\n    They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.\n    'OK,' said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them. 'Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.'\n    They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; Hermione was whispering something under her breath; Harry's fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him.\n    We need somewhere to learn to fight . . . he thought. Just give us a place to practise . . . somewhere they can't find us . . .\n    'Harry!' said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.\n    A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.\n    The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that", "capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.\"\nHe inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did nor soften.\n\"You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?\"\n\"Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?\" asked Snape.\n\"He . . . lately, we ... I am asking you, Snape!\"\n\"If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible \u2014\"\n\"You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!\" she jeered.\n\"I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago. . . .\"\n\"But why did you keep him alive?\"\n\"Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.\n\"Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.\"\n\"And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?\" asked Bellatrix. \"He has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?\"\n\"I have played my part well,\" said Snape. \"And you overlook Dumbledore's greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms \u2014 though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard \u2014 oh yes, he has,\" (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), \"the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.\"\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\n\"Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?\"\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\n\"Yes, Severus. I \u2014 I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .\"\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\n\"The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,\" Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. \"He wishes none to know of the plan. It is ... very secret. But \u2014\"\n\"If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,\" said Snape at once. \"The Dark Lord's word is law.\"\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.\n\"There!\" she said triumphantly to her sister. \"Even Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!\"\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n\"It so happens that I know of the plan,\" he said in a low voice. \"I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.\"\n\"I thought you must know about it!\" said Narcissa, breathing more freely. \"He trusts you so, Severus. ...\"\n\"You know about the plan?\" said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. \"You know?\"\n\"Certainly,\" said Snape. \"But what help do you require, Nar-cissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.\"\n\"Severus,\" she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. \"My son . . . my only son . . .\"\n\"Draco should be proud,\" said Bellatrix indifferently. \"The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: he isn't shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect \u2014\"\nNarcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.\n\"That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Lucius's mistake, I know it!\"\nSnape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.\n\"That's why he's chosen Draco, isn't it?\" she persisted. \"To punish Lucius?\"\n\"If Draco succeeds,\" said Snape, still looking away from her, \"he will be honored above all others.\"\n\"But he won't succeed!\" sobbed Narcissa. \"How can he, when the Dark Lord himself\u2014 ?\"\nBellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.\n\"I only meant. . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius's old friend. ... I beg you. .. . You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him \u2014 ?\"\n\"The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,\" said Snape flatly. \"I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.\"\n\"Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!\" choked Narcissa. \"He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!\"\nWhen Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, \"You could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us \u2014\"\nSnape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, \"He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.\"\n\"In other words, it doesn't matter to", "ble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n\"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,\n\"You've forgotten something...\"\nNeville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\n115\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!\"'\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\nHarry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three\n-- two --\"\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it's all right,\n116\nup you get.\".\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\"\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\n\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,\nParvati.\"\n\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\"\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"\n\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n117\n\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble.\"\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\nheld the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\"HARRY POTTER!\"\nHis heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"\n118\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\"\n\"It wasn't his fault, Professor --\"\n\"Be quiet, Miss Patil\n\"But Malfoy --\"\n\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking", "umbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had crossed the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, are you all right? I knew it - I knew something like this - what happened?\"\n\u3000\u3000His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened?\" he asked more urgently.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore.\n\u3000\u3000There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\n\u3000\u3000\"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze. Harry,\" said Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can leave that till morning, can't we, Dumbledore?\" said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. \"Let him have a sleep. Let him rest.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius's words. He leaned forward toward Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\n\u3000\u3000\"If I thought I could help you,\" Dumbledore said gently, \"by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\"\n\u3000\u3000The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\n\u3000\u3000He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric's body, lying on the ground beside the cup.\n\u3000\u3000Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry's shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.\n\u3000\u3000When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.\n\u3000\u3000\"He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,\" Harry told Dumbledore. \"He said the protection my - my mother left in me - he'd have it too. And he was right - he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.\"\n\u3000\u3000For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second. Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Very well,\" he said, sitting down again. \"Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort's speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.\n\u3000\u3000But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his father . . . his mother . .\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.\n\u3000\u3000\"The wands connected?\" he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. \"Why?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Priori Incantatem,\" he muttered.\n\u3000\u3000His eyes gazed into Harry's and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Reverse Spell effect?\" said Sirius sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Harry's wand and Voldemorts wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,\" he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry's knee.\n\u3000\u3000\"My wand's feather came from Fawkes?\" Harry said, amazed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So what happens when a wand meets its brother?\" said Sirius.\n\u3000\u3000\"They will not work properly against each other,\" said Dumbledore. \"If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place.\n\u3000\u3000One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed - in reverse. The most recent first. . . and then those which preceded it. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\n\u3000\u3000\"Which means,\" said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry's face, \"that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry nodded again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Diggory came back to life?\" said Sirius sharply.\n\u3000\u3000\"No spell can reawaken the dead,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He spoke to me,\" Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. \"The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An echo,\" said Dumbledore, \"which retained Cedric's appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort's wand....\"\n\u3000\u3000\"An old man,\" Harry said, his throat still constricted. \"Bertha Jorkins. And . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your parents?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius's grip on Harry's shoulder was now so tight it was painful.\n\u3000\u3000\"The last murders the wand performed,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . .. what did they do?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry's mother had told him what", "'s office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal.\n    'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St Mungo's on its front. 'It says here you need at least \"E\" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey . . . don't want much, do they?'\n    'Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?' said Hermione absently.\n    She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, 'SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?' 'You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!'\n    'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly. 'Good sense of when to duck, more like.' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . . They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'\n    'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'\n    'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. 'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. 'She says you need to talk to Sirius?'\n    'What?' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.\n    'Yeah . . .' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '\n    'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\n    'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\n    'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\n    He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\n    'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\n    'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\n    'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\n    He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\n    'Are - you - insane?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily.\n    'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'And how are you going to get in there in the first place?'\n    Harry was ready for this question.\n    'Sirius's knife,' he said.\n    'Excuse me?'\n    'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry. 'So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has - '\n    'What do you think about this?' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\n    'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. 'If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it?'\n    'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. 'Right, then. We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact ii everybody's in the corridors - Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office - I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?' he said, looking at George.\n    'Easy,' said George.\n    'What sort of diversion is it?' asked Ron.\n    'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again. 'At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow.'\n*\nHarry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.\n    After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his fathers behaviour . . .\n    Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal tc stoking the fire.\n    Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.\n    With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in\n    History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\n    '. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .'\n    'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop", "toward the plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup's gleaming handles.\n\u3000\u3000\"On three, right?\" said Harry. \"One - two - three -\"\n\u3000\u3000He and Cedric both grasped a handle.\n\u3000\u3000Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground.\n\u3000\u3000He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO - FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where are we?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around.\n\u3000\u3000They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles -perhaps hundreds of miles - for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone.\n\u3000\u3000They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\" he asked.\n\u3000\u3000\"Nope,\" said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \"Is this supposed to be part of the task?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I dunno,\" said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \"Wands out, d'you reckon?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.\n\u3000\u3000They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the\n\u3000\u3000strange feeling that they were being watched.\n\u3000\u3000\"Someone's coming,\" he said suddenly.\n\u3000\u3000Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn't make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.\n\u3000\u3000Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And - several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time - Harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a bundle of robes?\n\u3000\u3000Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\n\u3000\u3000It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.\n\u3000\u3000And then, without warning, Harry's scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\n\u3000\u3000From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \"Kill the spare.\"\n\u3000\u3000A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \"Avada Kedavra!\"\n\u3000\u3000A blast of green light blazed through Harry's eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\n\u3000\u3000For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric's face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry's mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\n\u3000\u3000The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.\n\u3000\u3000TOM RIDDLE The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him - hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.\n\u3000\u3000\"You!\" he gasped.\n\u3000\u3000But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn't move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry's mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn't make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn't turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.\n\u3000\u3000Cedric's body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry's wand was on the ground at Cedric's feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.\n\u3000\u3000It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn't want to see what was in those robes ...\n\u3000\u3000he didn't want that bundle opened....\n\u3000\u3000He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail's fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry's range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water - Harry could hear it slopping around - and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.\n\u3000\u3000The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling names beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.\n\u3000\u3000The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry!\"\n\u3000\u3000The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.\n\u3000\u3000\"It is ready. Master.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Now ...\" said the cold voice.\n\u3000\u3000Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.\n\u3000\u3000It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind - but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face - no child alive ever had a face like that - flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.\n\u3000\u3000The thing seemed", "as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.\n\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.\"\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained\nwith silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\n\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n99\n\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"\nThe others laughed.\n\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\n\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\nnot be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\nOn Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harry's forehead.\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy.\n100\n\"N-nothing.\"\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\n\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"\nDumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor\non the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.\n101\n\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\n\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed:\n\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please,\nWhether we be old and bald\nOr young with scabby knees,\nOur heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff,\nFor now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff,\nSo teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot,\njust do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they\n102\nhad finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were\nlike lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their\nfeet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes", "NOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE - '\n    The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head. 'You've got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry - and there goes Sirius's mum again.'\n    Mrs Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.\n    George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.\n    Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.\n    The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's.\n    '. . . smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do . . .'\n    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.\n    The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.\n    'Kreacher did not see young master,' he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, 'Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.'\n    'Sorry?' said George. 'Didn't catch that last bit.'\n    'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second box to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there its twin, unnataral little beasts they are.'\n    Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.\n    '. . . and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesn't know . . .\"\n    This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively. 'Harry Potter.'\n    Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.\n    The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say - '\n    'Don't call her a Mudblood!' said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.\n    'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '\n    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.\n    Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.\n    'Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '\n    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred.\n    'What do you want, anyway?' George asked.\n    Kreacher's huge eyes darted towards George.\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' he said evasively.\n    'A likely story,' said a voice behind Harry.\n    Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen.\n    At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.\n    'Stand up straight,' said Sirius impatiently. 'Now, what are you up to?'\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' the elf repeated. 'Kreacher lives to serve lie Noble House of Black - '\n    'And it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,' said Sirius.\n    'Master always liked his little joke,' said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 'Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart - '\n    'My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,' snapped Sirius. 'She kept herself alive out of pure spite.'\n    Kreacher bowed again as he spoke.\n    'Whatever Master says,' he muttered furiously. 'Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was - '\n    'I asked you what you were up to,' said Sirius coldly. 'Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can't throw it out.'\n    'Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,' said the elf, then muttered very fast, 'Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it - '\n    'I thought it might be that,' said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. 'She'll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don't doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.'\n    It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.\n    ' - comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he's back, they say he's a murderer too - '\n    'Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!' said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf.\n    'Sirius, he's not right in the head,' Hermione pleaded, 'I don't think he realises we can hear him.'\n    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '\n    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '\n    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly. 'And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.'\n    Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.\n    The tapestry looked immensely old; it was laded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black\nToujours pur'\n'You're", "made to leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practise; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial Potions.\n    He was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe. He stopped, and stood looking at it, reminded of something . . . then he remembered: it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights n the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.\n    He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape's thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's defences accidentally . . .\n    Harry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him . . . what was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?\n    The silvery lights shivered on the wall . . . Harry took two steps towards the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?\n    Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterwards, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right.\n    Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.\n    The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling . . . in fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down into the Great Hall.\n    His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape's thoughts . . . his brain seemed to be in limbo . . . it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do . . . he was trembling . . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of Cho's anger, of Malfoy's jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.\n    He took a great gulp of breath, and plunged his face into the surface of Snape's thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry head-first into the Pensieve . . .\n    He was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then - '\n    He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four house tables were gone. Instead, there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.\n    Sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere . . . this was his memory . . .\n    And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS - ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.\n    So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age. His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.\n    'Five more minutes!'\n    The voice made Harry jump. Turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick's head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very untidy black hair . . .\n    Harry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy's head drew nearer and . . . he was straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written . . .\n    Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father.\n    Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.\n    James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been. Then, with a glance towards Professor Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him.\n    With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this girl - Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm - was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.\n    So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too . . . and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbour's paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters 'L.E.'. What did they stand for?\n    'Quills down, please!' squeaked Professor Flitwick. That means you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Accio!'\n    Over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick's outstretched arms, knocking him backwards off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet.\n    'Thank you . . . thank you,' panted Professor Flitwick. 'Very well, everybody, you're free to go!'\n    Harry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the 'L.E.' he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.\n    Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face.\n    A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and L", "-\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.\n\u3000\u3000\"By all accounts, he is no loss!\" blustered Fudge. \"It seems he has been responsible for several deaths'.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \"He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Why he killed them? Well, that's no mystery, is it?\" blustered Fudge. \"He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who's instructions!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,\" Dumbledore said. \"Those peoples deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn't quite believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000\"You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\" said Dumbledore, \"we heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort - learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins -went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"See here, Dumbledore,\" said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, \"you - you can't seriously believe that You-Know-Who - back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore steadily. \"He witnessed Lord Voldemort's rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, \"I am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge's curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \"You are - er - prepared to take Harry's word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\"\n\u3000\u3000There was a moment's silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Certainly, I believe Harry,\" said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \"I heard Crouch's confession, and I heard Harry's account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\n\u3000\u3000\"You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well...\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n\u3000\u3000\"You've been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\" he said quietly.\n\u3000\u3000Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized that Harry was awake.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n\u3000\u3000\"And if I have?\" he said, looking at Dumbledore. \"If I have discovered that you've been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\"\n\u3000\u3000said Dumbledore coolly.\n\u3000\u3000\"You admit that he has been having these pains, then?\" said Fudge quickly. \"Headaches?\n\u3000\u3000Nightmares? Possibly - hallucinations?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Listen to me, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. \"Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.\n\u3000\u3000\"You'll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I've never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, I saw Voldemort come back!\" Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. \"I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names!\n\u3000\u3000Lucius Malfoy -\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape's eyes flew back to Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"Malfoy was cleared!\" said Fudge, visibly affronted. \"A very old family - donations to excellent causes -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Macnair!\" Harry continued.\n\u3000\u3000\"Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Avery - Nott - Crabbe - Goyle -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!\" said Fudge angrily. \"You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heavens sake, Dumbledore - the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too - his tales are getting taller, and you're still swallowing them - the boy can talk to snakes. Dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You fool!\" Professor McGonagall cried. \"Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I see no evidence to the contrary!\" shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. \"It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world - to believe that Voldemort could have risen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Voldemort has returned,\" Dumbledore repeated. \"If you accept that fact straightaway.\n\u3000\u3000Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Preposterous!\" shouted Fudge again. \"Remove the dementors? I'd be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!\" said Dumbledore. \"They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge!\n\u3000\u3000Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him,", "et, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. \"I haven't for-gotten about Slughorn, but I haven't got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn't I find out what Malfoy's doing?\" \n  \n\"I've already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,\" said Her-mione. \"It's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement\" \u2014 she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page \u2014 \"you should go and find Slughorn and start appeal-ing to his better nature.\" \n  \n\"Anyone we know \u2014 ?\" asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.\n  \n\"Yes!\" said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. \"But it's all right, he's not dead \u2014 its Mundungus, he's been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse.\" \n  \nThey finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off imme-diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape's dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet. \n  \nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl. \n  \nHe closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement's door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, \u201cI need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here... I need to see what Malfoy's doing in here...\u201d \n  \nThree times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it \u2014 but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding. \n  \n\"Okay,\" said Harry aloud. \"Okay... I thought the wrong thing...\" He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-centrating as hard as he could. \u201cI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly...\u201d After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly. \n  \nThere was no door.\n  \n\"Oh, come off it,\" he told the wall irritably. \"That was a clear instruction. Fine.\" He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. \u201cI need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy...\u201d \n  \nHe did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes. \n  \nThere was still no door.\n  \nHarry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\nHarry tried every variation of \"I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\" that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went. \n  \n\"Late again, Potter,\" said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. \"Ten points from Gryfrindor.\" Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and orga-nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them. \n  \n\"Before we start, I want your dementor essays,\" said Snape, wav-ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \"And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page \u2014 what is it, Mr. Finnigan?\" \n  \n\"Sir,\" said Seamus, \"I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius \u2014\" \n  \n\"No, there wasn't,\" said Snape in a bored voice. \n  \n\"But sir, I heard people talking \u2014\" \n  \n\"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\" \n  \n\"I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,\" mut-tered Harry to Ron and Hermione. \"Shouldn't he be upset Mun-dungus has been arrest \u2014\" \n  \n\"But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,\" said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. \"Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.\" \n  \nThe whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. \"Er \u2014 well \u2014 ghosts are transparent \u2014\" he said. \n  \n\"Oh, very good,\" interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \"Yes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. 'Ghosts are transparent.\"' \n  \nPansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, \"Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren't they? So they'd be solid \u2014\" \n  \n\"A five-year-old could have told us as much,\" sneered Snape. \"The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-ard's spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard's bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. \" \n  \n\"Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we're trying to tell them apart!\" said Ron. \"When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we're going to be having a look to see if its solid, aren't we, we're not going to be asking, 'Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?'\" There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class. \n  \n\"Another ten points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape. \"I would ex-pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.\" \n  \n\"No!\" whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. \"There's no point, you'll just end up in", "is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable lo Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it.'\n    'Like what?' said Harry.\n    'Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.\n    Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, and that you knew where he was - but Kreacher's information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.'\n    Harry's lips were cold and numb.\n    'So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .'\n    The Malfoy's - undoubtedly on Voldemort's instructions - had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the Hippogriff yesterday, and, at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs tending to him.'\n    There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs; his breathing was quick and shallow.\n    'And Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?' he croaked.\n    'He did not wish to tell me,' said Dumbledore. 'But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.'\n    'And,' whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, 'and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him - '\n    'She was quite right, Harry,' said Dumbledore. 'I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our Headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's - '\n    'Don't you blame - don't you - talk - about Sirius like - ' Harry's breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly; but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again: he would not let Dumbledore criticise Sirius. 'Kreacher's a lying - foul - he deserved - '\n    'Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,' said Dumbledore. 'Yes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby's. He was forced to do Sirius's bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher's faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher's lot easier - '\n    'DON'T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!' Harry yelled.\n    He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered . . .\n    'What about Snape?' Harry spat. 'You're not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual - '\n    'Harry you know Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,' said Dumbledore steadily, 'but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the Forest. It was he, too, who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her Sirius's whereabouts.'\n    Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him.\n    'Snape - Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house - 'he made out Sirius was a coward - '\n    'Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,' said Dumbledore.\n    'Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!' Harry snarled. 'He threw me out of his office!'\n    'I am aware of it,' said Dumbledore heavily. 'I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence - '\n    'Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him - ' Harry remembered Ron's thoughts on the subject and plunged on '- how do you know he wasn't trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my - '\n    'I trust Severus Snape,' said Dumbledore simply. 'But I forgot - another old man's mistake - that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father - I was wrong.'\n    'But that's OK, is it?' yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls. 'It's OK: for Snape to hate my dad, but it's not OK for Sirius to hate Kreacher?'\n    'Sirius did not hate Kreacher,' said Dumbledore. 'He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike . . . the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.'\n    'SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?' Harry yelled.\n    'I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,' Dumbledore: replied quietly. 'Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house - 'elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.'\n    'Yeah, he did hate it!' said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realising what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. 'You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that's why he wanted to get out last night - '\n    'I was trying to keep Sirius alive,' said Dumbledore quietly.\n    'People don't like being locked up!' Harry said furiously, rounding on him. 'You did it to me all last summer - '\n    Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him.\n    Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.\n    'It is time,' he said, 'for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me - to do whatever you like - when I have finished. I will not stop you.'\n    Harry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited.\n    Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, 'Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep.", "ard, Harry, you made me jump,\" said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. \"How did you get out of the castle?\" \n  \n\"I think Filch must've forgotten to lock the doors,\" said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl. \n  \n\"I'll be reporting that man, he's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Harry?\" \n  \n\"Well, sir, it's Hagrid,\" said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. \"He's pretty upset. . . But you won't tell anyone, Professor? I don't want trouble for him. ...\" \n  \nSlughorn's curiosity was evidently aroused. \"Well, I can't promise that,\" he said gruffly. \"But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. .. \n.\" \n\"Well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... It lived in the forest. ... It could talk and everything \u2014\" \n  \n\"I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,\" said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. \"It's true, then?\" \n  \n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He's devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I'd go.\" \n  \n\"Touching, touching,\" said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid's cabin. \"But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. ...\" \n  \nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. \". . . seems an awful waste not to collect it... might get a hun-dred Galleons a pint. ... To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .\" \n  \nAnd now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. \"Well,\" he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, \"well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know ...\" \n  \n\"Yes, of course,\" said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. \"I tell you what, Harry, I'll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We'll drink the poor beast's \u2014 well \u2014 not health \u2014 but we'll send it off in style, anyway, once it's buried. And I'll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-sion. . . .\" \n  \nHe bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid's, delighted with himself. \n  \n\"Yen came,\" croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him. \n  \n\"Yeah \u2014 Ron and Hermione couldn't, though,\" said Harry. \"They're really sorry.\" \n  \n\"Don \u2014 don matter . . . Hed've bin touched yeh're here, though, Harry. . . .\" \n  \nHagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. \n  \n\"Where are we burying him?\" he asked. \"The forest?\" \n  \n\"Blimey, no,\" said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. \"The other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog's gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didn' eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?\" \n  \nThe honest answer was \"yes\"; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the aero-mantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. \n  \n\"Never bin an area o' the forest I couldn' go before!\" said Hagrid, shaking his head. \"It wasn' easy, gettin' Aragog's body out o' there, I can tell yeh \u2014 they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give 'im a nice burial... a proper send-off. . .\" \n  \nHe broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), \"Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.\" \n  \n\"Not in trouble, are yeh?\" said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. \"Yeh shouldn\u2019 be outta the castle in the evenin', I know it, it's my fault \u2014\" \n  \n\"No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he'd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,\" said Harry. \n  \n\"He's gone to change into something more suitable, I think\u2026and he said he'd bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog's mem-ory...\u201d \n  \n\"Did he?\" said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. \"Tha's \u2014 tha's righ' nice of him, that is, an' not turnin' yeh in ei-ther. I've never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. .. . Comin' ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well. . . he\u2019d've liked that, Aragog would. . . .\" \n: \nHarry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he pro-vided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid's hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled. \n  \n\"Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?\" \n  \n\"Jus' beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,\" said Hagrid in a choked voice. \"I've already dug the \u2014 yeh know \u2014 grave. Jus' thought we'd say a few nice things over him \u2014 happy memories, yeh know \u2014\" \n  \nHis voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat. \n  \n\"Hagrid,\" he said, in a deep, grave voice. \"So very sorry to hear of your loss.\" \n  \n\"Tha's very nice of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Thanks a lot. An' thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither. . . .\" \n  \n\"Wouldn't have dreamed of it,\" said Slughorn. \"Sad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?\" \n  \n\"Out here,\" said Hagrid in a shaking voice. \"Shall we \u2014 shall we do it, then?\" \n  \nThe three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid's window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot- high mound of freshly dug earth. \n  \n\"Magnificent,\" said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head. \n  \n\"", ". well . . . one of us has to go and find Umbridge and - and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her - I don't know - that Peeves is up to something awful as usual . . .'\n    'I'll do it,' said Ron at once. 'I'll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it's miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way.'\n    It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.\n    'OK,' she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace. 'Now, we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin's bound to go and tip her off.\n    'Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\" said Ginny promptly, 'and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garrotting Gas.' Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, 'Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.'\n    'OK,' said Hermione. 'Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we'll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius - '\n    'He's not there, Hermione!'\n    'I mean, you can - can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don't think you should be in there alone, Lee's already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it.'\n    Even through his anger and impatience, Harry recognised Hermione's offer to accompany him into Umbridge's office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.\n    'I . . . OK, thanks,' he muttered.\n    'Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don't think we're going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,' said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, 'not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.'\n    'Five minutes'll be enough,' said Harry 'C'mon, let's go - '\n    'Now?' said Hermione, looking shocked.\n    'Of course now!' said Harry angrily. 'What did you think, we're going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!'\n    'I - oh, all right,' she said desperately. 'You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we'll meet you at the end of Umbridge's corridor, OK?'\n    Harry didn't answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius's knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them.\n    'Harry, d'you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky - '\n    But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor.\n    'Got it,' he panted. 'Ready to go, then?'\n    All right, whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them. 'So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off . . . Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor . . . Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear . . .\"\n    Ron strode away, his bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginny's equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by. Luna's blonde one.\n    'Get over here,' muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry's wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. 'Are - are you sure you're OK, Harry? You're still very pale.'\n    'I'm fine,' he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery . . .\n    'Here,' he said; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them.\n    'You can't come down here!' Ginny was calling to the crowd. 'No, sorry, you're going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase, someone's let off Garrotting Gas just along here - '\n    They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, 'I can't see no gas.'\n    That's because it's colourless,' said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, 'but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn't believe us.'\n    Slowly, the crowd thinned. The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people were not coming this way any more. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, 'I think that's as good as we're going to get, Harry - cone on, let's do it.'\n    They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, 'Good one . . . don't forget the signal.'\n    'What's the signal?' muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge's door.\n    'A loud chorus of \"Weasley is our King\" if they see Umbridge coming,' replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius's knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open and they entered the office.\n    The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.\n    'I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler.'\n    They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried, 'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!'\n    His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.\n    There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room.\n    'Sirius?' he shouted. 'Sirius, are you there?'\n    His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the tire.\n    'Who's there?' he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.\n    Kreacher the house-elf crept into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.\n    'It's the Potter boys head in the fire,' Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry", ".\n    'Quickly, quickly!' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. 'Ah, she's left it open - '\n    Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\n    'Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last . . . they've had it coming to them for years . . .'\n    He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\n    Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\n    One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\n    It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\n    'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\n    just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\n    'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\n    Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\n    'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting . . . oh, let me do it now . . .'\n    'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\n    'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\n    He turned to his twin.\n    'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\n    'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\n    Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\n    'Definitely,' said George.\n    And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\n    'Accio brooms!'\n    Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\n    'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\n    'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\n    Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\n    'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice. 'Our new premises!'\n    'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\n    'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\n    'Give her hell from us, Peeves.'\n    And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.\n- CHAPTER THIRTY -\nGrawp\nThe story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently heard students saying things like, 'Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,' or else, 'One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.'\n    Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.\n    Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.\n    Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.\n    Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.\n    Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit", "be sympathetic rather than critical.\n    'Here,' she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him, 'soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help.'\n    Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, then leapt into his lap and settled down.\n    Thanks,' he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand.\n    'I still reckon you should complain about this,' said Ron in a low voice.\n    'No,' said Harry flatly.\n    'McGonagall would go nuts if she knew - '\n    'Yeah, she probably would,' said Harry dully. 'And how long do you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?'\n    Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he closed it again, defeated.\n    'She's an awful woman,' said Hermione in a small voice. 'Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.'\n    'I suggested poison,' said Ron grimly.\n    'No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any Defence from her at all,' said Hermione.\n    'Well, what can we do about that?' said Ron, yawning. \"S too late, isn't it? She's got the job, she's here to stay. Fudge'll make sure of that.'\n    'Well,' said Hermione tentatively. 'You know, I was thinking today . . .' she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, 'I was thinking that - maybe the time's come when we should just - just do it ourselves.'\n    'Do what ourselves?' said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles.\n    'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione.\n    'Come off it,' groaned Ron. 'You want us to do extra work? D'you realise Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?'\n    'But this is much more important than homework!' said Hermione.\n    Harry and Ron goggled at her.\n    'I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework!' said Ron.\n    'Don't be silly, of course there is,' said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her. 'It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting for us out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year - '\n    'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron in a defeated voice. 'I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose - '\n    'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione. 'We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.'\n    'If you're talking about Lupin . . .' Harry began.\n    'No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,' said Hermione. 'He's too busy with the Order and, anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.'\n    'Who, then?' said Harry, frowning at her.\n    Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.\n    'Isn't it obvious?' she said. 'I'm talking about you, Harry.'\n    There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the fire guttered.\n    'About me what?' said Harry.\n    'I'm talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts.'\n    Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.\n    He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, 'That's an idea.'\n    'What's an idea?' said Harry.\n    'You,' said Ron. Teaching us to do it.'\n    'But . . .'\n    Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.\n    'But I'm not a teacher, I can't - '\n    'Harry, you're the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione.\n    'Me?' said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever. 'No I'm rot, you've beaten me in every test - '\n    'Actually I haven't,' said Hermione coolly. 'You beat me in our turd year - the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Think what you've clone!'\n    'How d'you mean?'\n    'You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,' Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry.\n    'Let's think,' he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. 'Uh . . . first year - you saved the Philosopher's Stone from You-Know-Who.'\n    'But that was luck,' said Harry, 'it wasn't skill - '\n    'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'\n    'Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up, I - '\n    Third year,' said Ron, louder still, 'you fought off about a hundred Dementors at once - '\n    'You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't - '\n    'Last year,' Ron said, almost shouting now, 'you fought off You-know-Who again - '\n    'Listen to me!' said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. 'Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck - I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help - '\n    Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry.\n    'Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?' he said heatedly. 'I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defence Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because - because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right - but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing - 'STOP LAUGHING!'\n    The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa. Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished.\n    'You don't know what it's like! You - neither of you - you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you're sure you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - 'like you can think straight when you know you're about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die - 'they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that - and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up - you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me -'", "ed windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \n\"Ha!\" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. \n\"Oh good,\" said Hermione, delighted. \"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \n\"Are you mad?\" said Harry. \"I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out \u2014\" \nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, \"Dijjindo!\" The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, \"Reparo!\" \nThere sat the Prince's copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand. \n\"I'll give Slughorn back the new one, he can't complain, it cost nine Galleons.\" \nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disap-proving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day's copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page. \n\"Anyone we know dead?\" asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper. \n\"No, but there have been more dementor attacks,\" said Hermi-one. \"And an arrest.\" \n\"Excellent, who?\" said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. \"Stan Shunpike,\" said Hermione. \n\"What?\" said Harry, startled. \n\"'Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding con-veyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .'\" \n\"Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?\" said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. \"No way!\" \n\"He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\" said Ron reasonably. \"You never can tell.\" \n\"It doesn't look like it,\" said Hermione, who was still reading. \"It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters' secret plans in a pub.\" She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. \"If he was under the Imperius Curse, he'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?\" \n\"It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\" said Ron. \"Isn't he the one who claimed he was going to be-come Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?\" \n\"Yeah, that's him,\" said Harry. \"I dunno what they're playing at, taking Stan seriously.\" \n\"They probably want to look as though they're doing some-thing,\" said Hermione, frowning. \"People are terrified \u2014 you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.\" \n\"What!\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \"But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We've got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we've got Dumbledore!\" \n\"I don't think we've got him all the time,\" said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. \"Haven't you noticed? His seat's been empty as often as Hagrid's this past week.\" \nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster's chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago. \n\"I think he's left the school to do something with the Order,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"I mean . . . it's all looking serious, isn't it?\" \nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since. \nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering to-gether, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, re-membering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck. \nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express. \n\"We met on the train, in old Sluggy's compartment,\" he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry's hand. \"Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.\" \n\"You didn't try out last year, did you?\" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving. \n\"I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\" said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \"Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.\" \n\"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well. . . if you wait over there ...\" He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermi-one was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and wondered whether McLaggen expected pref-erential treatment because they were both \"old Sluggy's\" favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts. \nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else. \nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs. \n\"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor,\" roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, \"leave now, please! \nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter. \n", "unk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth.\n\u3000\u3000\"So. . . found out about the dragons, have you?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hesitated. He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric, and he certainly wasn't going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right,\" said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \"Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I didn't cheat,\" said Harry sharply. \"It was - a sort of accident that I found out.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody grinned. \"I wasn't accusing you, laddie. I've been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won't be. They'll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win.\n\u3000\u3000They want to beat Dumbledore. They'd like to prove he's only human.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.\n\u3000\u3000\"So. . . got any ideas how you're going to get past your dragon yet?\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I'm not going to tell you,\" said Moody gruffly. \"I don't show favoritism, me.\n\u3000\u3000I'm just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is - play to your strengths.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I haven't got any,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Excuse me,\" growled Moody, \"you've got strengths if I say you've got them. Think now. What are you best at?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really -- \"Quidditch,\" he said dully, \"and a fat lot of help -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That's right,\" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \"You're a damn good flier from what I've heard.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but.. .\" Harry stared at him. \"I'm not allowed a broom, I've only got my wand...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"My second piece of general advice,\" said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \"is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, boy. . .\" whispered Moody. \"Put them together... it's not that difficult...\"\n\u3000\u3000And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed - \"Hermione,\" Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \"Hermione - I need you to help me.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I've been trying to do, Harry?\" she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\u3000\u3000And so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him.\n\u3000\u3000He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you think I'm trying to do?\" said Harry angrily. \"A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason...Okay, try again. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's good,\" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, \"just as long as it's not drawn-out. I don't want to suffer.\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry's eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care.\n\u3000\u3000He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid.\n\u3000\u3000He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.\n\u3000\u3000At two o'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville's toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.\n\u3000\u3000\"That's better, Harry, that's loads better,\" Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell,\" Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, \"threaten me with a dragon.\n\u3000\u3000Right...\" He raised his wand once more. \"Accio Dictionary!\"\n\u3000\u3000The heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, I really think you've got it!\" said Hermione delightedly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Just as long as it works tomorrow,\" Harry said. \"The Firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and I'm going to be out there on the grounds. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That doesn't matter,\" said Hermione firmly.\" Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep.. . you're going to need it.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons' enclosure - though of course, they didn't yet know what they would find there.\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing \"We'll have a box of tissues ready, Potter\" as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight.\n\u3000\u3000Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch.. . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall.\n\u3000\u3000Lots of people were watching.\n\u3000\u3000\"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now... . You have to get ready for your first task.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.", "did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.\n\"Molly and Arthur are on their way,\" she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. \"Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he - when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some -\" \"Snape killed Dumbledore,\" said Harry.\nShe stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.\n\"Snape,\" repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. \"We all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape... I can't believe it. ...\"\n\"Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,\" said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. \"We always knew that.\"\n\"But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!\" whispered Tonks. \"I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn't. ...\" .\n\"He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,\" muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. \"I mean . . . with Snapes history ... of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape's repentance was absolutely genuine-----Wouldn't hear a word against him!\"\n\"I'd love to know what Snape told him to convince him,\" said Tonks.\n\"I know,\" said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. \"Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead.\"\nThey all stared at him.\n\"And Dumbledore believed that?\" said Lupin incredulously. \"Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . .\"\n\"And he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either,\" said Harry, \"because she was Muggle-born... 'Mudblood,' he called her. ...\"\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.\n\"This is all my fault,\" said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. \"My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn't alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don't think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don't think he knew they were coming.\"\n\"It isn't your fault, Minerva,\" said Lupin firmly. \"We all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way....\"\n\"So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters' side?\" asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\n\"I don't know exactly how it happened,\" said Professor McGonagall distractedly. \"It's all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .\"\n\"I do,\" said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. \"So they got in through the Room of Requirement.\"\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\n\"I messed up, Harry,\" said Ron bleakly. \"We did like you told us: We checked the Marauder's Map and we couldn't see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it... but Malfoy got past us.\"\n\"He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,\" said Ginny. \"He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -\"\n\"His Hand of Glory,\" said Ron. \"Gives light only to the holder, remember?\"\n\"Anyway,\" Ginny went on, \"he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -\"\n\"- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,\" said Ron bitterly. \"Fred and George's. I'm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.\"\n\"We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,\" said Ginny. \"Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn't dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we'd reached a corridor that was light, they'd gone.\"\n\"Luckily,\" said Lupin hoarsely, \"Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn't expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -\"\n\"To set off the Mark?\" asked Harry.\n\"He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,\" said Lupin. \"But I don't think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.\"\n\"So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,\" said Harry, turning to Hermione, \"were you - ?\"\n\"Outside Snape's office, yes,\" whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, \"with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn't know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map-----It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don't think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape's office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -\" \"What?\" Harry urged her.\n\"I was so stupid, Harry!\" said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. \"He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -\" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. \"We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, it's so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn't realize, Harry, we didn", "pet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure all the: portraits around the room were listening closely to every wore! Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been, and why there had been injuries.\n    'I know how you're feeling, Harry,' said Dumbledore very quietly.\n    'No, you don't,' said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings.\n    'You see, Dumbledore?' said Phineas Nigellus slyly. 'Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own - '\n    That's enough, Phineas,' said Dumbledore.\n    Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play . . . he had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been . . . Harry had never asked him . . .\n    There  is  no  shame   in  what  you  are   feeling,  Harry,'  said Dumbledore's voice. 'On the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.'\n    Harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words.\n    'My greatest strength, is it?' said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. 'You haven't got a clue . . . you don't know . . .\"\n    'What don't I know?' asked Dumbledore calmly.\n    It was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.\n    'I don't want to talk about how I feel, all right?'\n    'Harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human - '\n    'THEN - I - DON'T - WANT - TO - BE - HUMAN!' Harry roared, and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room; it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, 'Really!'\n    'I DON'T CARE!' Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. 'I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANY MORE - '\n    He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.\n    'You do care,' said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. 'You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.'\n    'I - DON'T!' Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself.\n    'Oh, yes, you do,' said Dumbledore, still more calmly. 'You have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.'\n    'YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL!' Harry roared. 'YOU - STANDING THERE - YOU - '\n    But words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He turned on his heel and ran to the door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it.\n    But the door would not open.\n    Harry turned back to Dumbledore.\n    'Let me out,' he said. He was shaking from head to foot.\n    'No,' said Dumbledore simply.\n    For a few seconds they stared at each other.\n    'Let me out,' Harry said again.\n    'No,' Dumbledore repeated.\n    'If you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don't let me - '\n    'By all means continue destroying my possessions,' said Dumbledore serenely. 'I daresay I have too many.'\n    He walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching Harry.\n    'Let me out,' Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore's.\n    'Not until I have had my say,' said Dumbledore.\n    'Do you - do you think I want to - do you think I give a - I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY!' Harry roared. 'I don't want to hear anything you've got to say!'\n    'You will,' said Dumbledore steadily. 'Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.'\n    'What are you talking - ?'\n    'It is my fault that Sirius died,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'Or should I say, almost entirely my fault - I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.'\n    Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.\n    'Please sit down,' said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.\n    Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood, and took the seat facing Dumbledore's desk.\n    'Am I to understand,' said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry's left, 'that my great-great-grandson - the last of the Blacks - is dead?'\n    'Yes, Phineas,' said Dumbledore.\n    'I don't believe it,' said Phineas brusquely.\n    Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house . . .\n    'Harry, I owe you an explanation,' said Dumbledore. 'An explanation of an old man's mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have forgotten, lately . . .'\n    The sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace.\n    'I guessed, fifteen years ago,' said Dumbledore, 'when I saw the scar on your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.'\n    'You've told me this before, Professor,' said Harry bluntly. He did not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much any more.\n    'Yes,' said Dumbledore apologetically. 'Yes", "nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dog-breath and Dung-head. \n'Happy birthday, Ron,' said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. 'Have a present.' \nHe threw the package across on to Ron's bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night. \n'Cheers,' said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rum-maging in it for the Marauder's Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis. \n'Right,' he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tap-ping it quietly and murmuring, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear. \n'Nice one, Harry!' said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper's gloves Harry had given him. \n'No problem,' said Harry absent-mindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. 'Hey ... I don't think he's in his bed ...' \nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure. \n'Seriously good haul this year!' he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. 'See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I'll come of age next year too ... \n'Cool,' muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast ... he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study ... he wasn't in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing ... \n'Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons. \n'No thanks,' said Harry, looking up. 'Malfoy's gone again!' \n'Can't have done,' said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. 'Come on. if you don't hurry up you'll have to Apparate on an empty-stomach ... might make it easier, 1 suppose ...\" \nRon looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third. \nHarry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, 'Mischief managed,' though it hadn't been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy's periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon, \n'Ready?' he said to Ron. \nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely un-focused look on his face. \n'Ron? Breakfast.' \n'I'm not hungry,' \nHarry stared ai him. \n'I thought you just said -?' \n-Well, all right, I'll come down with you,' sighed Ron, 'but I don't want to eat.' \nHarry scrutinised him suspiciously. \n'You've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven't you?' \n'It's not that,' Ron sighed again. 'You ... you wouldn't understand.' \n'Fair enough,' said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door. \n'Harry!' said Ron suddenly. \n'What?' \n'Harry, I can't stand it!' \n'You can't stand what?' asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick. \n'I can't stop thinking about her!' said Ron hoarsely. \nHarry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav', he would have to pui his foot down. \n'Why does that stop you having breakfast?' Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. \n'I don't think she knows I exist,' said Ron with a desperate gesture. \n'She definitely knows you exist,' said Harry, bewildered. 'She keeps snogging you, doesn't she?' \nRon blinked. \n'Who are you talking about?' \nWho are you talking about?' said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation. \n'Romilda Vane,' said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, 'This is a joke, right? You're joking.' \nT think ... Harry, 1 ihink I love her,' said Ron in a strangled voice. \n'OK,' said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, 'OK ... say that again with a straight face.' \n'I love her,' repeated Ron breathlessly. 'Have you seen her hair, it's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -' \n'This is really funny and everything,' said Harry impatiently, 'but joke's over, all right? Drop it.' \nHe turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ron's fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again. \nHarry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\icorpus!\nRon yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upside-down, his robes hanging off him. \n'What was that for?' Harry bellowed. \n'You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!' shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head. \n'This is insane!' said Harry. 'What's got into -?' \nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ron's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll. \n'Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?' \n'They were a birthday present!' shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. '1 offered you one, didn't 1?' \n'You just picked them up off the floor, didn't you?' \n'They'd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!' \n'They didn't fall off your bed, you prat, don't you under-stand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. They're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they're all spiked with love potion!' \nBut only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron. \n'Romilda?' he repeated. 'Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?' \nHarry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another p", "f hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three.\n    'All those poor elves I haven't set free yet, having to stay here over Christmas because there aren't enough hats!'\n    Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: :But you're coming too! Didn't I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!'\n    Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.\n    Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend: 'HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!'\n    Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual.\n    'Hello,' she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. These are nice, did you put them up?'\n    'No,' said Harry, 'it was Dobby the house-elf.'\n    'Mistletoe,' said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head. He jumped out from under it. 'Good thinking,' said Luna very seriously. 'It's often infested with Nargles.'\n    Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.\n    'Well,' said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, 'we've finally replaced you.'\n    'Replaced me?' said Harry blankly.\n    You and Fred and George,' she said impatiently. 'We've got another Seeker!'\n    'Who?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Ginny Weasley,' said Katie.\n    Harry gaped at her.\n    'Yeah, I know,' said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, 'but she's pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,' she said, throwing him a very dirty look, 'but as we can't have you . . .'\n    Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?\n    'And what about the Beaters? he asked, trying to keep his voice even.\n    'Andrew Kirke,' said Alicia without enthusiasm, 'and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up . . .'\n    The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina's burning, reproachful looks.\n    'OK,' he said, calling them all to order. 'I thought this evening we should just go over the things we've done so far, because it's the last meeting before the holidays and there's no poin: starting anything new right before a three-week break - '\n    'We're not doing anything new?' said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. 'If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come.'\n    'We're all really sorry Harry didn't tell you, then,' said Fred loudly.\n    Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\n    ' - we can practise in pairs,' said Harry. 'We'll start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.'\n    They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of intermittent cries of 'Impedimenta!' People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.\n    Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times.\n    After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over.\n    Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.\n    At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.\n    'You're getting really good,' he said, beaming around at them. 'When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff - maybe even Patronuses.'\n    There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a 'Happy Christmas' as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a 'Merry Christmas' from her.\n    'No, you go on,' he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam's apple.\n    He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.\n    He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.\n    'Wha-?'\n    He didn't know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying silently.\n    'What's up?' he said, feebly.\n    She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.\n    'I'm - sorry,' she said thickly. 'I suppose . . . it's just . . . learning all this stuff . . . it just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he'd known it all . . . he'd still be alive.'\n    Harry's heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk about Cedric.\n    'He did know this stuff,' Harry said heavily. '", "was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn't like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"It's slavery, that's what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn't anyone do something about it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, the elves are happy, aren't they?\" Ron said. \"You heard old Winky back at the match.. . 'House-elves is not supposed to have fun'. . . that's what she likes, being bossed around. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's people like you, Ron,\" Hermione began hotly, \"who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they're too lazy to -\"\n\u3000\u3000Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's just keep moving, shall we?\" said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn't there.\n\u3000\u3000They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\" one of them shouted. \"I'm a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No, you're not!\" yelled his friend. \"You're a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . . .\n\u3000\u3000but I'm a vampire hunter, I've killed about ninety so far -\"\n\u3000\u3000A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I'm about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron's face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \"Did I tell you I've invented a broomstick that'll reach Jupiter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We'll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\n\u3000\u3000The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\n\u3000\u3000Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\n\u3000\u3000They looked at one another, surprised.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well - there's a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Bagman stared at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .\n\u3000\u3000Bagman swore loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\n\u3000\u3000\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\n\u3000\u3000\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\"\n\u3000\u3000He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope the others are okay,\" said Hermione after a while.\n\u3000\u3000\"They'll be fine,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \"He's always said he'd like to get something on him.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"That'd wipe the smirk off old Draco's face, all right,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Those poor Muggles, though,\" said Hermione nervously. \"What if they can't get them down?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They will,\" said Ron reassuringly. \"They'll find a way.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic's out here tonight!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they've been drinking, or are they just -\"\n\u3000\u3000But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello?\" called Harry.\n\u3000\u3000There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's there?\" he said.\n\u3000\u3000And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.\n\u3000\u3000\"MORSMORDRE!\"\n\u3000\u3000And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.\n\u3000\u3000\"What the - ?\" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\n\u3000\u3000For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.\n\u3000\u3000Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn't understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn't see anyone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's there?\" he called again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, come on, move!\" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's the matter?\" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's the Dark Mark, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.\n\u3000\u3000\"You-Know-Who's sign!\"\n\u3000", "the Ministry of Magic . . . it must have been that one, it's too much of a coincidence!'\n    'How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he's on our side?' said Ron.\n    'Well, I don't know,' Hermione admitted. That is a bit odd . . .'\n    'So what's in the Department of Mysteries?' Harry asked Ron. 'Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?'\n    'I know they call the people who work in there \"Unspeakables\",' said Ron, frowning. 'Because no one really seems to know what they do - weird place to have a weapon.'\n    'It's not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,' said Hermione. 'It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect . . . Harry, are you sure you're all right?'\n    For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it.\n    'Yeah . . . fine . . .' he said, lowering his hands, which were trembling. 'I just feel a bit . . . I don't like Occlumency much.'\n    I expect anyone would feel snaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,' said Hermione sympathetically. 'Look, let's get back to the common room, we'll be a bit more comfortable there.'\n    But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.\n    'Headless Hats!' shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. Two Galleons each, watch Fred, now!'\n    Fred swept the hat on to his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid; then both hat and head vanished.\n    Several girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.\n    'And off again!' shouted George, and Fred's hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it.\n    'How do those hats work, then?' said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely. 'I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object . . . I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though.'\n    Harry did not answer; he was feeling ill.\n    'I'm going to have to do this tomorrow,' he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.\n    'Well, write it in your homework planner then!' said Hermione encouragingly. 'So you don't forget!'\n    Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively.\n    'Don't leave it till later, you big second-rater!' chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge's homework. Hermione beamed at it.\n    'I think I'll go to bed,' said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.\n    He walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys' dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.\n    He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where be was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own name.\n    Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears . . . he was happier than he had been in a very long time . . . jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant . . . a wonderful, wonderful thing had happened . . .\n    'Harry? HARRY!'\n    Someone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued . . .\n    He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realised this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.\n    'What happened?' he said.\n    'I . . . dunno . . .' Harry gasped, sitting up again. 'He's really happy . . . really happy . . .'\n    'You-Know-Who is?'\n    'Something good's happened,' mumbled Harry. He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr Weasley and felt very sick. 'Something he's been hoping for.'\n    The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time.\n    'Hermione told me to come and check on you,' said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. 'She says your defences will be low at the moment, after Snape's been fiddling around with your mind . . . still, I suppose it'll help in the long run, won't it?' He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him towards his bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully. He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind's resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years.\n- CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE -\nThe Beetle at Bay\nHarry's question was answered the very next morning. When Hermione's Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.\n    'What?' said Harry and Ron together.\n    For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.\n    Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.\n    Algernon Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He Who Must Not Be Named.\n    But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her beauty.\n    Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent mca-pacitation of Frank and Alice LongbotWm.\n    Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.\nMASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN\nMINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS 'RALLYING POINT'\nFOR OLD DEATH EATERS\n'Black?' said Harry loudly. 'Not - ?'\n    '", "- ah - frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,' Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, 'for the Order.'\n    It was Sirius's turn to flush. Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry.\n    The Headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.'\n    'Study what?' said Harry blankly.\n    Snape's sneer became more pronounced.\n    'Occlumency, Potter. The magical defence of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.'\n    Harry's heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defence against external penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that . . .\n    'Why do I have to study Occlu - thing?' he blurted out.\n    'Because the Headmaster thinks it a good idea,' said Snape smoothly. 'You will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'Who's going to be teaching me?'\n    Snape raised an eyebrow.\n    'I am,' he said.\n    Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting.\n    Extra lessons with Snape - what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly round at Sirius for support.\n    'Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?' asked Sirius aggressively. 'Why you?'\n    'I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,' said Snape silkily. 'I assure you I did not beg for the job.' He got to his feet. 'I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.'\n    He turned to leave, his black travelling cloak billowing behind him.\n    'Wait a moment,' said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.\n    Snape turned back to face them, sneering.\n    'I am in rather a hurry, Black. Unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time.'\n    'I'll get to the point, then,' said Sirius, standing up. He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. 'If I hear you're using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to.'\n    'How touching,' Snape sneered. 'But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?'\n    'Yes, I have,' said Sirius proudly.\n    'Well then, you'll know he's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,' Snape said sleekly.\n    Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards Snape, pulling out his wand as he went. Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius's wand-tip to his face.\n    'Sirius!' said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\n    'I've warned you, Snivelus,' said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape's, 'I don't care if Dumbledore thinks you've reformed, I know better - '\n    'Oh, but why don't you tell him so?' whispered Snape. 'Or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother's house for six months?'\n    Tell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he's delighted his lapdog's working at Hogwarts, isn't he?'\n    'Speaking of dogs,' said Snape softly, 'did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn't it?'\n    Sirius raised his wand.\n    'NO!' Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them. 'Sirius, don't!'\n    'Are you calling me a coward?' roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.\n    'Why, yes, I suppose I am,' said Snape.\n    'Harry - get - out - of - it!' snarled Sirius, pushing him aside with his free hand.\n    The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh.\n    'Cured!' he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. 'Completely cured!'\n    He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each other's faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each, trying to force them apart.\n    'Merlins beard,' said Mr Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, 'what's going on here?'\n    Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses. Snape piocketed his wand, turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he looked back.\n    'Six o'clock, Monday evening, Potter.'\n    And he was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.\n    'What's been going on?' asked Mr Weasley again.\n    'Nothing, Arthur,' said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance. 'Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends.' With what looked like an enormous effort, he smiled. 'So . . . you're cured? That's great news, really great.'\n    'Yes, isn't it?' said Mrs Weasley, leading her husband forward to a chair. 'Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake's got in its fangs, and Arthur's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven't you, dear?' she added, rather menacingly.\n    'Yes, Molly dear,' said Mr Weasley meekly.\n    That nights meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr Weasley back amongst them. Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr Weasley their congratulations. He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place. But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance. Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.\n    'Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,' said Hermione at once. Well, you won't be sorry not to have them any more, will you?'\n    'Extra lessons with Snape?' said Ron, sounding aghast. 'I'd rather have the nightmares!'\n    They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating", "\u3000\"Where are they sleeping, then?\" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them.\n\u3000\u3000A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione's reappearance with the box of S. P.\n\u3000\u3000E.W. badges.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh good, hurry up,\" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.\n\u3000\u3000As they neared Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knocked on Hagrid's door, and Fang's booming barks answered instantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Bout time!\" said Hagrid, when he'd flung open the door. \"Thought you lot'd forgotten where I live!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've been really busy, Hag -\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \"Erm - where are the skrewts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\" said Hagrid happily. \"They're get-tin' massive, mus' be\n\u3000\u3000nearly three foot long now. On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh no, really?\" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"S' okay, though, I've got 'em in separate boxes now. Still got abou' twenty.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, that's lucky,\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\n\u3000\u3000\"You wait,\" he said, grinning. \"You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before. Firs' task. . . ah, but I'm not supposed ter say.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Go on, Hagrid!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"But it's gonna be spectacular, I'll tell yeh that. Them champions're going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I'd live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\"\n\u3000\u3000They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn't eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.\n\u3000\u3000A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.\n\u3000\u3000\"It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione,\" he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \"It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\" said Hermione. \"And we heard he's asking for wages now!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it - no, nothin' doin', Hermione.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.\n\u3000\u3000By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll come with yeh,\" said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \"Jus' give us a sec.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn't pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \"Hagrid, what's that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Eh?\" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \"Don' yeh like it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Is that aftershave?\" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - eau de cologne,\" Hagrid muttered. He was blushing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe it's a bit much,\" he said gruffly. \"I'll go take it off, hang on...\"\n\u3000\u3000He stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eau de cologne?\" said Hermione in amazement. \"Hagrid?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And what's with the hair and the suit?\" said Harry in an undertone.\n\u3000\u3000\"Look!\" said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window. Hagrid had just straightened up and turned 'round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn't spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn't hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame\n\u3000\u3000Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before -when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's going up to the castle with her!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"I thought he was waiting for us!\"\n\u3000\u3000Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beaux-batons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\n\u3000\u3000\"He fancies her!\" said Ron incredulously. \"Well, if they end up having children, they'll be setting a world record - bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\"\n\u3000\u3000They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ooh it's them, look!\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle", "was moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry -- at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did he get you?\" Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, \"missed.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"LEAVE IT!\" Moody shouted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Leave - what?\" Harry said, bewildered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not you - him!\" Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody's rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.\n\u3000\u3000Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't think so!\" roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned,\" growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \"Stinking, cowardly, scummy\n\u3000\u3000thing to do...\"\n\u3000\u3000The ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Never - do - that - again -\" said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody!\" said a shocked voice.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Professor McGonagall,\" said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.\n\u3000\u3000\"What - what are you doing?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret's progress through the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Teaching,\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"Teach - Moody, is that a student?\" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yep,\" said Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!\" said Professor McGonagall wealdy.\n\u3000\u3000\"Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He might've mentioned it, yeah,\" said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, \"but I thought a good sharp shock -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender's Head of House!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll do that, then,\" said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.\n\u3000\u3000Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words \"my father\" were distinguishable.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yeah?\" said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall. \"Well, I know your father of old, boy... . You tell him Moody's keeping a close eye on his son. . . you tell him that from me. . . . Now, your Head of House'll be Snape, will it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Malfoy resentfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Another old friend,\" growled Moody. \"I've been looking forward to a chat with old Snape.\n\u3000\u3000. . . Come on, you. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000And he seized Malfoy's upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't talk to me,\" Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why not?\" said Hermione in surprise.\n\u3000\u3000\"Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,\" said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. \"Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.\n\u3000\u3000\"He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,\" she said. \"It was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione!\" said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, \"you're ruining the best moment of my life!\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't tell me you're going back to the library this evening?\" said Harry, watching her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Got to,\" said Hermione thickly. \"Loads to do.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But you told us Professor Vector -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's not schoolwork,\" she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody!\" he said. \"How cool is he?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Beyond cool,\" said George, sitting down opposite Fred. \"Supercool,\" said the twins' best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. \"We had him this afternoon,\" he told Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was it like?\" said Harry eagerly.\n\u3000\u3000Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.\n\u3000\u3000\"Never had a lesson like it,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"He knows, man,\" said Lee.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knows what?\" said Ron, leaning forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"Knows what it's like to be out there doing it,\" said George impressively.\n\u3000\u3000\"Doing what?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fighting the Dark Arts,\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's seen it all,\" said George.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mazing,\" said Lee.\n\u3000\u3000Ron dived into his bag for his schedule.\n\u3000\u3000\"We haven't got him till Thursday!\" he said in a disappointed voice.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER FOURTEEN - THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES\n\u3000\u3000The next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.\n\u3000\u3000\"You know why Snape's in such a foul mood, don't you?\" said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Moody.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it - but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together -at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors - he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye, whether magical or normal.\n\u3000\u3000\"I reckon Snape's a bit scared of him, you know,\" Harry said thoughtfully.\n\u3000\u3000\"Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\" said Ron, his eyes misting over, \"and bounced him all around his dungeon...\"\n\u3000\u3000The Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody's first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the", ".\n\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks\n205\nheaving and sweaty.\n\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\n\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read\nwhat is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\nHarry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n\"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\"\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n206\n\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\n\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\"\n\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\nFirenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\"\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\n\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?\"\n\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\nenough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"\n\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who --\"\n\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's\nheart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\"\n\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\n\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n207\nbehind her.\n\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.\"\n\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\nHarry slid off his back.\n\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\"\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\nHarry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\nrich....\"\n\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\nHarry wasn't listening.\n\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written\nin the stars as well.\"\n\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\n\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry\n208\nwent on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.\"\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\nand Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.\"\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\nJust in case.\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\na desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if\nit had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\n209\nhis old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\nMaybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because", "'How did you get out of that?' asked Harry.\n    'Wouldn'ta done if Olympe hadn' bin there,' said Hagrid. 'She pulled out her wand an' did some o' the fastes' spellwork I've ever seen. Ruddy marvellous. Hit the two holdin' me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an' they dropped me straightaway - 'bu' we were in trouble then, 'cause we'd used magic against 'em, an' that's what giants hate abou' wizards. We had ter leg it an' we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again.'\n    'Blimey, Hagrid,' said Ron quietly.\n    'So, how come it's taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?' asked Hermione.\n    'We didn' leave after three days!' said Hagrid, looking outraged. 'Dumbledore was relyin' on us!'\n    'But you've just said there was no way you could go back!'\n    'Not by daylight we couldn', no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o' days lyin' low up in the cave an' watchin'. An' wha' we saw wasn' good.'\n    'Did he rip off more heads?' asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.\n    'No,' said Hagrid, 'I wish he had.'\n    'What d'you mean?'\n    'I mean we soon found out he didn' object ter all wizards - 'just us.'\n    'Death Eaters?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Yep,' said Hagrid darkly. 'Couple oi 'em were visitin' him ev'ry clay, bringin' gifts ter the Gurg, an' he wasn' dangling them upside - 'c.own.'\n    'How d'you know they were Death Eaters?' said Ron.\n    'Because I recognised one of 'em,' Hagrid growled. 'Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. L.ikes killin' as much as Golgomath; no wonder they were gettin' on so well.'\n    'So Macnair's persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?' said Hermione desperately.\n    'Hold yer Hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!' said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. 'Me an' Olympe talked it over an' we agreed, jus' 'cause the Gurg looked like favourin' You-Know-Who didn' mean all of 'em would. We had ter try an' persuade some o' the others, the ones who hadn' wanted Golgomath as Gurg.'\n    'How could you tell which ones they were?' asked Ron.\n    Well, they were the ones bein' beaten to a pulp, weren' they?' said Hagrid patiently. The ones with any sense were keepin' outta Golgomath's way, hidin' out in caves roun' the gully jus' like we were. So we decided we'd go pokin' round the caves by night an' see if we couldn' persuade a few o' them.'\n    'You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?' said Ron, with awed respect in his voice.\n    Well, it wasn' the giants who worried us most,' said Hagrid. 'We were more concerned abou' the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen' not ter tangle with 'em if we could avoid it, an' the trouble was they knew we was around - 'spect Golgomath told 'em abou' us. At night, when the giants were sleepin' an' we wanted ter be creepin' inter the caves, Macnair an' the other one were sneakin' round the mountains lookin' fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at 'em,' said Hagrid, the corners of h s mouth lifting his wild beard, 'she was rarin' ter attack 'em . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe . . . fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . .'\n    Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.\n    'So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?'\n    'What? Oh . . . oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in an' headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go - then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'.'\n    'Cave must've been cramped,' said Ron.\n    'Wasn' room ter swing a Kneazle,' said Hagrid.\n    'Didn't they attack you when they saw you?' asked Hermione.\n    'Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, 'but they was badly hurt, all three o' them; Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'.'\n    'Six or seven?' said Ron eagerly. 'Well that's not bad - are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?'\n    But Hermione said, 'What do you mean \"at one point\", Hagrid?'\n    Hagrid looked at her sadly.\n    'Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that.'\n    'So . . . so there aren't any giants coming?' said Ron, looking disappointed.\n    'Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, 'but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em . . . could be they'll come.'\n    Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap.\n    'Hagrid?' said Hermione quietly after a while.\n    'Mmm?'\n    'Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything asout your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?'\n    Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared.\n    'I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it - '\n    'Dead,' Hagrid grunted. 'Died years ago. They told me.'\n    'Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,' said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders.\n    'No need,' he said shortly. 'Can't remember her much. Wasn' a great mother.'\n    They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.\n    'But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,' Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face.\n    'Or why you're back so late,' said Harry. 'Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago - '\n    'Who attacked you?' said Ron.\n    'I haven' bin attacked!' said Hagrid emphatically. 'I - '\n    But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione g", "..;. \nThe bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. \"Sir,\" Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could. \n  \n\"Professor \u2014 Professor, don't you want to taste my po \u2014 ?\" called Harry desperately. \n  \nBut Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-dron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room. \n  \nRon and Hermione returned in the late afternoon. \n  \n\"Harry!\" cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. \"Harry, I passed!\" \n- \n\"Well done!\" he said. \"And Ron?\" \n  \n\"He \u2014 he just failed,\" whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. \"It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he'd left half an eyebrow behind. . . How did it go with Slughorn?\" \n  \n\"No joy,\" said Harry, as Ron joined them. \"Bad luck, mate, but you'll pass next time \u2014 we can take it together.\" \n  \n\"Yeah, I s'pose,\" said Ron grumpily. \"But half an eyebrow \u2013 like that matters!\" \n  \n\"I know,\" said Hermione soothingly, \"it does seem really harsh. ...\" \n  \nThey spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory. \n  \n\"So, Harry \u2014 you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?\" Ron demanded. \n  \n\"Yeah, I s'pose I'd better,\" said Harry. \"I don't reckon I'll need all of it, not twenty-four hours' worth, it can't take all night.... I'll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.\" \n  \n\"It's a great feeling when you take it,\" said Ron reminiscently. \"Like you can't do anything wrong.\" \n  \n\"What are you talking about?\" said Hermione, laughing. \"You've never taken any!\" \n  \n\"Yeah, but I thought I had, didn't I?\" said Ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. \"Same difference really ...\" \n  \nAs they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbid-den Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-ing carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys' dormitory. \n  \nHarry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle. \n  \n\"Well, here goes,\" said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp. \n  \n\"What does it feel like?\" whispered Hermione. \n  \nHarry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all... and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy. . . . \n  \nHe got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence. \n\"Excellent,\" he said. \"Really excellent. Right. . . I'm going down to Hagrid's.\" \n  \n\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast. \n  \n\"No, Harry \u2014 you've got to go and see Slughorn, remember?\" said Hermione. \n  \n\"No,\" said Harry confidently. \"I'm going to Hagrid's, I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.\" \n  \n\"You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?\" asked Ron, looking stunned. \n  \n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \"I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?\" \n  \n\"No,\" said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now. \n  \n\"This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?\" said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. \"You haven't got another little bottle full of\u2014 I don't know \u2014\" \n  \n\"Essence of Insanity?\" suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders. \n  \nHarry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed. \n  \n\"Trust me,\" he said. \"I know what I'm doing ... or at least\" he strolled confidently to the door\u2014 \"Felix does.\" \n  \nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door. \n  \n\"What were you doing up there with her!\u201d shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories. Harry heard Ron splutter-ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them. \n  \nGetting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny. \n  \n\"Don't push me, please, Dean,\" she said, sounding annoyed. ; \"You're always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. ...\" \n  \nThe portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation in-creasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts. \n  \nWhy he knew that going to Hagrid's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the en-trance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk. \n  \nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid's. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked be-hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation. \n  \n\"I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,\" Slughorn was saying courteously, \"most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.\" \n  \n\"Oh, I quite agree,\" said Professor Sprout warmly. \"That enough for you?\" \n  \n\"Plenty, plenty,\" said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. \"This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!\" \n  \nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible. \n: \nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish. \n  \n\"Good evening, Professor.\" \n  \n\"Merlin\u2019s be", "Ls from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.\n    She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.\n    'How many hours d'you think you're doing a day?' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.\n    'I dunno,' said Ron. 'A few.'\n    'More or less than eight?'\n    'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.\n    'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. 'Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday - '\n    Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.\n    Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.\n    'Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, 'it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years - old Griselda Marchbanks - we've had her round for dinner and everthing . . .'\n    'Do you think that's true?' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron.\n    'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily.\n    'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them. 'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's.'\n    'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict?'\n    'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice.\n    'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it?' Ron told him encouragingly.\n    'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad . . . well . . . you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\n    Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.\n    Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\n    'Hermione, we wanted to buy that!' shouted Ron.\n    'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it.'\n    'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw?' said Ron eagerly.\n    'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.'\n    'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '\n    This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly. 'I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried Doxy droppings.'\n    This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants.\n    They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson.\n    'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.\n    'Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new - Headmistress - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt '- has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - '\n    Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.\n    ' - however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.'\n    'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'\n    'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall.\n    'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays.'\n    Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought dully', at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer.\n    Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.\n    'Why don't you just do it yourself?' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.\n    Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.\n    Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate", "break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.\"\nThey returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.\n\"I thought you'd get that, well done,\" she called over, pointing. at the Captains badge on Harry's chest. \"Tell me when you call trials!\"\n\"Don't be stupid,\" said Harry, \"you don't need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .\"\n\"You mustn't start off like that,\" she said warningly. \"For all you know, there's someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends. ...\"\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks's yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.\n\"We got so much homework for Runes,\" she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. \"A fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I've got to read these by Wednesday!\"\n\"Shame,\" yawned Ron. \n\"You wait,\" she said resentfully. \"I bet Snape gives us loads.\" \nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n\"Inside,\" he said.\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\"\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \n\"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" \nYou believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \nNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.WL. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.\"\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. The Dark Arts,\" said Snape, \"are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\"\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the\nDark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\n\"Your defenses,\" said Snape, a little louder, \"must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo. These pictures - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - \"give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - \"feel the Dementor's Kiss\" - a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall - \"or provoke the aggression of the Inferius\" - a bloody mass upon ground.\n\"Has an Inferius been seen, then?\" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. \"Is it definite, is he using them?\"\n\"The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\" said Snape, \"which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . \" \nHe set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,\n\". . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\"\nHermione's hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \"Very well - Miss Granger?\"\n\"Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you're about to perform,\" said Hermione, \"which gives you a split-second advantage.\"\n\"An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\" said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \"but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\" -\nhis gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - \"lack.\" \nHarry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away. \n\"You will now divide,\" Snape went on, \"into pairs. One partner will attempt jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\"\nAlthough Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville's muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He\nswept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.\nRon, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting\non tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\n\"Pathetic, Weasley,\" said Snape, after a while. \"Here -- let me show you -\"\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \"Protego!\"\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.\n\"Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.\" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however , Ron, Dean, and Seam us grinned appreciatively.\n\"Detention, Saturday night, my office,\" said Snape. \"I do not take cheek from anyone, Pot", "bounced, and shrieked; Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters: \n  \nWHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT \nYOU-KNOW-WHO? \nYOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT \nU-NO-POO-- \nTHE CONSTIPATION SENSATION \nTHAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION! \n  \nHarry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name \"U-No-Poo.\" \n  \n\"They'll be murdered in their beds!\" she whispered. \n  \n\"No they won\u2019t!\" said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. \"This is brilliant!\" \n  \nAnd he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: reusable hangman \u2014 spell it or he'll swing! \n  \n\"'Patented Daydream Charms \n  \nHermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship. \n  \n\"'One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens. You know,\" said Hermione, looking up at Harry, \"that really is extraordinary magic!\" \n  \n\"For that, Hermione,\" said a voice behind them, \"you can have one for free.\" \n  \nA beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair. \n  \n\"How are you, Harry?\" They shook hands. \"And what's happened to your eye, Hermione?\" \n  \n\"Your punching telescope,\" she said ruefully. \n  \n\"Oh blimey, I forgot about those,\" said Fred. \"Here \u2014\" \n  \nHe pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste. \n  \n\"Just dab it on, that bruise'll be gone within the hour,\" said Fred. \"We had to find a decent bruise remover. We're testing most of our products on ourselves.\" \n  \nHermione looked nervous. \"It is safe, isn't it?\" she asked. \n  \n'\"Course it is,\" said Fred bracingly. \"Come on, Harry, I'll give you a tour.\" \n  \nHarry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks. \n  \n\"Muggle magic tricks!\" said Fred happily, pointing them out. \"For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It's not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they're great novelties. . . . Oh, here's George. ...\" \n  \nFred's twin shook Harrys hand energetically. \n  \n\"Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that's where we're making the real money\u2014pocket anything, you, and you'll pay in more than Galleons!\" he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark \n  \nMARKS----THEY'LL MAKE ANYONE SICK! \n  \nGeorge pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued. \n  \n\"We've just developed this more serious line,\" said Fred. \"Funny how it happened . . .\" \n  \n\"You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,\" said George. \"'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry.\" \n  \n\"That's right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!\" \n  \n\"So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves ...\" \n  \n\"... I mean, they wouldn't help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . .\" \n  \n\"And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner,\" continued George enthusiastically. \"This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we're importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make \n  \na quick escape.\" \n  \n\"And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. \"You just drop one surreptitiously and it'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one. \n  \n\"Handy,\" said Harry, impressed. \n  \n\"Here,\" said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry. \n  \nA young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes. \n  \n\"There's a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,\" she said. \n  \nHarry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called \"Mr. Weasley,\" but they took it in their stride. \n  \n\"Right you are, Verity, I'm coming,\" said George promptly. \"Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.\" \n  \n\"I can't do that!\" said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators. \n  \n\"You don't pay here,\" said Fred firmly, waving away Harry's gold. \n  \n\"But\u2014\" \n  \n\"You gave us our start-up loan, we haven't forgotten,\" said George sternly \"Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.\" \n  \nGeorge swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms. \n  \n\"Haven't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?\" asked Fred. \"Follow me, ladies. . . .\" \n  \nNear the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary. \n  \n\"There you go,\" said Fred proudly. \"Best range of love potions you'll find anywhere.\" \n  \nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. \"Do they work?\" she asked. ", "this?' Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face. 'So she can speak freely?'\n    'I have not yet managed to find one,' Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione's jinxing ability 'But it doesn't matter if she won't speak, I can take up the story from here.\n    'You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade - '\n    'And what is your evidence for that?' cut in Professor McGonagall\n    'I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly 'He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - '\n    'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!' said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. 'What an interesting insight into our justice system!'\n    'Blatant corruption!' roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk. The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!'\n    Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,' said Dumbledore softly.\n    The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, 'was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age - '\n    'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose.\n    Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it.\n    'Oho!' said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. 'Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on - '\n    Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors?'\n    Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.\n    'Oh, very good, Minister, very good!'\n    Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too.\n    'Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - 'that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head.'\n    Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.\n    Umbridge recovered first.\n    That's all very fine, Headmaster,' she said, smiling sweetly, 'but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.'\n    'Well,' said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, 'they certainly would be, if they had continued after the Decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued?'\n    As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn, too, that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draught or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.\n    'Evidence?' repeated Umbridge, with that horrible wide toad-like smile. 'Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?'\n    'Oh, can she tell us about six months' worth of meetings?' said Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. 'I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.'\n    'Miss Edgecombe,' said Umbridge at once, 'tell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I'm sure that won't make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?'\n    Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside.\n    'Just nod or shake your head, dear,' Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, 'come on, now, that won't re-activate the jinx.'\n    Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta's face. Only her eyes were visible between the pulled-up robes and her curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank. And then - to Harry's utter amazement - 'Marietta shook her head.\n    Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge, then back at Marietta.\n    'I don't think you understood the question, did you, dear? I'm asking whether you've been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven't you?'\n    Again, Marietta shook her head.\n    'What do you mean by shaking your head, dear?' said Umbridge in a testy voice.\n    'I would have thought her meaning was quite clear,' said Professor McGonagall harshly, 'there have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?'\n    Marietta nodded.\n    'But there was a meeting tonight!' said Umbridge furiously. There was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organised it, Potter - why are you shaking your head, girl?'\n    'Well, usually when a person shakes their head,' said McGonagall coldly, 'they mean \"no\". So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign-language as yet unknown to humans - '\n    Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised; Kingsley started forwards and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.\n    'I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,' said Dumbledore and, for the first time, he looked angry.\n    'You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,' said Kingsley, in his deep, slow voice. 'You don't want to get yourself into trouble, now.'\n    'No,' said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. 'I mean, yes - you're right, Shacklebolt - I - I forgot myself.'\n    Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her. She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge's sudden attack, nor relieved by her release; she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her.\n    A sudden suspicion, connected to Kingsley's whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him, sprang into Harry's mind.\n    'Dolores,' said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, 'the meeting tonight - the one we know definitely happened - '\n    'Yes,' said Umbridge, pulling herself together, 'yes . . . well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor", "it?\" \n\"We couldn't... we couldn't just try a Summoning Charm?\" Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible. \n\"Certainly we could,\" said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \"Why don't you do it?\" \n\"Me? Oh . . . okay . . .\" Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, \"Accio Horcrux!\" \nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \n\"What was that?\" \n\"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\" \nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding. \n\"Did you think that would happen, sir?\" \n\"I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\" \n\"But we don't know what the thing was,\" said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water. \n\"What the things are, you mean,\" said Dumbledore. \"I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\" \n\"Professor?\" \n\"Yes, Harry?\" \n\"Do you think we're going to have to go into the lake?\" \n\"Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\" \n\"You don't think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\" \n\"Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\" And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake. \n\"So we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\" \n\"Yes, I think so.\" Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . . \n\"Aha,\" said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore's uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. \"So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\" \nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-thing invisible. \n\"Oho,\" said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumble-dore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore's buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point. \nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore's clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. \n\"How did you know that was there?\" Harry asked in astonish-ment. \n\"Magic always leaves traces,\" said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \"sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\" \n\"Is ... is this boat safe?\" \n\"Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\" \n\"So the things in the water won't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort's boat?\" \n\"I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\" \n\"But why have they let us?\" asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank. \n\"Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right.\" \nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. \"It doesn't look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\" \nDumbledore chuckled. \"Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\" \n\"But then \u2014 ?\" \n\"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and un-qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \"Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\" Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which be-gan to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rus-tle of the boat's prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves. \nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . . \nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. \"Professor!\" he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water. \n\"Harry?\" \n\"I think I saw a hand in the water \u2014 a human hand!\" \n\"Yes, I am sure you did,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat. \n\"So that thing that jumped out of the water \u2014 ?\" But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. \"There are bodies in here!\" said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own. \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore placidly, \"but we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\" \n\"At the moment?\" Harry repeated", "though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.\n    Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.\n    Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started.\n    'Just do it tomorrow!' said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. 'Come on, I'm starving.'\n    'I won't be long . . . look, you go ahead . . .\"\n    But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort's return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all . . .\n    Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it.\n    He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. 'Use it if you need me, all right?'\n    Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.\n    He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.\nThis is a two-way mirror, I've got the other one of the pair. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you'll appear in my mirror and I'll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.\nHarry's heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it - '\n    He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, 'Sirius.'\n    His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.\n    He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room:\n    'Sirius Black!'\n    Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own . . .\n    Sirius didn't have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry's head. That's why it's riot working . . .\n    Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again . . .\n    Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror - '\n    But then an idea struck him . . . a better idea than a mirror . . . a much bigger, more important idea . . . how had he never thought of it before - why had he never asked?\n    He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: The feast is about to start, you know, you're cutting it very fine!'\n    But Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .\n    How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn't need one, yet now . . .\n    He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast . . .\n    But just as he had given up hope, he saw it - a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor.\n    'Hey - hey, Nick! NICK!'\n    The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.\n    'Good evening,' he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. 'I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,' he sighed, 'in a rather different sense, of course . . .'\n    'Nick, can I ask you something?'\n    A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick's face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.\n    'Er - now, Harry?' said Nick, looking discomfited. 'Can't it wait until after the feast?'\n    'No - Nick - please,' said Harry, 'I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?'\n    Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.\n    'Oh, very well,' he said, looking resigned. 'I can't pretend I haven't been expecting it.'\n    Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead.\n    'Expecting what?' Harry asked, as he closed the door.\n    'You to come and find me,' said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. 'It happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.'\n    'Well,' said Harry, refusing to be deflected. 'You were right, I've - I've come to find you.'\n    Nick said nothing.\n    'It's - ' said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, 'it's just - you're dead. But you're still here, aren't you?'\n    Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.\n    That's right, isn't it?' Harry urged him. 'You died, but I'm talking to you . . . you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can't you?'\n    'Yes,' said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, 'I walk and talk, yes.'\n    'So, you came back, didn't you?' said Harry urgently. 'People can come back, right? As ghosts. They don't have to disappear completely. Well?' he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.\n    Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, 'Not everyone can come back as a ghost.'\n    'What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.\n    'Only . . . only wizards.'\n    'Oh,' said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. 'Well, that's OK then, the person I'm asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?'\n    Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.\n    'He won't come back.'\n    Who?'\n    'Sirius Black,' said Nick.\n    'But you did!' said Harry angrily. 'You", ". The people hurrying by didn't glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\n\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\nHarry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\" \"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.\"\n53\n\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter.\"\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle.\"\n\"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\n\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\n\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\nBut the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\nDoris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\n54\nwas tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\" \"Is he always that nervous?\"\n\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\nstudyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?\"\nVampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\nThe brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a\nsmall hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\nHe grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\nback into solid wall.\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring\n-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\"\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at\nonce: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad....\"\n55\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion\nbottles, globes of the moon.... \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -\n\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\nA treasure that was never yours,\nThief, you have been warned, beware\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n56\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing\ncoins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry", "ant trot due to the steep down-ward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final desti-nation and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. \nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up \nat the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. \nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. \nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. \nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \n\"You're not welcome.\" \nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke. \n\"Er \u2014 good morning. I'm from the Ministry of Magic \u2014\" \"You're not welcome.\" \n\"Er \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 I don't understand you,\" said Ogden nervously. \nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry's opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other. \n\"You understand him, I'm sure, Harry?\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Yes, of course,\" said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \"Why can't Ogden \u2014 ?\" \nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-denly understood. \n\"He's speaking Parseltongue?\" \n\"Very good,\" said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling. \nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other. \n\"Now, look \u2014\" Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers. \n\"Morfin!\" said a loud voice. \nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground. \n\"Ministry, is it?\" said the older man, looking down at Ogden. \"Correct!\" said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \"And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\" \n\"S'right,\" said Gaunt. \"Got you in the face, did he?\" \"Yes, he did!\" snapped Ogden. \n\"Should've made your presence known, shouldn't you?\" said Gaunt aggressively. \"This is private property. Can't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\" \n\"Defend himself against what, man?\" said Ogden, clambering back to his feet. \n\"Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\" Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. \"Get in the house. Don't argue.\" \nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again. \n\"It's your son I'm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\" said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \"That was Morfin, wasn't it?\" \n\"At, that was Morfin,\" said the old man indifferently. \"Are you pure-blood?\" he asked, suddenly aggressive. \n\"That's neither here nor there,\" said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. \nHe squinted into Ogdens lace and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \"Now I come to think about it, I've seen noses like yours down in the village.\" \n\"I don't doubt it, if your sons been let loose on them,\" said Og-den. \"Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\" \n\"Inside?\" \n\"Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I've already told you. I'm here about Morfin. We sent an owl \u2014\" \n\"I've no use for owls,\" said Gaunt. \"I don't open letters.\" \n\"Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of vis-itors,\" said Ogden tartly. \"I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning \u2014\" \n\"All right, all right, all right!\" bellowed Gaunt. \"Come in the bleeding house, then, and much good it'll do you!\" \nThe house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue: \nHissy, hissy, little snakey, \nSlither on the floor \nYou be good to Morfin \nOr he'll nail you to the door. \nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open win-dow, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone \nwall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother's, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person. \n\"M'daughter, Merope,\" said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked \ninquiringly toward her. ", "plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.\n\u3000\u3000\"May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\" said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. \"Professor Moody.\"\n\u3000\u3000It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students chapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody's bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody?\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"Mad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went to help this morning?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Must be,\" said Ron in a low, awed voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"What happened to him?\" Hermione whispered. \"What happened to his face?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno,\" Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.\n\u3000\u3000Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore cleared his throat.\n\u3000\u3000\"As I was saying,\" he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \"we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You're JOKING!\" said Fred Weasley loudly.\n\u3000\u3000The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\n\u3000\u3000\"I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\" he said, \"though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar.\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Er - but maybe this is not the time.. . no. . .\" said Dumbledore, \"where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament. . . well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.\n\u3000\u3000\"The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities -until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Death toll?\" Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.\n\u3000\u3000\"There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore continued, \"none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.\n\u3000\u3000\"The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm going for it!\" Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.\n\u3000\u3000\"Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,\" he said,\n\u3000\u3000\"the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age - that is to say, seventeen years or older - will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This\" -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious - \"is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hog-warts champion.\" His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred's and George's mutinous faces. \"I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.\n\u3000\u3000\"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.\n\u3000\u3000\"They can't do that!\" said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. \"We're seventeen in April, why can't we have a shot?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"They're not stopping me entering,\" said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table.\n\u3000\u3000\"The champions'll get to do all sorts of stuff you'd never be allowed to do normally.\n\u3000\u3000And a thousand Galleons prize money!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \"Yeah, a thousand Galleons. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on,\" said Hermione, \"we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.\n\u3000\u3000\"Who's this impartial judge who's going to decide who the champions are?\" said Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dunno,\" said Fred, \"but it's them we'll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George.. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore knows you're not of age, though,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, but he's not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?\" said Fred shrewdly. \"Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he'll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore's trying to stop us giving our names.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"People have died, though!\"", "i were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering. \n\"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. \"Impedimenta! Incarcerous!\" A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \"Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\" But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul... \nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around. \nDumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surround-ing Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . . \nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. \nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface. \n\"Sir,\" panted Harry, \"sir, I forgot \u2014 about fire \u2014 they were coming at me and I panicked \u2014\" \n\"Quite understandable,\" murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was. \nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall. \n\"I am weak...\" he said. \n\"Don't worry, sir,\" said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore's extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. \"Don't worry, I'll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .\" \nAnd pulling Dumbledore's uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight. \n\"The protection was . . . after all... well-designed,\" said Dum-bledore faintly. \"One alone could not have done it. ... You did well, very well, Harry. ...\" \n\"Don't talk now,\" said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore's voice had become, how much his feet dragged. \"Save your energy, sir. . . . We'll soon be out of here. . . .\" \n\"The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife ...\" ' \n\"There's no need, I got cut on the rock,\" said Harry firmly. \"Just tell me where. . . .\" \n\"Here . . .\" \nHarry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-ceived its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff. \n\"It's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \"We're nearly there. ... I can Apparate us both back . . . Don't worry. . . .\" \n\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\" \n\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n\n\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression. \nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that noth-ing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows. \n'We did it, Professor!' Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. 'We did it! We got the Horcrux!' \nDumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp. \n'Sir, are you all right?' \n'I've been better,' said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion ... was no health drink ...\" \nAnd to Harry's horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground. \n'Sir - it's OK, sir, you're going to be all right, don't worry -' \nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing. \n'We need to get you up to the school, sir ... Madam Pomfrey ...' \n'No,' said Dumbledore. 'It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ...' \n'Right - sir, listen - I'm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -' \n'Severus,' said Dumbledore clearly. 'I need Severus ...' \n'All right then, Snape - but I'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -' \nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard run- ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing-gown embroidered with", "She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.\n\u3000\u3000Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.\n\u3000\u3000\"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.\n\u3000\u3000\"Pain,\" said Moody softly. \"You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right. . . anyone know any others?\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked around. From the looks on everyone's faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes?\" said Moody, looking at her.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra,\" Hermione whispered.\n\u3000\u3000Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ah,\" said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \"Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra. .. the Killing Curse.\"\n\u3000\u3000He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.\n\u3000\u3000Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra!\" Moody roared.\n\u3000\u3000There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\n\u3000\u3000Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not nice,\" he said calmly. \"Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me.\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all....\n\u3000\u3000So that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?\n\u3000\u3000Harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry's father first.\n\u3000\u3000How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry.. . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son.. . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents' voices when he had fought the\n\u3000\u3000dementors last year - for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair.\n\u3000\u3000Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.\n\u3000\u3000\"Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, if there's no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you've got to know.\n\u3000\u3000You've got to appreciate what the worst is. You don't want to find yourself in a situation where you're facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\" he roared, and the whole class jumped again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . .\n\u3000\u3000.\"\n\u3000\u3000They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang - but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices - \"Did you see it twitch?\" \"- and when he killed it - just like that!\"\n\u3000\u3000They were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn't found it very entertaining - and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hurry up,\" she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Not the ruddy library again?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. \"Neville.\" Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville?\" Hermione said gently.\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked around.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh hello,\" he said, his voice much higher than usual. \"Interesting lesson, wasn't it?\n\u3000\u3000I wonder what's for dinner, I'm - I'm starving, aren't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville, are you all right?\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes, I'm fine,\" Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. \"Very interesting dinner - I mean lesson - what's for eating?\"\n\u3000\u3000Ron gave Harry a startled look.\n\u3000\u3000\"Neville, what - ?\"\n\u3000\u3000But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.\n\u3000\u3000\"It's all right, sonny,\" he said to Neville. \"Why don't you come up to my office? Come on. . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"You all right, are you, Potter?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, almost defiantly.\n\u3000\u3000Moody's blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he said, \"You've got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you've got to know. No point pretending. . . well.. . come on, Longbottom, I've got some books that might interest you.\"\n\u3000\u3000Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn't say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody's gnarled hands on his shoulder.\n\u3000\u3000\"What was that about?\" said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.\n\u3000\u3000\"", "please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\" \nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \n\"What happened when Katie touched the necklace?\" \n\"She rose up in the air,\" said Harry, before either Ron or Hermi-one could speak, \"and then began to scream, and collapsed. Profes-sor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\" \n\"The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. \n\"Away?\" Harry repeated angrily. \n\"Yes, Potter, away!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"But any-thing you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I'm sure!\" \nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at. \n\"I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\" ; \nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embar-rassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry. \n\"That is a very serious accusation, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \"Do you have any proof?\" \n\"No,\" said Harry, \"but.. .\" and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had over-heard between him and Mr. Borgin. \nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused. \n\"Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\" \n\"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But that's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace \u2014\" \n\"You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\" \n\"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him \u2014\" \n\"But Harry,\" Hermione interrupted, \"Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no \u2014\" \n\"Because he didn't want to touch it, obviously!\" said Harry angrily. \n\"What he actually said was, 'How would I look carrying that down the street?'\" said Hermione. \n\"Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,\" inter-jected Ron. \n\"Oh, Ron,\" said Hermione despairingly, \"it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn't have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street \u2014 and in any case,\" she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \"I asked Borgin about the necklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn't say it was already sold or anything \u2014\" \n\"Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn't going to tell you \u2014 anyway, Malfoy could've sent off for it since \u2014\" \n\"That's enough!\" said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. \"Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people \u2014\" \n\"\u2014 that's what I said \u2014\" muttered Ron. \n\"\u2014 and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have en-tered this school without our knowledge \u2014\" \n\"But \u2014\" \n\"\u2014 and what is more,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \"Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.\" \nHarry gaped at her, deflating. \n\"How do you know, Professor?\" \n\"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\" she said as she marched past them, \"but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\" \nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word. \nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; \nnevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started dis-cussing what had happened. \n\"So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room. \n\"Goodness only knows,\" said Hermione. \"But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.\" \n\"It could've been meant for loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore \u2014 the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn \u2014 Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can't be pleased that he's sided with Dumbledore. Or \u2014\" \n\"Or you,\" said Hermione, looking troubled. \n\"Couldn't have been,\" said Harry, \"or Katie would've just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn't she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?\" \n\"Harry, Malfoy wasn't in Hogsmeade!\" said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration. \n\"He must have used an accomplice, then,\" said Harry. \"Crabbe or Goyle \u2014 or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he'll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he's joined up \u2014\" \nRon and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There's no point arguing with him. \n\"Dilligrout,\" said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady. \nThe portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie's fate had not yet spread. \n\"It wasn't a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,\" said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. \"The curse didn't even make it into the castle. Not what you'd call foolproof.\" \n\"You're right,\" said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. \"It wasn't very well thought-out at all.\" \n\"But since when has Malfoy been one of the world's great thinkers?\" asked Harry. \nNeither Ron nor Hermione answered him. \n\nChapter 13: The secret riddle\n\n\nKatie was removed to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target. \n\"Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,\" said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory. \nHarry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night's lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore's office at eight o'clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There", "ah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\"\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\n\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?\"\nHarry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\n245\nstanding up to look at him.\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get\nthem nice and empty before next year starts....\n\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...\n\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\n\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\"\nAt last there was silence again.\n\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\n246\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted\nfrom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\n\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\nIt was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\n247\nnever, ever forget tonight.\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out\nof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I'll send you an owl.\"\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I'll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:\n\"Bye, Harry!\"\n\"See you, Potter!\"\n\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\n\"Not where I'm going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"\n248\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.\n\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\"\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\"Busy year?\" she said.\n\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\"\n\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \"Ready, are you?\"\nIt was Uncle", "and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage.\n\u3000\u3000\"The second step you must take - and at once,\" Dumbledore pressed on, \"is to send envoys to the giants.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Envoys to the giants?\" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. \"What madness is this?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,\" said Dumbledore, \"or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You - you cannot be serious!\" Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore. \"If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants -people hate them, Dumbledore - end of my career -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You are blinded,\" said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, \"by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius!\n\u3000\u3000You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any - and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now-take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act - and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Insane,\" whispered Fudge, still backing away. \"Mad . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry's bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.\n\u3000\u3000\"If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore, \"we have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I - I shall act as I see fit.\"\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore's voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.\n\u3000\u3000\"Now, see here, Dumbledore,\" he said, waving a threatening finger. \"I've given you free rein, always. I've had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet. There aren't many who'd have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you're going to work against me -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"The only one against whom I intend to work,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.\"\n\u3000\u3000It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, \"He can't be back, Dumbledore, he just can't be ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\n\u3000\u3000\"There,\" said Snape harshly. \"There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\"\n\u3000\u3000Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape's arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \"I don't know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.\"\n\u3000\u3000He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Your winnings,\" he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harrys bedside table. \"One thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances .. .\"\n\u3000\u3000He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry's bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"There is work to be done,\" he said. \"Molly... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course you can,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute. \"We know what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then I need to send a message to Arthur,\" said Dumbledore. \"All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact\n\u3000\u3000those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll go to Dad,\" said Bill, standing up. \"I'll go now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent,\" said Dumbledore. \"Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Leave it to me,\" said Bill.\n\u3000\u3000He clapped a hand on Harry's shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.\n\u3000\u3000\"Minerva,\" said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, \"I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also - if she will consent to come - Madame Maxime.\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\n\u3000\u3000\"Poppy,\" Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, \"would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moodys office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Very - very well,\" said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.\n\u3000\u3000Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey's footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"And now,\" he said, \"it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.\"\n\u3000\u3000The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sirius Black!\" she shrieked, pointing at him.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mum, shut up!\" Ron yelled. \"It's okay!\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face", "it is to clean all the time - we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to SPEW, it would raise awareness as well as funds.'\n    'I'll sponsor you to shut up about SPEW,' Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him.\n*\nHarry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.\n    The fact as that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he'd experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.\n    On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig's owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\n    'Booklists have arrived,' he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. 'About time, I thought they'd forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .'\n    Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron's head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.\n    'Only two new ones,' he said, reading the list, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.'\n    Crack.\n    Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn't even fall off his chair.\n    'We were just wondering who set the Slinkhard book,' said Fred conversationally\n    'Because it means Dumbledore's found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,' said George.\n    'And about time too,' said Fred.\n    'What d'you mean?' Harry asked, jumping down beside them.\n    Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,' Fred told Harry, 'and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.'\n    'Not surprising, is it, when you look at what's happened to the last four?' said George.\n    'One sacked, one dead, one's memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months,' said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. 'Yeah, I see what you mean.'\n    'What's up with you, Ron?' asked Fred.\n    Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\n    'What's the matter?' said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.\n    Fred's mouth fell open, too.\n    'Prefect?' he said, staring incredulously at the letter. 'Prefect?'\n    George leapt forwards, seized the envelope in Ron's other hand and turned it upside-down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George's palm.\n    'No way,' said George in a hushed voice.\n    'There's been a mistake,' said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron's grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark. 'No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect.'\n    The twins' heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.\n    'We thought you were a cert!' said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.\n    'We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!' said George indignantly.\n    'Winning the Triwizard and everything!' said Fred.\n    'I suppose all the mad stuff must've counted against him,' said George to Fred.\n    'Yeah,' said Fred slowly. 'Yeah, you've caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you's got their priorities right.'\n    He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look.\n    'Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the Prefect.'\n    'Ohh, Mum's going to be revolting,' groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.\n    Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large 'P' was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy's chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.\n    The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.\n    'Did you - did you get - ?'\n    She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek.\n    'I knew it!' she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. 'Me too, Harry, me too!'\n    'No,' said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand. 'It's Ron, not me.'\n    'It - what?'\n    'Ron's prefect, not me,' Harry said.\n    'Ron?' said Hermione, her jaw dropping. 'But . . . are you sure? I mean - '\n    She turned red as Ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace.\n    'It's my name on the letter,' he said.\n    'I . . .' said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. 'I . . . well . . . wow! Well done, Ron! That's really - '\n    'Unexpected,' said George, nodding.\n    'No,' said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, 'no it's not . . . Ron's done loads of . . . he's really . . .'\n    The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs Weasley bucked into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.\n    'Ginny said the booklists had come at last,' she said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles. 'If you give them to me I'll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you're packing. Ron, I'll have to get you more pyjamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can't believe how fast you're growing . . . what colour would you like?'\n    'Get him red and gold to match his badge,' said George, smirking.\n    'Match his what?' said Mrs Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on Ron's pile.\n    'His badge,' said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly. 'His lovely shiny new prefect's badge.'\n    Fred's words took a moment to penetrate Mrs Weasley's preoccupation with pyjamas.\n    'His . . . but . . . Ron, you're not . . .?'\n    Ron held up his badge.\n    Mrs Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione's.\n    'I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!'\n    'What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?' said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her", ".\n    'Potter and Chang!' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. 'Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste . . . at least Diggory was good-looking!'\n    The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n    'So . . . where d'you want to go?' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n    'Oh . . . I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 'Urn . . . shall we just have a look in the shops or something?'\n    They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, 'By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n    It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, 'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere . . .'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. 'Yeah, that is weird.\n    He wasn't sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. The) had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them . . . it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n    The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed. Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck.\n    'Um . . . d'you want to get a coffee?' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n    'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around. 'Where?'\n    'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's?' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbndge's office.\n    'Cute, isn't it?' said Cho happily.\n    'Er . . . yeah,' said Harry untruthfully.\n    'Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day!' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n    'Aaah . . .'\n    They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that t was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n    'What can I get you, m'dears?' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty.\n    Two coffees, please,' said Cho.\n    In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.\n    After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during DA meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.\n    'Er . . . listen, d'you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I'm meeting Hermione Granger there.'\n    Cho raised her eyebrows.\n    'You're meeting Hermione Granger? Today?'\n    'Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D'you want to come with me? She said it wouldn't matter if you did.'\n    'Oh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.'\n    But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all. On the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding.\n    A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Beside them,\n    Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips.\n    Cho's hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest, just reach out and grab it. Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . .\n    But just as he moved his hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.\n    'He asked me out, you know,' she said in a quiet voice. 'A couple: of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.'\n    Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come: out with him?\n    He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.\n    'I came in here with Cedric last year,' said Cho.\n    In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry's insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.\n    Cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again.\n    'I've been meaning to ask you for ages . . . did Cedric - did he - m - m - mention me at all before he died?'\n    This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.\n    'Well - no - ' he said quietly. There - there wasn't time for him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d'you . . . d'you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?'\n    His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last DA meeting before Christmas.\n    'Look,' he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, let's not talk about Cedric right now . . . let's talk about something else . . .'\n    But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.\n    'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'", "her eyes brimming with tears. \"M-m-master, p-p-please. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched.\n\u3000\u3000There was no pity in his gaze.\n\u3000\u3000\"Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,\" he said slowly. \"I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No!\" shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch's feet. \"No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch's feet.\n\u3000\u3000\"But she was frightened!\" Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. \"Your elf's scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can't blame her for wanting to get out of their way!\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.\n\u3000\u3000\"I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,\" he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. \"I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master's reputation.\"\n\u3000\u3000Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, \"Well, I think I'll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody's got any objections. Amos, that wand's told us all it can - if Harry could have it back, please -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come on, you three,\" Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn't seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. \"Hermione!\" Mr. Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going to happen to Winky?\" said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't know,\" said Mr. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"The way they were treating her!\" said Hermione furiously. \"Mr. Diggory, calling her 'elf' all the time. . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn't do it and he's still going to sack her! He didn't care how frightened she'd been, or how upset she was - it was like she wasn't even human!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, she's not,\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione rounded on him.\n\u3000\u3000\"That doesn't mean she hasn't got feelings, Ron. It's disgusting the way -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, I agree with you,\" said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, \"but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the others?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We lost them in the dark,\" said Ron. \"Dad, why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll explain everything back at the tent,\" said Mr. Weasley tensely.\n\u3000\u3000But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's going on in there?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who conjured it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur - it's not - Him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course it's not Him,\" said Mr. Weasley impatiently. \"We don't know who it was; it\n\u3000\u3000looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.\"\n\u3000\u3000He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.\n\u3000\u3000Charlie's head was poking out of the boys' tent.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dad, what's going on?\" he called through the dark. \"Fred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I've got them here,\" said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\n\u3000\u3000Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you get them, Dad?\" said Bill sharply. \"The person who conjured the Mark?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"We found Barry Crouch's elf holding Harry's wand, but we're none the wiser about who actually conured the Mark.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together. \"Harry's wand?\" said Fred.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mr. Crouch's elf\" said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\n\u3000\u3000With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\" he said. \"Running away when he'd expressly told her not to. . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry. . . how would that have looked, if she'd been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"She didn't do anything - she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!\" Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy - better, indeed, than any of the others.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch's position can't afford a house-elf who's going to run amok with a wand!\" said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"She didn't run amok!\" shouted Hermione. \"She just picked it up off the ground!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?\" said Ron impatiently. \"It wasn't hurting anyone. . . . Why's it such a big deal?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I don't get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean. . . it's still only a shape in the sky. .\n\u3000\u3000.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. . . .\" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone's worst fear. . . the very worst..\n\u3000\u3000There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Death Eaters?\" said Harry. \"", "they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.\n\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\"\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\"\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\n\"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming....\"\nRon couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.\n\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as\n210\nDumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\"\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\n\"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\n\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\n211\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\n\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\nhim... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...\"\n\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.\n\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off\nter sleep --\"\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?\"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\n\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\n212\ncloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\"\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\n\"We'll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\n\"What are you three doing inside?\"\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\nHarry swallowed -- now what?\n\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.\n\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\"\n\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\n\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --\n\"But this is important.\"\n\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.\n\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --\"\n213\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her", ", then resumed in a hoarse whisper, \". . . the board o' governors'll be talkin about shuttin' us up fer good.\"\n\"Surely not?\" said Hermione, looking worried.\n\"Gotta see it from their point o' view,\" said Hagrid heavily. \"I mean, it's always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn\u2019 it? Yer expect accidents, don' yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha's tliff'rent. 'S'no wonder Dumbledore's angry with Sn \u2014\"\nHagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.\n\"What?\" said Harry quickly. \"Dumbledore's angry with Snape?\"\n\"I never said tha\u2019,\" said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. \"Look at the time, it's gettin' on fer midnight, I need ter \u2014\"\n\"Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?\" Harry asked loudly.\n\"Shhhh!\" said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. \"Don\u2019 shout stuff like that, Harry, d'yeh wan\u2019 me ter lose me job? Mind, I don' suppose yeh'd care, would yeh, not now yeh've given up Care of Mag\u2014\"\n\"Don't try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!\" said Harry forcefully. \"What's Snape done?\"\n\"I dunno, Harry, I shouldn'ta heard it at all! I \u2014 well, I was comin\u2019 outta the forest the other evenin\u2019 an' I overheard 'em talking\u2014 well, arguin\u2019. Didn't like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen, but it was a \u2014 well, a heated discussion an' it wasn\u2019 easy ter block it out.\"\n\"Well?\" Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.\n\"Well \u2014 I jus' heard Snape sayin\u2019 Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he \u2014 Snape \u2014 didn\u2019 wan\u2019 ter do it any more \u2014\u201c\n\"Do what?\"\n\"I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin\u2019 a bit overworked, tha's all \u2014 anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he'd agreed ter do it an' that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An' then he said summat abou\u2019 Snape makin' investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there's nothin' strange abou' that!\" Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. \"All the Heads o' Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business \u2014\"\n\"Yeah, but Dumbledore's not having rows with the rest of them, is he?\" said Harry.\n\"Look,\" Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. \"I know what yeh're like abou' Snape, Harry, an' I don' want yeh ter go readin' more inter this than there is.\"\n\"Look out,\" said Hermione tersely.\nThey turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.\n\"Oho!\" he wheezed. \"Out of bed so late, this'll mean detention!\"\n\"No it won', Filch,\" said Hagrid shortly. \"They're with me, aren\u2019 they?\"\n\"And what difference does that make?\" asked Filch obnoxiously. \n\"I'm a ruddy teacher, aren' I, yeh sneakin' Squib!\" said Hagrid, firing up at once.\nThere was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch's skinny ankles.\n\"Get goin,\" said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.\nHarry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid's and Filch's raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\n  \nWhen there's strife and when there's trouble \nCall on Peevsie, he'll make double! \n  \nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls' dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry's suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. ...\n\"There you are, Potter!\"\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\n\"I've been waiting for you to come back,\" said McLaggen, disregarding Harry\u2019s drawn wand. \"Must\u2019ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn't look like he'll be fit for next week's match.\"\nIt took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.\n\"Oh . . . right. . . Quidditch,\" he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. \"Yeah ... he might not make it.\"\n\"Well, then, I'll be playing Keeper, won't I?\" said McLaggen.\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Yeah, I suppose so. ...\"\nHe could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.\n\"Excellent,\" said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. \"So when's practice?\"\n\"What? Oh . . . there's one tomorrow evening.\"\n\"Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I've got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.\"\n\"Right,\" said Harry unenthusiastically. \"Well, I'll hear them tomorrow, then. I'm pretty tired now ... see you . . .\"\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie's attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master's room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder's Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplic", "curled around his chest.\n\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp\n\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.\n\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\n\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly.\"\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...\n\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\n\"Do you think it's a ghost?\"\n223\n\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\"\n\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\n\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run.\"\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n\"Now what?\" said Ron.\n\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\n\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\"\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door.\n\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\n224\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\nhand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\nhis hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\n\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n225\n\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n\"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\"\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\"\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\"\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\"\n\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\"\n\"What about you?\"\n\"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes... look...\"\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n226\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.\n\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\n\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me think...\"\nThe white queen", "him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. Love,\nCharlie\nThey looked at one another.\n\"We've got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\"\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked\nas if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\n\"It's not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it's\nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a\ndog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.\"\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\n190\ninto a sweat.\n\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.\"\nHarry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\"It's too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.\"\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\n\"I won't let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle.\"\nWhen they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all.\"\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\n191\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\n\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\"\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\nshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"\n\"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!\"\n\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\" \"Don't,\" Harry advised her.\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out\n192\nof the darkness.\nCharlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\nAt last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST Things couldn't have been worse.\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\nHad Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\n193\n\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --\"\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\n\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower.", "first day back. ...\" \nShe caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them. \n\"So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,\" said Hermione, \"to be in the ladies' bathroom.\" \n\"Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,\" said Harry. \"Don't forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog-warts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .\" \nIn his mind's eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls. \n\"I think I'm going to take another swig of Felix,\" said Harry, \"and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.\" \n\"That would be a complete waste of potion,\" said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. \"Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn't enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don't go wasting the rest of that potion! You'll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ...\" She dropped her voice to a whisper. \n\"Couldn't we make some more?\" Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. \"It'd be great to have a stock of it. ... Have a look in the book... \" \nHarry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis. \n\"Blimey, its seriously complicated,\" he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. \"And it takes six months.,. You've got to let it stew. ...\" \n\"Typical,\" said Ron. \nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-sempra spell, captioned \"For Enemies,\" that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares. \nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. \nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. \nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch. \nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . . \nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around \u2014 but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. \nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \"tweaking the circumstances\"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else. \nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. \nThe run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis. \nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless. \nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle. \nHarry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open. \nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side", "looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. He turned on to his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore's job, and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption. Smiling to himself, Harry closed his eyes . . .\n    The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant . . . or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them . . .\n    He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries. He was speeding towards the plain black door . . . let it open . . . let it open . . .\n    It did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors . . . he crossed it, placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards . . .\n    Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate . . . he had to go on . . .\n    There was a door at the far end . . . it, too, opened at his touch . . .\n    And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres . . . now Harry's heart was beating fast with excitement . . . he knew where to go . . . he ran forwards, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room . . .\n    There was something in this room he wanted very, very much . . .\n    Something he wanted . . . or somebody else wanted . . .\n    His scar was hurting . . .\n    BANG!\n    Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter.\n    'Cool!' said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. 'I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it's like they mated, come and see!'\n    Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment . . . he had got so close that time.\n    Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening.\n*\nHarry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised Occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse.\n    He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class.\n    Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape's office after dinner. Halfway across the Entrance Hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.\n    'Over here,' said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape, and beckoning her across to the corner of the Entrance Hall where the giant hour-glasses stood. Gryffindor's was now almost empty. 'Are you OK? Umbridge hasn't been asking you about the DA, has she?'\n    'Oh, no,' said Cho hurriedly. 'No, it was only . . . well, I just wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell . .'\n    'Yeah, well,' said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully; it was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.\n    'She's a lovely person really,' said Cho. 'She just made a mistake -\n    Harry looked at her incredulously.\n    'A lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including you!'\n    'Well . . . we all got away, didn't we?' said Cho pleadingly. 'You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it's really difficult for her - '\n    'Ron's dad works for the Ministry too!' Harry said furiously. 'And in case you hadn't noticed, he hasn't got sneak written across his face - '\n    That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Cho fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list - '\n    'I think it was a brilliant idea,' said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.\n    'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea - '\n    'Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.\n    'I wasn't going to!' she shouted.\n    'Yeah . . . well . . . good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cope with at the moment.'\n    'Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off.\n    Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.\n    'You're late, Potter,' said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.\n    Snape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore's Pensieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry.\n    'So,' he said. 'Have you been practising?'\n    'Yes,' Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape's desk.\n    'Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?' said Snape smoothly. 'Wand out, Potter.'\n    Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them. His heart was pumping last with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.\n    'On the count of three then,' said Snape lazily. 'One - two - '\n    Snape's office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.\n    'Professor Snape, sir - oh - sorry - '\n    Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.\n    'It's all right, Draco,' said Snape, lowering his wand. 'Potter is here for a little remedial Potions.'\n    Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.\n    'I didn't know,' he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy - or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.\n    'Well, Draco, what is it?' asked Snape.\n    'It's Professor Umbridge, sir - she needs your help,' said Malfoy.\n    They've found Montague, sir, he's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.'\n    'How did he get in there?' demanded Snape.\n    'I don't know, sir, he's a bit confused.'\n    'Very well, very well. Potter,' said Snape, 'we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening.'\n    He turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed, 'Remedial Potions?' at Harry behind Snape's back before following him.\n    Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and", "Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\n\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\"\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son --\nhe'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\"\nHe didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.\nIt was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\nsomething.\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of\n-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\ninvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....\nHow very wrong he was.\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\nAlbus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down\n6\non the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\n\"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\n\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A\nfine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he\n7\nreally has gone, Dumbledore?\"\n\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n\"A what?\"\n\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\"\n\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\"\n\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\nby his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so\nconfusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\n\"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"\n\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\n\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's", ", 'haven't they gloated enough?'\n    A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.\n    'Oh, let's get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,' said Hermione.\n'Weasley can save anything,\nHe never leaves a single ring,\nThat's why Gryffindors all sing:\nWeasley is our King.'\n'Hermione . . .' said Harry slowly.\n    The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders.\n'Weasley is our King,\nWeasley is our King,\nHe didn't let the Quaffle in,\nWeasley is our King . . .'\n'No?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    'YES!' said Harry loudly.\n    'HARRY! HERMIONE!' yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. 'WE DID IT! WE WON!'\n    They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of 'Weasley is our King' died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.\n    'We'll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?' said Harry 'Yes, all right,' said Hermione wearily. 'I'm not in any hurry.' They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots.\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE -\nOWLs\nRon's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\n    They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\n    'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his right, I mean - and - well - you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest\n    to them - a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepulis - had heard him. 'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later - What?' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. 'Why are you grinning?'\n    'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 'I'm just glad we won, that's all.'\n    'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'\n    'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly.\n    'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though . . .' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?'\n    'Er - ' said Harry\n    'Well, actually . . . no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. 'As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal.'\n    Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 'You didn't watch?' he said faintly, looking from one to the other. 'You didn't see me make any of those saves?'\n    Well - no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him. 'But Ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to!'\n    'Yeah?' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 'How come?'\n    'It was Hagrid,' said Harry. 'He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. Anyway . . .\"\n    The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.\n    'He brought one back and hid it in the Forest?'\n    'Yep,' said Harry grimly.\n    'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 'No, he can't have.'\n    'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly. 'Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, 'as Hermy.'\n    Ron gave a nervous laugh.\n    'And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?'\n    Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry.\n    'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice.\n    'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. 'Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.'\n    'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly. 'I mean, come on . . . we've got exams and we're about that far - ' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching '- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates?'\n    'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice.\n    Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.\n    'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all.'\n*\nThe castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last.\n    Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OW", "telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'\n    'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you!'\n    By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\n    Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\n    He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\n    'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\n    Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\n    'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\n    Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\n    He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\n    'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\n    'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\n    Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\n    'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\n    Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\n    'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\n    'Er - ' said Harry.\n    He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\n    'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\n    'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\n    'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \"Exceeds Expectations\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.'\n    At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\n    'You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?' she went on, talking a little louder than before.\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?'\n    'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply. 'I would also advise -'\n    Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\n    'I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \"Exceeds Expectations\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging \"Acceptable\" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. 'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \"Outstanding\" in their OWLs, so - '\n    Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\n    'May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\n    'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. 'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?'\n    'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\n    'I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?' said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\n    'Were you?' said Professor McGonagall haughtily. 'Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \"Acceptable\" and \"Exceeds Expectations\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?'\n    'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. 'I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note.'\n    'What, this thing?' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\n    'Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror - '\n    'Did you not understand my note, Minerva?' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\n    'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.\n    'Well, then, I am confused . . . I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that - '\n    'False hope?' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. 'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '\n    'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '\n    'I should have made my", "ves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment: Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.\n    'And the best bit,' whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, 'is they can't contradict you, because they can't admit they've read the article!'\n    To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no issue of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster.\n    'Dad's reprinting!' she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. 'He can't believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!'\n    Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry's giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS' and 'EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE' in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like 'DUNG' and 'UMBRIDGE' at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were s t-ting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.\n    The dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick. He rolled over on to his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once . . .\n    He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair.\n    Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by t'le candles, knelt a man in black robes.\n    'I have been badly advised, it seems,' said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger.\n    'Master, I crave your pardon,' croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling.\n    'I do not blame you, Rookwood,' said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.\n    He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.\n    'You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?' asked Harry.\n    'Yes, My Lord, yes . . . I used to work in the Department aftet - 'after all . . .\"\n    'Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.'\n    'Bode could never have taken it, Master . . . Bode would have known he could not . . . undoubtedly, that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse . . .\"\n    'Stand up, Rookwood,' whispered Harry.\n    The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry's face.\n    'You have done well to tell me this,' said Harry. 'Very well . . . I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems . . . but no matter . . . we begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort's gratitude, Rookwood . . .'\n    'My Lord . . . yes, My Lord,' gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief.\n    'I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.'\n    'Of course, My Lord, of course . . . anything . . .'\n    'Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.'\n    Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door.\n    Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved towards it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness . . . a face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits ior pupils . . .\n    'NOOOOOOOOO!'\n    'What?' yelled a voice nearby.\n    Harry Hailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced he was about to see the white, skull-like lace looming at him out of the dark again, then very near to him Ron's voice spoke.\n    'Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here!'\n    Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. Ron\n    looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes.\n    'Has someone been attacked again?' asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet. 'Is it Dad? Is it that snake?'\n    'No - everyone's fine - ' gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire. 'Well . . . Avery isn't . . . he's in trouble . . . he gave him the wrong information . . . Voldemort's really angry . . .'\n    Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on to his bed, rubbing his scar.\n    'But Rookwood's going to help him now . . . he's on the right track again\n    'What are you talking about?' said Ron, sounding scared. 'D'you mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who?'\n    'I was You-Know-Who,' said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. 'He was with Rookwood, he's one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwood's just told him Bode couldn't have done it.'\n    'Done what?'\n    'Remove something . . . he said Bode would have known he couldn't have done it . . . Bode was under the Imperius Curse . . . I think he said Malfoy's dad put it on him.'\n    'Bode was bewitched to remove something?' Ron said. 'But - 'Harry, that's got to be - '\n    The weapon,' Harry finished the sentence for him. 'I know.'\n    The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter.\n    'Did you say,' murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry's on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, 'that you were You-Know-Who?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry quietly.\n    Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest.\n    'Harry,' he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, 'you've got to tell - '\n    'I haven't got to tell anyone,' said Harry shortly. 'I wouldn't have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I'm supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. That's what they want/\n    By 'they' he meant Dumbled", "ter . . . not even 'the Chosen One.'\" \n\"That was brilliant, Harry!\" chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.\n\"You really shouldn't have said it,\" said Hermione, frowning at Ron. \"What made you?\"\n\"He tried to jinx me, in case you didn't notice!\" fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn't he use another guinea pig for a change? What's Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, tndestructble stuff --\n\"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I thought he sounded a bit like you.\"\n\"Like me?\"\n\"Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\"\nHarry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.\n\"Harry! Hey, Harry!\"\nHarry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year's Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.\n\"For you,\" panted Sloper. \"Listen, 1 heard you're the new Captain. When're you holding trials?\"\n\"I'm not sure yet,\" said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \"I'll let you know.\" \n\"Oh, right. I was hoping it'd be this weekend -\"\n\"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.\nDear Harry,\nI would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.\nYours sincerely,\nAlbus Dumbledore\nP.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\n\"He enjoys Acid Pops?\" said Ron, who had read the message over Harry's shoulder and was looking perplexed.\n\"It's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\" said Harry in a low voice. \"Ha! Snape's not going to be pleased. . . . I won't be able to do his detention!\"\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon's double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape's.\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\n\"Harry,\" Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \"didn't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron -- Hermione?\" \nBefore they could say more than \"fine,\" the dungeon door opened and Slughorn's belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion's fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.\n\"Now then, now then, now then,\" said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \"Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don't forget your copies\nof Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\"\n\"Sir?\" said Harry, raising his hand.\n\"Harry, m'boy?\"\n\"I haven't got a book or scales or anything - nor's Ron - we didn't realize we'd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -\"\n\"Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\"\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.\n\"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" \nHe indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.\nHermione's well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else's; Slughorn pointed at her.\n\"It's Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the, drinker to tell the truth,\" said Hermione.\n\"Very good, very good!\" said Slughorn happily. \"Now,\" he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \"this one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can - ?\"\nHermione's hand was fastest once more.\n\"lt's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said.\nHarry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \n\"It's Amortentia!\"\n\"It is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,\" said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed,", "bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.\n    Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\n    'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.'\n    'What are you doing here?' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?'\n    'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas.' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.'\n    Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed.\n    'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . .'\n    She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\n    'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\n    'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\n    'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's.'\n    They do, do they?' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\n    'Well, you have!' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us!'\n    'It's you lot who won't look at me!' said Harry angrily.\n    'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\n    'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away.\n    'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\n    'Yeah?' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it.'\n    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\n    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\n    'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'\n    Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round.\n    'I forgot,' he said.\n    'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.\n    Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then?'\n    'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?'\n    Harry racked his brains.\n    'No,' he said.\n    Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.'\n    Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\n    'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\n    'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.'\n    This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ?'\n    'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.'\n    'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.'\n    Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth.\n    I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\n    Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice.\n*\nHow could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\n    Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\n    'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\n    Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay!'\n    Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt,", "\n\u3000\u3000Krum was looking surly again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Veil, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,\" he said, and he slouched off.\n\u3000\u3000\"Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous.\n\u3000\u3000\"Excellent! That's the whole point, you know - international magical cooperation!\"\n\u3000\u3000To Harry's displeasure, Percy now took Padma's vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall's hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"What do they think they're doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\" Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \"No respect...\"\n\u3000\u3000Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope my brothers weren't bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\" said Percy at once.\n\u3000\u3000\"What? Oh not at all, not at all!\" said Bagman. \"No, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko's Joke Shop. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Percy didn't look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George's plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.\n\u3000\u3000\"How do you feel the tournament's going, Mr. Bagman? Our department's quite satisfied -the hitch with the Goblet of Fire\" - he glanced at Harry - \"was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don't you think?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh yes,\" Bagman said cheerfully, \"it's all been enormous fun. How's old Barty doing?\n\u3000\u3000Shame he couldn't come.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh I'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,\" said Percy importantly, \"but in the meantime, I'm more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it's not all attending balls\" - he laughed airily - \"oh no, I've had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence - you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we've been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling. I've got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Let's go for a walk,\" Ron muttered to Harry, \"get away from Percy. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Pretending they wanted more drinks. Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\n\u3000\u3000\"... don't see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Severus, you cannot pretend this isn't happening!\" Karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. \"It's been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can't deny it _\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Then flee,\" said Snapes voice curtly. \"Flee - I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\"\n\u3000\u3000Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.\n\u3000\u3000\"Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!\" Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. \"And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!\" as a boy went rushing after her. \"And what are you two doing?\" he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.\n\u3000\u3000\"We re walking,\" Ron told Snape shortly. \"Not against the law, is it?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Keep walking, then!\" Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.\n\u3000\u3000\"What's got Karkaroff all worried?\" Ron muttered.\n\u3000\u3000\"And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?\"said Harry slowly.\n\u3000\u3000They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.\n\u3000\u3000\"Momen' I saw yeh, I knew,\" he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron froze. This didn't sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.\n\u3000\u3000\"What did you know, 'Agrid?\" said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.\n\u3000\u3000Harry definitely didn't want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) - if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn't really an option.\n\u3000\u3000Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer's back, but the beetle just wasn't interesting enough to block out Hagrid's next words.\n\u3000\u3000\"I jus' knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I - I don't know what you mean, 'Agrid. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It was my mother,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"She was one o' the las' ones in Britain.\n\u3000\u3000'Course, I can' remember her too well. . . she left, see. When I was abou' three. She wasn' really the maternal sort. Well. . . it's not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000Madame Maxime didn't say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the\n\u3000\u3000beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer's antlers, listening. ... He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen'. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an' put him on top o' the dresser if he annoyed me", "Dean to split up over it,\" said Harry, still trying to sound casual. \"Or are they still together?\" \n  \n\"Yes, they are \u2014 but why are you so interested?\" asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look. \n  \n\"I just don't want my Quidditch team messed up again!\" he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, \"Harry!\" giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. \"Oh, hi, Luna.\" \n  \n- \"I went to the hospital wing to find you,\" said Luna, rummaging in her bag. \"But they said you'd left...\" \nShe thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron's hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry. \n  \n\". . . I've been told to give you this.\" \n  \nIt was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore. \n  \n\"Tonight,\" he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it. \n  \n\"Nice commentary last match!\" said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely. \n  \n\"You're making fun of me, aren't you?\" she said. \"Everyone says I was dreadful.\" \n  \n\"No, I'm serious!\" said Ron earnestly. \"I can't remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?\" he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level. \n  \n\"Oh, it's a Gurdyroot,\" she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. \"You can keep it if you like, I've got a few of them. They're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.\" And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot. \n  \n\"You know, she's grown on me, Luna,\" he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. \"I know she's insane, but it's in a good \u2014\" He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. \"Hi,\" said Ron nervously. \n  \n\"C'mon,\" Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, \"Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\" \n  \nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry's Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work. \n  \n\"Thanks a lot, Hermione,\" said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o'clock. \"Listen, I\u2019ve got to hurry or I'll be late for Dumbledore. ...\" \n  \nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight. \n  \n\"Enter,\" called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney. \n  \n\"Aha!\" she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. \n  \n\"So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!\" \n  \n\"My dear Sybill,\" said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, \"there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don't think there is any more to be said \u2014\" \n  \n\"Very well,\" said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. \"If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. ... \n  \nPerhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. ...\" \n  \nShe pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls. \n  \n\"Please close the door and sit down, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired. \n  \nHarry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore's desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory. \n  \n\"Professor Trelawney still isn't happy Firenze is teaching, then?\" Harry asked. \n  \n\"No,\" said Dumbledore, \"Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \u2014 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \u2014 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\" \n  \nDumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, \"But never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly \u2014 have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?\" \n  \n\"Ah,\" said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. \"Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn't give it to me.\" There was a little silence. \n  \n\"I see,\" said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \"And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?\" \n  \n\"Well,\" Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. \"Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood \u2014\" \"And did that work?\" asked Dumbledore. \"Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned \u2014\" \"\u2014 which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.\" \n  \nA hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry\u2019s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. \n  \n\"Sir,\" he said, a little desperately, \"it isn't that I wasn't bothered or anything, I've just had other \u2014 other things . . .\" \n  \n", "open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.\n    'Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. 'I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now.'\n    The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\n    First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.\n    'A couple of people?' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people?'\n    'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?'\n    The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\n    'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have . . . twenty-five Butterbeers, please?'\n    The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\n    'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these . . .'\n    Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\n    'What have you been telling people?' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting?'\n    'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'\n    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\n    Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\n    In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\n    'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi.'\n    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\n    'Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'\n    She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, 'And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells - '\n    'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely.\n    'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once. 'But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because . . . because . . .' she took a great breath and finished, 'because Lord Voldemort is back.'\n    The reaction was immediate and predictable. Clio's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\n    Well . . . that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione. 'If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to -\n    'Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?' said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\n    'Well, Dumbledore believes it - ' Hermione began.\n    'You mean, Dumbledore believes him,' said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\n    'Who are you?' said Ron, rather rudely.\n    'Zacharias Smith,' said the boy, 'and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.'\n    'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '\n    'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry.\n    It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand.\n    'What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?' he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face. 'I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.'\n    The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.\n    Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know - '\n    'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho. 'I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.'\n    He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\n    'So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. 'So . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defence, then we need", "were two Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.\n    'Yes!' he whispered, moving towards them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?\n    'Is it those mad horse things?' said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. 'Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?'\n    'Yeah,' said Harry.\n    'How many?'\n    'Just two.'\n    'Well, we need three,' said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\n    'Four, Hermione,' said Ginny, scowling.\n    'I think there are six of us, actually,' said Luna calmly, counting.\n    'Don't be stupid, we can't all go!' said Harry angrily. 'Look, you three - ' he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, 'you're not involved in this, you're not - '\n    They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.\n    'OK, fine, it's your choice,' he said curtly, 'but unless we can find more Thestrals you're not going to be able - '\n    'Oh, more of them will come,' said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.\n    'What makes you think that?'\n    'Because, in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,' she said coolly, 'and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That's probably why these two turned up in the first place.'\n    Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood.\n    'OK, then,' he said, a bright idea occurring, 'Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she'll attract more Thestrals - '\n    'I'm not staying behind!' said Hermione furiously.\n    There's no need,' said Luna, smiling. 'Look, here come more now . . . you two must really smell . . .'\n    Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.\n    'All right,' he said angrily, 'pick one and get on, then.'\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR -\nThe Department\nOf Mysteries\nHarry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.\n    He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, open-mouthed and staring.\n    'What?' he said.\n    'How're we supposed to get on?' said Ron faintly. 'When we can't see the things?'\n    'Oh, it's easy,' said Luna, sliding obligingly from her Thestral and marching over to him, Hermione and Ginny. 'Come here . . .'\n    She pulled them over to the other Thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them on to the back of their mount. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into their horses mane and told them to grip tightly before she got back on to her own steed.\n    This is mad,' Ron murmured, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horses neck. 'Mad . . . if I could just see it - '\n    'You'd better hope it stays invisible,' said Harry darkly. 'We all ready, then?'\n    They all nodded and he saw live pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.\n    'OK . . .'\n    He looked down at the back of his Thestral's glossy black head and swallowed.\n    'Ministry of Magic, visitors' entrance, London, then,' he said uncertainly. 'Er . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .'\n    For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset.\n    Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream.\n    They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills . . .\n    This is bizarre!' Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support.\n    Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or how very fast they were travelling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sirius be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr Weasley was attacked.\n    On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry's face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the Thestral's sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip . . . he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards.\n    If they were too late . . .\n    He's still alive, he's still fighting, I can feel it . . .\n    If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . .\n    I'd know . . .\n    Harry's stomach gave a jolt; the Thestral's head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last . . . he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body . . . presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had.\n    And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale", ".\n\"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no\"\nHarry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\n\"Kill me then,\" panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \"Kill me like you killed him, you coward -\"\n\"DON'T -\" screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - \"CALL ME COWARD!\"\nAnd he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school's boundaries.\n\"Hagrid,\" muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \"HAGRID?\"\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\n\"Yeh all righ', Harry? Yeh all righ'? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..\"\nHagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang's reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\n\"I'm all right,\" panted Harry. \"Are you?\" \"'Course I am . . . take more'n that ter finish me.\"\nHagrid put his hands under Harry's arms and raised him up with such force that Harry's feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid's cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\n\"We should put out your house,\" said Harry, \"the charm's 'Aguamenti' ...\"\n\"Knew it was summat like that,\" mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \"Aguamenti!\"\nA jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \"Aguamenti\" too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\n\"S'not too bad,\" said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \"Nothin Dumbledore won' be able to put righ' . . .\"\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\n\"Hagrid ...\"\n\"I was bindin' up a couple o' bowtruckle legs when I heard 'em coming,\" said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \"They'll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\"\n\"Hagrid . . .\"\n\"But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters run-nin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em? Where's he gone - was he chasin' them?\"\n\"He . . .\" Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \"Hagrid, he killed . . .\"\n\"Killed?\" said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\"\n\"Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Snape killed .. . Dumbledore.\"\nHagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\n\"Dumbledore wha, Harry?\"\n\"He's dead. Snape killed him....\"\n\"Don' say that,\" said Hagrid roughly. \"Snape kill Dumbledore - don' be stupid, Harry. Wha's made yeh say tha'?\"\n\"I saw it happen.\" , ,..\n\"Yeh couldn' have.\"\n\"I saw it, Hagrid.\"\nHagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. ...\n\"What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\" Hagrid said confidently. \"I suppose he's gotta keep his cover. Look, let's get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. ...\"\nHarry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. ... As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .\nThe oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry's eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought\nDumbledore's body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\n\"What're they all lookin' at?\" said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \"Wha's that lyin' on the grass?\" Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \"See it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don' think someone got thrown - ?\"\nHagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .\nHe and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.\nHarry heard Hagrid's moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.\nDumbledore's eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleep", "ue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.\n\u3000\u3000There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.\n\u3000\u3000Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers.\n\u3000\u3000They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.\n\u3000\u3000\"What, you need three hours?\" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \"Who're you going with?\" he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.\n\u3000\u3000There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture.\n\u3000\u3000\"Lairy fights, that's the one!\" she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.\n\u3000\u3000Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was\n\u3000\u3000just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.\n\u3000\u3000\"I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\" muttered Dean.\n\u3000\u3000\"Animal magnetism,\" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.\n\u3000\u3000The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling.\n\u3000\u3000\"You - er - look nice,\" he said awkwardly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall,\" she added to Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron, looking around. \"Where's Hermione?\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati shrugged. \"Shall we go down then, Harry?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Okay,\" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.\n\u3000\u3000The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise.\n\u3000\u3000She didn't look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi,\" said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. \"Oh no ...\"\n\u3000\u3000He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Where is Hermione?\" he said again.\n\u3000\u3000A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.\n\u3000\u3000The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn't know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights - meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.\n\u3000\u3000Then Professor McGonagall's voice called, \"Champions over here, please!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, \"See you in a minute\" to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.\n\u3000\u3000It was Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow - or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty\n\u3000\u3000or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling - rather nervously, it was true - but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn't understand how he hadn't spotted it before.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hi, Harry!\" she said. \"Hi, Parvati!\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn't the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum's fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn't seem to be able to find an insult to throw at", "ck,\n    Ron's body turned into Bill's, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide open and empty. Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever.\n    'R - riddikulus!' she sobbed again.\n    Crack.\n    Mr Weasley's body replaced Bill's, his glasses askew, a trickle of blood running down his face.\n    'No!' Mrs Weasley moaned. 'No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus! RID-DIKULUS!'\n    Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .\n    'Mrs Weasley, just get out of here!' shouted Harry, staring down at his own dead body on the floor. 'Let someone else - '\n    'What's going on?'\n    Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling out his own wand, he said, very firmly and clearly:\n    'Riddikulus!'\n    Harry's body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.\n    'Oh - oh - oh!' gulped Mrs Weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands.\n    'Molly' said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her. 'Molly don't . . .'\n    Next second, she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin's shoulder.\n    'Molly it was just a Boggart,' he said soothingly, patting her on the head. 'Just a stupid Boggart . , .'\n    'I see them d - d - dead all the time!' Mrs Weasley moaned into his shoulder. 'All the t - t - time! I d - d - dream about it . . .'\n    Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the Boggart, pretending to be Harry's body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody's magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.\n    'D - d - don't tell Arthur,' Mrs Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. 'I d - d - don't want him to know . . . being silly . . .'\n    Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.\n    'Harry, I'm so sorry. What must you think of me?' she said shakily. 'Not even able to get rid of a Boggart . . .'\n    'Don't be stupid,' said Harry, trying to smile.\n    'I'm just s - s - so worried,' she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again. 'Half the f - f - family's in the Order, it'll b - b - be a miracle if we all come through this . . . and P - P - Percy's not talking to us . . . what if something d-d - dreadful happens and we've never m - m - made it up with him? And what's going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who's g - g - going to look after Ron and Ginny?'\n    'Molly, that's enough,' said Lupin firmly. This isn't like last time. The Order are better prepared, we've got a head start, we know what Voldemort's up to - '\n    Mrs Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.\n    'Oh, Molly, come on, it's about time you got used to hearing his name - look, I can't promise no one's going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we're much better off than we were last time. You weren't in the Order then, you don't understand. Last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one . . .'\n    Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents' beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.\n    'Don't worry about Percy,' said Sirius abruptly. 'He'll come round. It's only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry's going to be begging us to forgive them. And I'm not sure I'll be accepting their apology,' he added bitterly.\n    'And as for who's going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,' said Lupin, smiling slightly, 'what do you think we'd do, let them starve?'\n    Mrs Weasley smiled tremulously.\n    'Being silly,' she muttered again, mopping her eyes.\n    But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the Boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs Weasley's family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.\n    Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.\n    'Cut it out,' he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded.\n    'First sign of madness, talking to your own head,' said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall.\n    Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefects badge.\n- CHAPTER TEN -\nLuna Lovegood\nHarry had a troubled nights sleep. His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs Weasley sobbed over Kreacher's dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking clown a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.\n    '. . . better hurry up, Mums going ballistic, she says we're going to miss the train . . .' \n    There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs Black and Mrs Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.\n    ' - COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS - '\n    ' - FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS - '\n    Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered, just as Harry was putting on his trainers. Hedwig was swaying or her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.\n    'Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back.' The owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage. Are you ready yet?'\n    'Nearly. Is Ginny all right?' Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.\n    'Mrs Weasley's patched her up,' said Hermione. 'But now Mad-Eye's complaining that we can't leave unless Sturgis Podmore's here, otherwise the guard will be one short.'\n    'Guard?' said Harry. 'We have to go to King's Cross with a guard?'\n    'You have to go to King's Cross with a guard,' Hermione corrected him.\n    'Why?' said Harry irritably. 'I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he's going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in.'\n    'I don't know, it's just what Mad-Eye says,' said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, 'but if we don't leave soon we're definitely going to miss the train . . .'\n    'WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!'", "year, he hired Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody's well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\n\u3000\u3000Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore.\n\u3000\u3000Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.\n\u3000\u3000An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures.\n\u3000\u3000While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \"very frightening.\"\n\u3000\u3000'I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\" says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. \"We all hate Hagrid, but we're just too scared to say anything.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" highly dangerous crosses between manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\n\u3000\u3000\"I was just having some fun,\" he says, before hastily changing the subject.\n\u3000\u3000As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\u3000\u3000Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\n\u3000\u3000While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors\n\u3000\u3000working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Frid-wulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\n\u3000\u3000In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\n\u3000\u3000Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did she find out?\" he whispered.\n\u3000\u3000But that wasn't what was bothering Harry.\n\u3000\u3000\"What d'you mean, 'we all hate Hagrid'?\" Harry spat at Malfoy. \"What's this rubbish about him\" - he pointed at Crabbe - \"getting a bad bite off a flobberworm? They haven't even got teeth!\"\n\u3000\u3000Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf's teaching career,\" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. \"Half-giant. . . and there was me thinking he'd just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. ... They'll be worried he'll eat their kids, ha, ha. ...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"You-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you paying attention over there?\"\n\u3000\u3000Professor Grubbly-Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\n\u3000\u3000\"I hope she stays, that woman!\" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. \"That's more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . .\n\u3000\u3000.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What about Hagrid?\" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\n\u3000\u3000\"What about him?\" said Parvati in a hard voice. \"He can still be gamekeeper, can't he?\"\n\u3000\u3000Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same.\n\u3000\u3000She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\n\u3000\u3000\"That was a really good lesson,\" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \"I didn't know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Look at this!\" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione's nose.\n\u3000\u3000Hermione's mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron's.\n\u3000\u3000\"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don't think Hagrid told her?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \"He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\" said Hermione quietly.\n\u3000\u3000\"We'd have seen her in the garden!\" said Ron. \"Anyway, she's not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Maybe she's got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \"Sort of thing she'd do, isn't it, hide in bushes listening to people.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Like you and Ron did, you mean,\" said Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't trying to hear him!\" said Ron indignantly. \"We didn't have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We've got to go and see him,\" said Harry. \"This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?\" he shot at Hermione.\n\u3000\u3000\"I - well, I'm not going to pretend it didn't make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\" Hermione\n\u3000\u3000added hastily, quailing under Harry's furious stare.\n\u3000\u3000So that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid's cabin. They knocked, and Fang's booming barks answered.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hagrid, it's us!\" Harry shouted, pounding on the door", "voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n12\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\n13\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\n\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\n\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\"\nHarry groaned.\n\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing...\"\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes\nof Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He\nwore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\n14\nPetunia was how he had gotten it.\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\"\nDon't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig.\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult\nas there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\"\n\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"\n\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''\n15\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty ... thirty...\"\n\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\"\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair.\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\"Bad news", ",' said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, 'How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?'\n    'He feels angry, of course,' said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. 'Because he's told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister's too much of an idiot to believe him.'\n    'So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back?' said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. 'You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore'5 been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?'\n    'I wasn't the sole witness,' snarled Harry. There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?'\n    'I'd love them,' breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. 'A great bold headline: \"Potter Accuses . . .\" A sub-heading, \"Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us\". And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you, \"Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who's attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters . . .\" '\n    The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died.\n    'But of course,' she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, 'Little Miss Perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she?'\n    'As a matter of fact,' said Hermione sweetly, 'that's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.'\n    Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang 'Weasley is our King' dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.\n    'You want me to report what he says about He Who Must Not Be Named?' Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.\n    'Yes, I do,' said Hermione. 'The true story. All the facts. Exactly a; Harry reports them. He'll give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now - oh, get a grip on yourself,' she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemort's name, Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself.\n    Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, The Prophet wouldn't print it. In case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he's delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle - '\n    'We don't need another story about how Harry's lost his marbles!' said Hermione angrily. 'We've had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!'\n    There's no market for a story like that,' said Rita coldly.\n    'You mean the Prophet won't print it because Fudge won't let them,' said Hermione irritably.\n    Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, 'All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won't print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It's against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don't want to believe You-Know-Who's back.'\n    'So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?' said Hermione scathingly.\n    Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,\n    The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,' she said coldly\n    'My dad thinks it's an awful paper,' said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eye;. 'He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn't care about making money.'\n    Rita looked disparagingly at Luna.\n    'I'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?' she said. 'Probably, Twenty-five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale?'\n    'No,' said Luna, dipping her onion back into her Gillywater, 'he's the editor of The Quibbler.'\n    Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm.\n    ' \"Important stories he thinks the public needs to know\", eh?' she said witheringly. 'I could manure my garden with the contends of that rag.'\n    'Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn't it?' said Hermione pleasantly. 'Luna says her father's quite happy to take Harry's interview. That's who'll be publishing it.'\n    Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter.\n    'The Quibbler!' she said, cackling. 'You think people will take him seriously if he's published in The Quibbler!'\n    'Some people won't,' said Hermione in a level voice. 'But the Daily Prophet's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn't a better explanation of what happened, and if there's an alternative story available, even if it is published in a - ' she glanced sideways at Luna, 'in a - well, an unusual magazine - I think they might be rather keen to read it.'\n    Rita didn't say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.\n    'All right, let's say for a moment I'll do it,' she said abruptly. 'What kind of fee am I going to get?'\n    'I don't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,' said Luna dreamily. They do it because it's an honour and, of course, to see their names in print.'\n    Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione.\n    'I'm supposed to do this for free?'\n    'Well, yes,' said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. 'Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in Azkaban.'\n    Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione's drink and thrust it up her nose.\n    'I don't suppose I've got any choice, have I?' said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.\n    'Daddy will be pleased,' said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Rita's jaw.\n    'OK, Harry?' said Hermione, turning to him. 'Ready to tell the public the truth?'\n    'I suppose,' said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.\n    'Fire away, then, Rita,' said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass.\n- CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX -\nSeen and Unforseen\nLuna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita's interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, ' - and of course, that", "- when - you know -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We weren't talking.\" Harry finished the sentence for him. \"Yeah, but blackmail...\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's this joke shop idea they've got,\" said Ron. \"I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They've only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think about their future, and Dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but. . . they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Wouldn't they?\" said Ron, looking skeptical. \"I dunno . . . they don't exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes, but this is the law\" said Hermione, looking scared. \"This isn't some silly school rule. . . . They'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . . maybe you'd\n\u3000\u3000better tell Percy. . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Are you mad?\" said Ron. \"Tell Percy? He'd probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\" He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had departed, then said, \"Come on, let's get some breakfast.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"D'you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody?\" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep. Let's give it till break.\"\n\u3000\u3000History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\n\u3000\u3000When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.\n\u3000\u3000\"Professor Moody?\" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.\n\u3000\u3000\"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\n\u3000\u3000\"Come in here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you find him?\" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did you use the map?\" Harry said.\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere on there.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"So he did Disapparate?\" said Ron.\n\u3000\u3000\"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor?\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You're another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way. Granger.\"\n\u3000\u3000Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, he wasn't invisible,\" said Harry. \"The map shows invisible people. He must've left the grounds, then.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"But under his own steam?\" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, someone could've - could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn't they?\" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\n\u3000\u3000\"We can't rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody.\n\u3000\u3000\"So,\" said Ron, \"d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he's not here.\"\n\u3000\u3000He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \"Now, Dumbledore's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" said Harry. \"Oh yeah . . .\"\n\u3000\u3000He hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night.\n\u3000\u3000\"Should be right up your street, this one,\" said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \"From what Dumbledore's said, you've managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn't you?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"We helped,\" Ron said quickly. \"Me and Hermione helped.\"\n\u3000\u3000Moody grinned.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, help him practice for this one, and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't win,\"\n\u3000\u3000said Moody. \"In the meantime .. . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\" He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window.\n\u3000\u3000The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.\n\u3000\u3000\"You two,\" counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \"you stick close to Potter, all right? I'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.\"\n\u3000\u3000Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, \"Ha!\n\u3000\u3000She hasn't got wind of Crouch!\" then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.\n\u3000\u3000Harry - what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could have been killed.\n\u3000\u3000Your name didn't get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone's trying to attack you, they're on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn't go amiss either. There's nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I'm waiting for your letter giving me your word you won't stray out-of-bounds again.\n\u3000\u3000Sirius \"Who's he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?\" said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius's letter and put it inside his robes. \"After all the stuff he did at school!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He's worried about you!\" said Hermione sharply. \"Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"No one's tried to attack me all year,\" said Harry. \"No one's done anything to me at all-\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\" said Hermione. \"And they must've done that for a reason.", "Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody's office.\n    These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.\n    'And just look at these books!' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. 'A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .' She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. 'Harry, this is wonderful, there's everything we need here!'\n    And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read.\n    There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived.\n    'Whoa,' said Dean, staring around, impressed. 'What is this place?'\n    Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.\n    'Well,' said Harry, slightly nervously. This is the place we've found for practice sessions, and you've - er - obviously found it OK.'\n    'It's fantastic!' said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement.\n    'It's bizarre,' said Fred, frowning around at it. 'We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then.'\n    'Hey, Harry, what's this stuff?' asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.\n    'Dark detectors,' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. 'Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don't want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled\n    He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognisable. He turned his back on it.\n    'Well, I've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er - ' He noticed a raised hand. 'What, Hermione?'\n    'I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione.\n    'Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad.\n    Harry's stomach did yet another back-flip.\n    'Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed. 'It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So - 'everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?'\n    Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly.\n    'Er - right, thanks,' said Harry, who could feel his face burning. 'And - what, Hermione?'\n    'I also think we ought to have a name,' she said brightly, her hand still in the air. 'It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?'\n    'Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?' said Angelina hopefully.\n    'Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group?' suggested Fred.\n    'I was thinking,' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, 'more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.'\n    The Defence Association?' said Cho. 'The DA for short, so nobody knows what we're talking about?'\n    'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny. 'Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army, because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it?'\n    There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this.\n    'All in favour of the DA?' said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. That's a majority - motion passed!'\n    She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters:\nDUMBLEDORE'S ARMY\n'Right,' said Harry, when she had sat down again, 'shall we get practising then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it's pretty basic but I've found it really useful - '\n    'Oh, please,' said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. 'I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?'\n    'I've used it against him,' said Harry quietly. 'It saved my life in June.'\n    Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.\n    'But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,' Harry said.\n    Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.\n    'OK,' said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, 'I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise.'\n    It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.\n    You can practise with me,' Harry told him. 'Right - on the count of three, then - one, two, three - '\n    The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus. Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them.\n    'Expelliarmus! said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, tell his wand fly out of his hand.\n    'I DID IT!' said Neville gleefully. 'I've never done it before - I DID IT!'\n    'Good one!' said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. 'Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?'\n    Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.\n    'Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. 'Couldn't resist.'\n    Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.\n    'OK, stop!' Harry shouted. 'Stop.' STOP!'\n    I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands.\n    That wasn't bad,' said Harry,", "sounded as though you were hurt...' \n'I - well,' said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. 'I wished to - ah - deposit certain \u2013 um - personal items in the Room ...' And she muttered something about 'nasty accusations'. \n'Right,' said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. 'But you couldn't get in and hide them?' \nHe found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. \n'Oh, I got in all right,' said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. 'But there was somebody already in there.' \n'Somebody in -? Who?' demanded Harry. 'Who was in there?' \n' ? have no idea,' said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry's voice. 'I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.' \n'A voice? Saying what?' \n'I don't know that it was saying anything,' said Professor Trelawney. 'It was ... whooping.' \n'Whooping?' \n'Gleefully,' she said, nodding. \nHarry stared at her. \n'Was it male or female?' \n' ? would hazard a guess at male,' said Professor Trelawney. \n'And it sounded happy?' \n'Very happy,' said Professor Trelawney sniffily. \n'As though it was celebrating?' \n'Most definitely.' \n'And then -?' \n'And then I called out, \"Who's there?\"' \n'You couldn't have found out who it was without asking?' Harry asked her, slightly frustrated. \n\u2018The Inner Eye,' said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, 'was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.' \n'Right,' said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney's Inner Eye all too often before. 'And did the voice say who was there?' \n'No, it did not,' she said. 'Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!' \n'And you didn't see that coming?' said Harry, unable to help himself. \n'No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -' She stopped and glared at him suspiciously. \n'I think you'd better tell Professor Dumbledore,' said Harry. 'He ought to know Malfoy's celebrating - I mean, that some-one threw you out of the Room.' \nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty. \nThe Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,' she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -' \nHer bony hand closed suddenly around Harry's wrist. \n'Again and again, no matter how I lay them out -' \nAnd she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. \n'- the lightning-struck tower,' she whispered. 'Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time ...' \n'Right,' said Harry again. 'Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room ...' \n'You think so?' Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure. \n'I'm going to see him right now,' said Harry. 'I've got a meeting with him. We could go together.' \n'Oh, well, in that case,' said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche. \n'I miss having you in my classes, Harry,' she said soulfully, as they set off together. 'You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object...' \nHarry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney's continual predictions of doom. \n'I am afraid,' she went on, 'that the nag - I'm sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibra-tions of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!' \nHer voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind. \n'Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother's gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?' \nHarry mumbled something indistinct. \n'I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,' went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. 'He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog's Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me ... I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed towards Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...' \nAnd now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort. \n'... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!' \n'What?' \n'Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I'm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more dis-posed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?' \nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just real-ised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other. \n'Harry?' she repeated uncertainly. \nPerhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating every-thing except the information that had been kept from him for so long ... \nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunt-ing after Lily and James and their son ... \nNothing else mattered to Harry just now. \n'Harry?' said Professor Trelawney again. 'Harry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?' \n'You stay here,' said Harry through numb lips. \n'But, dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-' \n'You stay here!' Harry repeated angrily. \nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledore's corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore's door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered 'Enter' after Harry had already flung himself into the room. \nFawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold", "meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. 'He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.'\n    Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\n    'Any questions, Potter?'\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\n    'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '\n    'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.'\n    '- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another - '\n    'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.'\n    'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.\n    'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.\n    'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.\n    Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\n    'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\n    Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\n    'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\n    The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\n    There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\n    'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\n    'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\n    Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\n    Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\n    'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already . . .'\n    Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking . . .\n    He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him . . . there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve . . . nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach . . . and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\n    But the fact remained that if he was caught . . .\n    'Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from\n    Umbridge. 'And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!'\n    He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago . . .\n    And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room . . .\n    You're less like your father than I thought . . . the risk would've been what made it fun for James . . .\n    But did he want to be like his father any more?\n    'Harry, don't do it, please don't do it!' Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\n    He did not answer; he did not know what to do.\n    Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, 'Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.'\n    Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - '\n    Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.\n    'Harry - please!' Hermione pleaded weakly.\n    But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.\n    Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door.\n    He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.\n    Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.\n    Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\n    He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames.\n    'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!' Harry said loudly and clearly\n    It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around ir. the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretchec over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cole floor of Umbridge's office, and only his head hurtled through the emer", "moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.\n\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!\"\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut\n127\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\n\"Say 'please.\"'\n\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\n\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\"All right -please.\"\n\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\nHarry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\nThey weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\nand quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\nknew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\nHarry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.\n128\nThey fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\n\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it was standing on.\n\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\n\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.\"\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\nI hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\"No, we don't mind,\" he said. \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\n129\nback into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\nCHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\nIndeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\n\"Or both,\" said Harry.\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\nwas about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had\nhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n130\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.\nProfessor McGonagall\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\"\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they\nfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\n\"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You'll be in for it this time,\nPotter, first years aren't allowed them.\"\nRon couldn't resist it.\n\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus.\"\n\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow. \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\n131\n\"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\n\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\"\n\"A Nimbus Two Th", ".\n\u3000\u3000\"Don't be so silly,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"You've got to have dress robes, they're on your list! I got some for Harry too. . . show him, Harry... .\"\n\u3000\u3000In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn't as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn't have any lace on them at all - in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.\n\u3000\u3000\"I thought they'd bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Well, they're okay!\" said Ron angrily, looking at Harry's robes. \"Why couldn't I have some like that?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Because. . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn't a lot of choice!\"\n\u3000\u3000said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\n\u3000\u3000Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'm never wearing them,\" Ron was saying stubbornly. \"Never.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Fine,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"Go naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him.\n\u3000\u3000Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\"\n\u3000\u3000She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.\n\u3000\u3000\"Why is everything I own rubbish?\" said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon's beak.\n\u3000\u3000CHAPTER ELEVEN - ABOARD THE HOGWART EXPRESS\n\u3000\u3000There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\n\u3000\u3000He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur!\" she called up the staircase. \"Arthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers - \"I've got a quill here somewhere!\" - and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to -Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\n\u3000\u3000Amos Diggory's head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n\u3000\u3000\". . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d'you-call-'ems - please-men. Arthur, you've got to get over there --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Here!\" said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley's hands.\n\u3000\u3000\"- it's a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\" said Mr. Diggory's head. \"I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off -- if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur --\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What does Mad-Eye say happened?\" asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head rolled its eyes. \"Says he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What did the dustbins do?\" asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.\n\u3000\u3000\"Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,\" said Mr.\n\u3000\u3000Diggory. \"Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up -\"\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Weasley groaned.\n\u3000\u3000\"And what about the intruder?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,\" said Mr. Diggory's head, rolling its eyes again. \"Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there's a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye, he's had it -- think of his record -- we've got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department -- what are exploding dustbins worth?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Might be a caution,\" said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad-Eye didn't use his wand? He didn't actually attack anyone?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"I'll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"but they'll have a job proving it, there aren't any casualties.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"All right, I'm off,\" Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.\n\u3000\u3000Mr. Diggory's head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Sorry about this, Molly,\" it said, more calmly, \"bothering you so early and everything...but Arthur's the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye's supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last night. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Never mind, Amos,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Sure you won't have a bit of toast or anything before you go?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh go on, then,\" said Mr. Diggory.\n\u3000\u3000Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory's mouth.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fanks,\" he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.\n\u3000\u3000Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\n\u3000\u3000\"I'd better hurry - you have a good term, boys, said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate. \"Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King's Cross?\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Of course I will,\" she said. \"You just look after Mad-Eye, we'll be fine.\"\n\u3000\u3000As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.\n\u3000\u3000\"Did someone say Mad-Eye?\" Bill asked. \"What's he been up to now.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He says someone tried to break into his house last night,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n\u3000\u3000\"Mad-Eye Moody?\" said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast. \"Isn't he that nutter -\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,\" said Mrs. Weasley sternly.\n\u3000\u3000\"Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn't he?\" said Fred quietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. \"Birds of a feather. . .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Moody was a great wizard in his time,\" said Bill.\n\u3000\u3000\"He's an old friend of Dumbledore's, isn't he?\" said Charlie.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dumbledore's not what you'd call normal, though, is he?\" said Fred. \"I mean, I know he's a genius and everything.. .\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Who", "sent me all these, you know,' he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. 'Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?'\n    Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, 'So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore's back?'\n    'Yes,' said Neville, 'everything's settled right back to normal.'\n    'I s'pose Filch is happy, is he?' asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.\n    'Not at all,' said Ginny. 'He's really, really miserable, actually . . .' She lowered her voice to a whisper. 'He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts . . .'\n    All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it - how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him - nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n    'Madam Pomfrey says she's just in shock,' whispered Hermione.\n    'Sulking, more like,' said Ginny.\n    'Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,' said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly.\n    'Anything wrong, Professor?' called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.\n    'No . . . no . . .' said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. 'No, I must have been dreaming . . .'\n    Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n    'Speaking of centaurs,' said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, 'who's Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?'\n    'He's got to,' said Harry, 'the other centaurs won't take him back, will they?'\n    'It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,' said Ginny.\n    'Bet Dumbledore wishes he could've got rid of Trelawney for good,' said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. 'Mind you, the whole subject's useless if you ask me, Firenze isn't a lot better . . .'\n    'How can you say that?' Hermione demanded. 'After we've just found out that there are real prophecies?'\n    Harry's heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way . . .\n    'It is a pity it broke,' said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.\n    'Yeah, it is,' said Ron. 'Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either - where are you going?' he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.\n    'Er - Hagrid's,' said Harry. 'You know, he just got back and I promised I'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are.'\n    'Oh, all right then,' said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. 'Wish we could come.'\n    'Say hello to him for us!' called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. 'And ask him what's happening about . . . about his little friend!'\n    Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.\n    The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.\n    He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had not talked to him properly since he'd returned . . .\n    Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors.\n    Malfoy glanced around - Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers - then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, 'You're dead, Potter.'\n    Harry raised his eyebrows.\n    'Funny' he said, 'you'd think I'd have stopped walking around\n    Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.\n    'You're going to pay,' said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. 'I'm going to make you pay for what you've done to my father . . .'\n    'Well, I'm terrified now,' said Harry sarcastically. 'I s'pose Lord Voldemort's just a warm-up act compared to you three - what's the matter?' he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. 'He's a mate of your dad, isn't he? Not scared of him, are you?'\n    'You think you're such a big man, Potter,' said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. 'You wait. I'll have you. You can't land my father in prison - '\n    'I thought I just had,' said Harry.\n    The Dementors have left Azkaban,' said Malfoy quietly. 'Dad and the others'll be out in no time . . .'\n    'Yeah, I expect they will,' said Harry. 'Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now - '\n    Malfoy's hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy's fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.\n    'Potter!'\n    The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy . . . whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . .  . never . . .\n    'What are you doing, Potter?' said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.\n    'I'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,' said Harry fiercely.\n    Snape stared at him.\n    'Put that wand away at once,' he said curtly. Ten points from Gryff - '\n    Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.\n    'Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to - '\n    'Add some more?'\n    Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone, steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.\n    'Professor McGonagall!' said Snape, striding forwards. 'Out of St Mungo's, I see!'\n    'Yes, Professor Snape,' said Professor McGonagall. shru", "ing that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning . . .\n    'It hasn't really started yet,' sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. 'But it won't be long now\n    'Hey, Harry,' said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor.\n    Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight.\n    'What's - er - going on with you and her, anyway?' Ron asked quietly.\n    'Nothing,' said Harry truthfully.\n    'I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,' said Hermione tentatively.\n    Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius's death felt that way these days . . . the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.\n    'You're well out of it, mate,' said Ron forcefully. 'I mean, she's quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.'\n    'She's probably cheerful enough with someone else,' said Harry, shrugging.\n    'Who's she with now, anyway?' Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.\n    'Michael Corner,' she said.\n    'Michael - but - ' said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. 'But you were going out with him!'\n    'Not any more,' said Ginny resolutely. 'He didn't like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.' She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.\n    'Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,' he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry's quivering castle. 'Good for you. Just choose someone - better - next time.\n    He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.\n    'Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?' asked Ginny vaguely.\n    'WHAT?' shouted Ron, upending the chessboard: Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.\n    As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.\n    When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all.\n    There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.\n    'Ron, Ginny!' called Mrs Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly. 'Oh, and Harry dear - how are you?'\n    'Fine,' lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins' new clothes.\n    'What are they supposed to be?' he asked, pointing at the jackets.\n    'Finest dragonskin, little bro',' said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. 'Business is booming and we thought we'd treat ourselves.'\n    'Hello, Harry,' said Lupin, as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.\n    'Hi,' said Harry. 'I didn't expect . . . what are you all doing here?'\n    'Well,' said Lupin with a slight smile, 'we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.'\n    'I dunno if that's a good idea,' said Harry at once.\n    'Oh, I think it is,' growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. That'll be them, will it, Potter?'\n    He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry's reception committee.\n    'Ah, Harry!' said Mr Weasley, turning from Hermione's parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. 'Well - shall we do it, then?'\n    'Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,' said Moody.\n    He and Mr Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group.\n    'Good afternoon,' said Mr Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him. 'You might remember me, my name's Arthur Weasley.'\n    As Mr Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys' living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, &s though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.\n    'We thought we'd just have a few words with you about Harry,' said Mr Weasley, still smiling.\n    'Yeah,' growled Moody. 'About how he's treated when he's at your place.'\n    Uncle Vernon's moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.\n    'I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house - '\n    'I expect what you're not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,' growled Moody.\n    'Anyway, that's not the point,' interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. 'The point is, if we find out you've been horrible to Harry - '\n    - And make no mistake, we'll hear about it,' added Lupin pleasantly.\n    'Yes,' said Mr Weasley, 'even if you won't let Harry use the felly-tone -\n    'Telephone,' whispered Hermione.\n    - Yeah, if we get", ". It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\n\"What did he do when he saw you?\"\n\"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand\ngesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well ?that is\" ?he did the hand gesture again ?\"but why isn't he out there bullying first years?\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\n\"Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Harry. \"I think he's ?quot;\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.\n\"I'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\" she faltered, as her eyes met Harry's and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\n\"What is it?\" Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n\"An invitation,\" said Harry.?/p> \nHarry,\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\nSincerely, . , .\n\"But what does he want me for?\" asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n\"No idea,\" said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \"Listen,\" he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \"let's go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he's up to.\"\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn's only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn's welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n\"Harry, m'boy!\" said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden\nbuttons on his waistcoat. \"Good to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\"\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\n\"Now, do you know everyone?\" Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \"Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course -?\"\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\n\"This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you've come across each other ?? No?\"\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n\"?and this is Marcus Belby, I don't know whether ??\"\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.\n\"?and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\" Slughorn finished.\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn's back.\n\"Well now, this is most pleasant,\" said Slughorn cozily. \"A chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I've packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on\nlicorice wands, and a poor old man's digestive system isn't quite up to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?\"\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\n\"I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\" Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \"Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\"\nUnfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\n\"Anapneo,\" said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\n\"Not. . . not much of him, no,\" gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\n\"Well, of course, I daresay he's busy,\" said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \"I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\"\n\"I suppose . . .\" said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \"Er ... he and my dad don't get on very well, you see, so I don't really know much about...\"\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\n\"Now, you, Cormac,\" said Slughorn, \"I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\"\n\"Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\" said McLaggen. \"We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour ?this was before he became Minister, obviously ?quot;\n\"Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\" beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \"Now tell me . . .\"\nIt was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential ?everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville's interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents' flair.\n\"And now,\" said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. \"Harry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \"'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!\"\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\n\"Of course,\" said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \"there have been rumors for years. ...", ", tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore. \n\"Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous. \n\"But one of them jumped,\" he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore's. \"When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\" \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\" Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry's bewildered expression. \n\"Oh . . . right. . .\" said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead ... It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn't seen Ginny at all. . . \n\"Nearly there,\" said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. \"Careful not to touch the water,\" said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat. \nThe island was no larger than Dumbledore's office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-uid emitting that phosphorescent glow. \n\"What is it?\" asked Harry quietly. \n\"I am not sure,\" said Dumbledore. \"Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\" Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. \n\"Sir, no, don't touch \u2014 !\" \n\"I cannot touch,\" said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \"See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\" \nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air. \n\"Out of the way, please, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the-potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore with-drew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again. \n\"You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\" \n\"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. \"But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-etrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.\" Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. \"I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\" \n\"What?\" said Harry. \"No!\" \n\"Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\" \n\"But what if\u2014 what if it kills you?\" \n\"Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,\" said Dumbledore easily. \"Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.\" Harry couldn't believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore's insane determination to see good in everyone? \n\"Sir,\" said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \"sir, this is Voldemort we're \u2014\" \n\"I'm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to im-mediately kill the person who reached this island,\" Dumbledore corrected himself. \"He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-fenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.\" \nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. \"Undoubtedly,\" he said, finally, \"this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-tracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?\" \nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along \u2014 so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain? \n\"You remember,\" said Dumbledore, \"the condition on which I brought you with me?\" \nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin. \n\"But what if\u2014?\" \n\"You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\" \n\"Yes, but\u2014\" \n\"I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\" \n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but \u2014\" \n\"Well, then,\" said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \"you have my orders.\" \n\"Why can't I drink the potion instead?\" asked Harry desperately. \n\"Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\" said Dumbledore. \"Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\" \n\"Couldn't \u2014 ?\" \n\"Do I have it?\" \n\"But\u2014\" \n\"Your word, Harry.\" \n\"I \u2014all right, but\u2014\" \nBefore Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore low-ered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the gob-let, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. \"Your good health, Harry.\" \nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb. \n\"Professor?\" he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \"How do you feel?\" \nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more. \nIn silence, Dumbled", "gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\n\u3000\u3000\"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\"\n\u3000\u3000It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose.\n\u3000\u3000The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\n\u3000\u3000HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran.\n\u3000\u3000One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\"\n\u3000\u3000shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\n\u3000\u3000Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.\n\u3000\u3000Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy - Mullet - Mo ran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.\n\u3000\u3000The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\n\u3000\u3000\"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova - oh I say!\" roared Bagman.\n\u3000\u3000One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was - \"They're going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry.\n\u3000\u3000She was half right - at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.\n\u3000\u3000\"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"It's time-out!\" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course... .\"\n\u3000\u3000Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.\n\u3000\u3000He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT -DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.\n\u3000\u3000Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his\n\u3000\u3000Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\n\u3000\u3000After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals.\n\u3000\u3000They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.\n\u3000\u3000As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.\n\u3000\u3000\"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing -- excessive use of elbows!\"\n\u3000\u3000Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And - yes, it's a penalty to Ireland!\"\n\u3000\u3000The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again."]
