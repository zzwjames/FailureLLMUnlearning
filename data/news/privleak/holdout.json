["oness Heyhoe Flint, vice-president of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club, passed away in the early hours of Wednesday after a short illness.\n\nShe leaves behind husband Derrick, their son Ben, and her stepchildren Rowan, Hazel and Simon. Ben said the family was \"deeply saddened\".\n\nHeyhoe Flint, pictured with Wolves legend Steve Bull, was vice-president of the football club\n\nShe also played in the first ever women's match at Lord's, against Australia, in 1976.\n\nDuring her career she played 22 Test matches and 23 one-day internationals. She was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nShe also became a successful journalist, after dinner speaker and expert in public relations, which brought her back into contact with her beloved Wolves as she headed up the club's work in the local community.\n\nMCC president Matthew Fleming said: \"Rachael Heyhoe Flint was a pioneer of women's cricket - she was the first global superstar in the women's game and her overall contribution to the MCC, cricket and sport in general was immense.\"\n\nBaroness Heyhoe Flint has been described as a pioneer of women's cricket\n\nClare Connor, the ECB's director of women's cricket, said: \"She was so special, so ever-present and now she has gone - but her impact can never be forgotten.\n\n\"Rachael was one of our sport's true pioneers and it is no exaggeration to say that she paved the way for the progress enjoyed by recent generations of female cricketers.\"\n\nAmong many others paying tribute to Heyhoe Flint was BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew, who said on Twitter: \"Very sad news re Rachael Heyhoe Flint. Great champion of women's cricket, won first World Cup and one of life's real enthusiasts. #RIP.\"\n\nClare Connor, pictured with Heyhoe Flint, said her impact could never be forgotten\n\nHeyhoe Flint's development of cricket was \"immense\", the ECB said in tribute\n\nFlags were flying at half mast at Lord's and Wolves' Molineux stadium.\n\nThe club's players will also be wearing black armbands at Saturday's Championship game at Norwich.\n\nWolves managing director Laurie Dalrymple said: \"Everyone at Wolves is deeply saddened to hear the news that Rachael has passed away.\n\n\"She was a wonderful lady who meant so much to so many people at the football club, in the city of Wolverhampton, and also much further afield.\n\n\"Rachael's contribution to the world of sport, the local community, and in later years politics, cannot be measured, and neither can her seemingly never-ending kindness and generosity of spirit.\"\n\nThe England Cricket Board said her development of cricket had been \"immense\".\n\nBaroness Heyhoe Flint was one of the first women admitted to the MCC\n\nWhen her playing career ended, Heyhoe Flint became one of the first women admitted to the MCC. In 2004 she became the first woman elected to the full committee.\n\nShe was awarded the MBE in 1972, the OBE in 2008 and was made a life peer in 2011.\n\nA waxwork of Donald Trump has been unveiled at Madame Tussauds in central London ahead of the President-elect's inauguration.\n\nMr Trump's doppelganger replaces Barack Obama's waxwork in the set and joins various other world leaders at the attraction, including Vladimir Putin and Nelson Mandela.\n\nMr Trump will be sworn in as the 45th US president on Friday.\n\nApp users should tap on the image to compare the real Donald Trump with the waxwork\n\nJeremy Bowen reports from the ruins of eastern Aleppo where 40,000 people have returned home.\n\nIt has been a remarkable few weeks for the health service hasn't it? The worst waiting times in A&E for over a decade. Patients left for hours on trolleys. Vital cancer operations being cancelled. Hospitals across the country declaring major alerts. A humanitarian crisis in the making, says the Red Cross.\n\nBut amid all this what we haven't heard is just how well the health service is coping. Given what it is facing, the NHS and, in particular, hospitals are performing miracles.\n\nHow? Let me explain. The NHS is in the middle of the most sustained squeeze on its funding in its history. Until 2010, the budget increased by an average of about 4% a year once inflation is taken into account to help it cope with rising pressures.\n\nSince then, the average annual rise has been around 1% - and that will continue until 2020. The only period that comes close is the early 1950s when there was a cut in the NHS budget, prompting charging to be brought in for dentistry, prescriptions and spectacles.\n\nAnd that was pretty quickly followed by large cash injections to get the NHS back on track.\n\nThere's nothing like that this time. Instead, the health service is being asked to carry on as normal with fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than many other developed countries - as the graphs below illustrate.\n\nNow international comparisons can be difficult. You could argue, for example, that Germany only has so many more beds because its counts long-stay beds reserved for elderly people in its health figures whereas in the NHS they come under the nursing home sector, which is separate.\n\nNonetheless they pose an interesting question: are we simply expecting too much of the NHS?\n\nAnita Charlesworth, a health economist at the Health Foundation think tank and former Treasury official, thinks so. She says the NHS is being asked to provide \"world class access\" without the corresponding levels of funding and staff.\n\nLooked at like that, it puts the recent performance in a slightly different light.\n\nFaced with rising numbers coming in the front door (A&E) and increasing difficulty getting patients out the back (because of cuts to social care services), hospitals in England have found themselves full-to-bursting.\n\nIn recent weeks, bed occupancy rates have hit 95%. Now that may not sound like the definition of being full, but it is well above the 85% recommended threshold for a hospital to work effectively.\n\nAbove this level hospitals start to unravel, patients end up in the wrong places, infection rates start to rise and a backlog of patients builds up in corridors, in A&E and outside in ambulances dropping patients off.\n\nYes, some of this has started happening, but in many respects you would have expected performance to deteriorate even more than it has.\n\nDuring the first week of the year - the most difficult so far this winter - more than three-quarters of patients arriving in A&E were still seen in four hours.\n\nYes the rate of-called \"trolley waits\" - where patients admitted as an emergency are left waiting more than four hours for a bed - doubled to one in five patients. But the number of \"dire\" 12-hour waits only amounted to 0.5%.\n\nA week later bed occupancy rates had risen slightly - and guess what happened? Performance actually improved on many measures.\n\nAsk anybody working in the health service and they will say this is down to the dedication and hard work of hospital staff.\n\nLord Kerslake, chairman of King's College Hospital in London and a former senior civil servant, has described the efforts of staff at his hospital as \"extraordinary\", while the BBC coverage over the past week or so has been full of doctors, nurses and managers recounting how everyone is pulling together.\n\nBut there is more to it than that. The NHS has become very adept at managing pressure points. Daily reports are sent from hospitals to NHS Improvement, a newly-created regulator, about everything from the number of ambulances queuing outside A&Es to how many patients are stuck on trolleys inside.\n\nIt means when there is a problem resources are immediately deployed by bosses at the centre.\n\nExtra managers are deployed, GPs and council care staff geed up and beds at local nursing homes used to move patients out of hospital.\n\nThe result has been that the NHS has been able to - by and large - prevent the situation spiralling completely out of control and into a full-blown national crisis.\n\nThose involved in the process speak in admiration of the way the regulator", "\n\nLondon was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War.\n\nAn exhibition at Bletchley Park tells the story of the Zimmermann Telegram\n\nWhen the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram.\n\nRoom 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram.\n\nBritain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends.\n\nBritain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War.\n\nEventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London.\n\nThis meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" President Wilson said when he was told of the details.\n\nThe telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation).\n\nWhatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it. A month later, America was in the War.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson took the United States into World War One in April 1917\n\nIt would be too much to claim the Zimmermann Telegram single-handedly brought America into the War.\n\nGermany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare can take more credit for that.\n\nBut the telegram was useful for convincing the American public that it should be sending its men over to Europe to fight.\n\nThe telegram had proved the perfect justification for a change of policy and to convince some of the sceptics.\n\nIt was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One.\n\nIt was also an early sign of the potential impact of intercepting communications, a lesson which the few British and American officials in on the real story were determined to learn from as they set about building their capability.\n\nEarly in World War Two, before America had formally entered the War, it would send a team of its best code-breakers on a clandestine mission to Britain to establish a relationship with their counterparts.\n\nThe Road to Bletchley Park exhibition at the former wartime site features a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram and details of its role.\n\nToday, the two allies have GCHQ and the NSA - two vast intelligence agencies involved in interception and code-breaking.\n\nThey also have a pact which means that - on the whole - they are not supposed to spy on each other.\n\nThe BBC World Service Witness programme recently told the story of how the British managed to intercept the telegram, and heard from some of the code-breakers involved.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nViners are paying tribute to the video sharing app as it shuts down after four years.\n\nTwitter announced it was closing the six-second clip-sharing service in October but it's still not clear why.\n\nAround the same time it said it was cutting 9% of its workforce following slow growth of the social network.\n\n\"I was still enjoying the platform and it's a great shame it's closing,\" explains Daz Black, the most followed British Viner.\n\nDaz has more than three million followers on his channel, where his comedies and character impressions have been looped (viewed) more than one billion times.\n\nThe 31-year-old says he is \"saddened\" and \"annoyed\" at Twitter's decision to close the app.\n\n\"It's got me to where I am today and opened the door to so many opportunities,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\nDaz has been able to pursue acting, something he's wanted to do since he was a child and has already starred in a feature film.\n\n\"The app itself became so big, so quickly, that no-one really knew what to do with it,\" he says.\n\n\"I managed to get 100 followers in a week and I couldn't get that in three years on YouTube.\"\n\nDaz had tried - unsuccessfully - to carve out a career as a YouTuber but that changed in 2013 when he posted a Vine that hit the top of the popular page.\n\nWarning: Third party content might contain ads\n\n\"I gained about 50,000 new followers, which at the time was unheard of,\" he explains.\n\n\"I actually tried to get in touch with someone from Vine to see if someone had bought my account fake followers.\n\n\"When I hit a million followers I said I didn't want to put all my eggs in one basket and I'm really glad that I didn't.\"\n\nHe started posting on Instagram and YouTube and admits \"some amazing companies\" have paid him to feature their products in clips but won't say more.\n\nAnother Viner, Ben Phillips, has admitted to earning \u00a312,000 from Ford for a six-second clip, allowing him to be a full-time creator of video.\n\nThe 23-year-old wouldn't discuss specific details about commercial opportunities but did say: \"I never get asked to put the price in of the product.\n\n\"I just get asked if I can have a bit of fun with their product.\"\n\nBen says he wasn't that surprised Twitter decided to shut Vine and decided to leave before Twitter's announcement last year.\n\nSpeaking to Newsbeat he says: \"Vine just didn't keep with the creator and the influencer.\n\n\"They lost sight of what Vine actually was.

It said he should also be compensated for his \"deprivation of liberty\".\n\nThe UK Foreign Office, however, rejected the ruling.\n\nMr Assange's legal team have maintained his confinement to the embassy amounts to illegal detention.\n\nResponding to Ms Espinosa's comments, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The Government of Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice.\"\n\nThe sexual assault allegations against Mr Assange were dropped in May 2017.\n\nAt the time, Ecuador said the UK should guarantee him \"safe passage\" to Ecuador if he leaves the embassy.\n\nMarylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality.\n\nThe data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country.\n\nHowever, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air.\n\nDiesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease.\n\nWhile this study only concentrates on NO2 pollution, scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present.\n\nYou can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below. The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland.\n\nSorry, your browser does not support this tool How polluted is your street?\n\nIf you cannot view the postcode search, please click here to reload the page.\n\nAlthough dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems.\n\nA new analysis by the company EarthSense shows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain.\n\n\"By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions.\"\n\nAir pollution levels in London could stay above legal limits for the next decade if action isn't taken\n\nProf Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside.\n\n\"Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries - particularly across Asia.\n\n\"In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas.\"\n\nIn the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1).\n\nThe scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.\n\nFewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.\n\nThree-quarters of the postcodes with the worst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways.\n\nThree-quarters of the postcodes which reach level five out of six are in London\n\nThe company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK", "partnership work of Police Scotland, Fisheries Management Scotland and District Salmon Fisheries Boards.\n\n\"Conversely, it is disappointing to note an increase in hunting with dogs offences.

We look forward to receiving the evidence and defending him against these charges.\"\n\nCanadian reports said the alleged offences took place between 14 October and 30 December.\n\nThe couple were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network.\n\nAfter their release, Mr Boyle told the media that their captors had killed a fourth child and said they had raped his wife.\n\nThe couple have been living in Canada since their rescue.\n\nIn December, the family met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and images of the meeting were shared on the Boyle's Twitter account.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Medieval\": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row\n\nA council leader has called for action to tackle \"aggressive begging\" in Windsor, ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nSimon Dudley, of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, has called on the Berkshire police and crime commissioner (PCC) to address the issue \"urgently\".\n\nMr Dudley said street begging created a \"hostile atmosphere\" for both residents and tourists.\n\nWindsor Homeless Project described the comments as \"abhorrent\".\n\nIn December Mr Dudley tweeted about an \"epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy\" in the town.\n\nHe said he would be asking Thames Valley Police and the PCC to \"focus on dealing with this before the royal wedding\".\n\nHe went on to describe how \"vagrancy and begging\" meant people were \"marching tourists to cash points to withdraw cash\" - although Thames Valley Police said it had received no such reports.\n\nMr Dudley also said some people were earning hundreds of pounds a week targeting tourists and residents in Windsor.\n\nIn his letter on Tuesday to PCC Anthony Stansfeld, the Conservative councillor said: \"The whole situation... presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light.\n\nHe wrote: \"The level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the royal wedding in May 2018, and there are increased concerns from our residents about their safety.\"\n\nThe couple will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in May\n\nHe said many beggars were not homeless and called for \"immediate action, as this is a significant security concern, especially given the national importance of Windsor\".\n\nWindsor Homeless Project manager Murphy James said it was \"sickening\" that Mr Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for his concerns.\n\nHe said: \"If somebody is sleeping out on the street they are not there by choice; they are there because something has gone wrong.\n\n\"I went out on Christmas Day and there were 12 people laid out on Windsor High Street - they were not there by choice.\"\n\nMr Stansfeld said the council had not raised the issue with him on his last visit there but said supporting the homeless was a \"priority\".\n\nHe also said protecting the public was \"of the utmost importance... and the force work day in and day out to keep people safe from harm and make the Thames Valley a safe place to live, work and visit\".\n\nWindsor has been described as a \"very special place\" for Prince Harry and Miss Markle, who have spent time there together since meeting in July 2016.\n\nThey will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 19 May.\n\u2022 None Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May\n\nA serious flaw in the design of Intel's chips will require Microsoft, Linux and Apple to update operating systems for computers around the world.\n\nIt is believed to affect chips in millions of computers from the last decade.\n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was aware of the issue and that patches were being produced.\n\nIn response, Intel said the issue was not limited to its processors and that it was working on a fix.\n\n\"Based on analysis to date, many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIt said it was working to \"develop an industry-wide approach to resolve this issue promptly and constructively\".\n\n\"Intel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,\" it said.\n\nOften when researchers discover a security problem, they share the information with the affected company so the issue can be fixed.\n\nTypically, both parties agree not to publicise the problem until a fix has been implemented, so that criminals cannot take advantage of the issue.\n\nThis time it looks like somebody jumped the gun and information was leaked before a software fix was ready for distribution.\n\nIntel said it had planned to share information next week, and several security researchers have tweeted that they have made a secrecy pact with the chip-maker.\n\nThat leaves the company in an uncomfortable situation, with a widely-publicised problem before the fix is ready to go.\n\nExperts have said that the fix could slow down the performance of computers by up to 30% but Intel played this down, saying that \"for the average user, performance impacts should not be significant and will be mitigated over time\".\n\nIn response to the news, the NCSC said: \"We are aware of reports about a potential flaw affecting some computer processors. At this stage there is no evidence of any malicious exploitation and patches are being produced for the major platforms.\"\n\n\"The NCSC advises that all organisations and home users continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.\"\n\nThe flaw is also likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure and Google, according to The Register, which broke news of the bug.\n\nShares in Intel were down almost 6% in US trading after the issue was revealed, and ended the trading session close 3.4% lower.\n\n\"It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\n\"The actual flaw is being rather tightly kept under wraps but from what researchers have gleaned themselves, it's all to do with a flaw in the way certain Intel CPUs address certain types of memory.\n\n\"If it is really bad then it may allow an exploit to read parts of the computer memory that should never be reached.\"\n\nAndy Tsege has not seen his wife or three children since his arrest in 2014\n\nThe wife of a British man imprisoned in Ethiopia has said she feels \"optimistic\" after the government said it would free its political prisoners.\n\nOpposition activist Andargachew 'Andy' Tsege was seized nearly four years ago in Yemen and taken to Ethiopia.\n\nHis wife Yemi Hailemariam, who lives in Islington, north London, told the BBC she is \"hopeful\" but has her doubts until she hears more.\n\nIt was unclear from Hailemariam Desalegn's surprise announcement exactly who will be released or when it will happen.\n\nMr Andargachew, a UK national, has been in prison in Ethiopia since being arrested during a stopover at a Yemen airport in June 2014.\n\nThe father of three was sentenced to death while in exile for plotting a coup - which he denied.\n\nMr Andargachew had been secretary-general of Ethiopia's banned Ginbot 7", "He may have been the heir to Blair, but he did not inherit the Blair spin machine.\n\nOr rather he believed that if he appealed directly to the people they would listen to what he had to say and respect his wisdom.\n\nTheresa May has been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself\n\nIn the end that was to bring him down with the EU referendum result.\n\nSo now, another \"new dawn\", another prime minister, another approach to getting the message across.\n\nTheresa May told us she won't give a running commentary on Brexit. Nor has there been.\n\nOn the contrary, this is a prime minister who's been attacked for keeping her true thoughts to herself - so far at least.\n\nThat may change in the coming days when we find out what she really means when she tells us Brexit means Brexit. But still, hard to imagine her doing a Thatcher and discussing theology at 08:10 on the Today programme.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nChelsea Football Club have been given permission by the local council to build a new \u00a3500m 60,000-seat stadium.\n\nHammersmith and Fulham council's planning committee have backed plans to demolish the current 41,600-capacity Stamford Bridge stadium.\n\nThe plans include a walkway from the nearby District Line station.\n\n\"We are grateful that planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of our historic home,\" Chelsea said in a statement.\n\n\"The committee decision does not mean that work can begin on site. This is just the latest step, although a significant one, that we have to take before we can commence work, including obtaining various other permissions.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan will have the final say on whether Chelsea can build their new stadium.\n\nThe new stadium has been designed by architects Herzog and de Meuron, who were also responsible for the \"Birds Nest\" Olympic stadium in Beijing.\n\nThe proposals could mean owner Roman Abramovich has to find a temporary home for the current Premier League leaders for up to three years, with both Twickenham Stadium and Wembley Stadium being looked at as possible options.\n\nAn artist's impression of the proposed new Stamford Bridge stadium\n\nChelsea might, however, struggle to use Wembley as north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will occupy the national stadium for at least the 2017-18 football season as work finishes on Spurs' own new 61,000-capacity stadium.\n\nChelsea could stay at Stamford Bridge while the work takes place but this is thought to be the most expensive option.\n\nThe plans showing the outline of the new Chelsea stadium at Stamford Bridge including a new walkway to the ground from Fulham Broadway Tube station\n\nMr Abramovich has wanted to increase capacity at Chelsea on match days for a number of years.\n\nHe previously attempted to buy Battersea Power Station with a view to redeveloping the site into a new stadium, ultimately losing out to property developers who are currently building luxury apartments at the site.\n\nTen years ago Arsenal built the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium, last summer West Ham moved to the 57,000-capacity Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, and Spurs are currently redeveloping their White Hart Lane ground.\n\nThe current 41,663-capacity Stamford Bridge is the seventh biggest stadium used by a Premier League team, well behind Manchester United's 76,000-seater stadium at Old Trafford.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nUS Democrats say that President-elect Trump's plans to employ his son-in-law as a special adviser may be in breach of anti-nepotism laws.\n\nHistory is littered with examples of people giving out - and just being accused of giving out - jobs to their nearest and dearest.

the economy and the supremacy of London as Europe's financial capital being two of them.\n\nBut the rest of the European Union also faces risks.\n\nAnd, according to the governor, those risks are greater for the continent.\n\nTo be clear, Mr Carney was talking about financial stability, not economic growth - although of course the two are closely intertwined.\n\nIf financial stability is compromised, or liquidity conditions deteriorate, then economic growth is likely to be adversely affected.\n\nIn his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney made three major points.\n\nFirst, the UK's financial services sector provides 75% of foreign exchange trading for the EU, 75% of all hedging products (which help businesses insure against risk when making investments or buying products) and supports half of all lending.\n\nAs he said in November, the UK is Europe's \"investment banker\".\n\nA sharp break in that liquidity and capacity support could be detrimental to financial stability in the EU.\n\nAlex Brazier, the executive director for financial stability at the Bank, said that the UK exports \u00a326bn of financial services to the EU, and imports just \u00a33bn.\n\nWhich, he said, makes the point.\n\nSecond, as far as the UK is concerned, Brexit is no longer the biggest risk to financial stability.\n\nNow, that may be leapt on by the Bank's critics - the governor has changed his tune, it could be said, given that before the referendum Brexit was seen as the biggest risk.\n\nMr Carney said the UK economy is performing better than expected\n\nBut Mr Carney made it clear - the mitigating actions the Bank has taken since the referendum (a cut in interest rates and more financial support for banks and businesses) have, according to the governor, worked.\n\nBetter economic news than many predicted has also maintained confidence - and the governor suggested that the Bank was now looking at upgrading the UK economic forecasts for 2017.\n\nThird, transitional arrangements would be a positive help to smoothing the process of Brexit, avoiding what has been described as a \"cliff edge\" exit which may occur at the end of the two year Article 50 process.\n\nMany in the City believe that given the complexities of the financial relationships between London and the rest of Europe, two years will simply not be enough time to build new regulatory and financial structures.\n\nA period of \"adaption\" will be necessary.\n\nMr Carney's comments are likely to be welcomed in Number 10 and the Treasury.\n\nThe government believes that, whatever the present noises about the toughness of the EU position on Brexit flexibility, the role London plays in supporting the rest of the EU economy will be an important part of the negotiations.\n\nBusiness leaders across the EU will want to maintain full access to UK's deep financial markets and widespread expertise.\n\nAnd that will help Theresa May's push for the \"closest trading relationship\" with the EU, even if Britain does leave the single market as it is presently constituted.\n\nSome believe this a forlorn hope, suggesting that political positions in the EU are hardening, not softening, towards the UK.\n\nBut, the more the warnings come from people like Mr Carney that Europe might just need the UK's financial muscle, the stronger Mrs May's negotiating hand will be.\n\nLast updated on .From the section European Football\n\nBarcelona's ability to offer Lionel Messi an improved contract will rest on their capacity to raise revenue from sponsorship deals and player sales, chief executive Oscar Grau says.\n\nMessi's contract expires in 2018 and he is expected to command a new deal on a par with the reported \u00a321m a year earned by Luis Suarez and Neymar.\n\nBut La Liga's salary cap means Barca must exercise common sense, Grau said.\n\n\"We want the best players but perhaps we have to prioritise,\" he added.\n\nLa Liga agrees budgetary limits with each club at the start of every season, which prevents boards from spending more than 70% of their budget on wages.\n\nThe big-money contracts awarded to Messi's fellow forwards Suarez and Neymar, which run until 2021, eat into a significant part of their wage budget, which must also absorb an average player sal", "Davos last week.\n\nAsked why consumer confidence hadn't collapsed following the referendum - or at least had recovered strongly after some initial uncertainty - Mr Fink answered that for lots of people who voted for Brexit or who voted for Donald Trump, the victories were not a negative event.\n\n\"They won,\" he said, simply felt good and kept spending. \"Car sales went up.\"\n\nFor the UK economy, it is worth considering two points.\n\nThe Bank of England increased financial support for businesses after the Brexit vote\n\nFirst, the gloomy forecasts before the referendum about the possible effects of a vote to leave the European Union were based on Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the EU, being triggered immediately after the vote as David Cameron promised.\n\nThat could have led to a chaotic departure from the EU and certainly would have created greater economic dislocation.\n\nSecond, the Bank of England cut interest rates and increased financial support for businesses and banks, soothing market fears.\n\nThese two points are not enough to explain all of the resilience in the economy, but they go some of the way.\n\nIn my interview with the chancellor, he admitted that he was now \"more optimistic\" about the process of leaving the EU and the single market.\n\nHe said that European leaders were no longer in chastising mood over Brexit, that had now past.\n\nA good deal is on, he said.\n\nA weaker pound is set to push up the price of everyday goods\n\nBut, and of course there has to be a but when considering how an economy will perform - a judgement at its most basic on how a million different decisions by human beings will play out.\n\nThe rate of inflation is increasing as the value of sterling declines.\n\nJobs are being moved out of the UK and on to the continent in sectors such as banking and finance as businesses prepare for Brexit.\n\nThe UK has, of course, not actually left the EU yet and at the moment is enjoying the stimulus of being in the EU's huge single market with a considerably weaker currency.\n\nThat goldilocks situation will not last and the chancellor told me of his concerns about business investment.\n\nIt was the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that shocks to an economy can boost growth.\n\n\"Creative destruction\" may be a little strong to describe the Brexit vote, but innovation can flow when the demands of uncertainty rise.\n\nAfter Britain fell out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor of the single currency, many predicted that inflation would rise and economic growth would stutter.\n\nIn fact, the UK economy bounced back, inflation remained in check and the pound rose - after an initial fall.\n\nThat is not to say that all \"dynamic\" shocks have such an effect.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008-09 has negatively affected economic growth for far longer than most expected as the financial services sector contracted rapidly, liquidity disappeared and businesses and consumers paid down debt.\n\nThat is why it is still too early to say definitively whether the robust state of the UK economy today means the forecasts for economic pain made before the Brexit vote can now be safely ignored.\n\nJavaScript seems to be disabled.

Everyone in the unit executed the plans we talked about. We showed a lot of experience.\n\n\"The opening batsmen got off to a flier and that releases any pressure on the guys coming in after them. Sam Billings hasn't played much this tour but he has taken his chances when he has had an opportunity.\"\n\nIndia captain Virat Kohli: \"England played better cricket - with the ball and the bat they were precise. They were deserving winners and we need to stand up and applaud them.\n\n\"This is a format you need to enjoy and play at your intense best. We need to address the things we want to and not take too much stress from this. We need to just enjoy and not put too much pressure on the youngsters.\"\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on Twitter: \"Not many teams give India a T20 masterclass, especially not in their own back yard.

YouTube said it \u201cworked to aggressively enforce our monetisation policies to eliminate the incentive for this abuse\u201d.\n\nBut enforcing its new rules on pranks may prove even more difficult, given ambiguity over what may or may not be considered harmful.\n\n\u201cYouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks,\u201d a message added to the site\u2019s FAQ section read.\n\n\u201cThat said, we\u2019ve always had policies to make sure what\u2019s funny doesn\u2019t cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous.\n\n\u201cOur Community Guidelines prohibit content that encourages dangerous activities that are likely to result in serious harm, and today clarifying what this means for dangerous challenges and pranks.\u201d\n\nFrom now on, the site said it would not allow videos that featured \u201cpranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury\".\n\nThis includes pranks where someone is tricked into thinking they are in severe danger, even if no real threat existed.\n\nThe site added: \u201cWe also don\u2019t allow pranks that cause children to experience severe emotional distress, meaning something so bad that it could leave the child traumatized for life.\u201d\n\nYouTube said it had worked closely with child psychologists on what might constitute a traumatic experience. It did not post a full list, but said it included scenarios where a child is tricked into believing their parents had died.\n\nThe new rules come in response to several instances of pranks and stunts that are seriously ill-advised at best, and deadly at worst.\n\nIn May, Minnesota woman Monalisa Perez, 20, was sentenced to six months in prison after shooting dead her boyfriend, Pedro Ruiz.

Has it blinked in the past? There are no exact comparisons, because Brexit is a unique situation. But here are a few examples:\n\nDenmark narrowly rejected the EU's Maastricht treaty in 1992 and subsequently negotiated four optouts from Maastricht on:\n\nThe optouts were contained in a legally binding protocol to the treaty but the main body of the text was not changed.\n\nIn a second referendum, in 1993, Denmark voted in favour.\n\nIreland has lived through two referendums on the same issue on two separate occasions.\n\nIn 2001, the country voted against the EU's Nice Treaty, mainly because voters were concerned that Irish military forces would have to take part in Nato-led peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe text of the treaty was not changed but the Irish government issued a national declaration reaffirming its military neutrality.\n\nIn a second referendum in 2002, the Nice Treaty was approved by an overwhelming margin.\n\nAgain, in 2008, Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty, citing concerns about tax, abortion and military neutrality.\n\nA second referendum, in 2009, approved Lisbon after promises were made to address these concerns.\n\nThey eventually formed a protocol that was approved in 2012 but the text of the Lisbon Treaty itself was not changed.\n\nIn 2016 an advisory referendum in the Netherlands rejected an EU trade and cooperation agreement with Ukraine. The Dutch government needed legally binding assurances from the rest of the EU before it could get the deal approved in parliament, and it got them.\n\nThey came in the form of a declaration spelling out the fact that the agreement did not make any guarantee to Ukraine of future EU membership, nor did it oblige the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with military assistance.\n\nBut the agreement with Ukraine was not changed in any way, and an equivalent outcome for the Brexit deal would fail to satisfy many Eurosceptic MPs in Westminster.\n\nA draft EU constitution was signed by all member states in October 2004 and ratified by 18 countries before being rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005.\n\nAfter licking a few wounds, the EU came up with the Lisbon Treaty, which kept many of the main provisions of the draft constitution, including a new president of the European Council and a clause on withdrawal from the EU (Article 50).\n\nBut it dropped the name \"constitution\" itself and it didn't include references to EU symbols, such as the flag and the anthem, that would normally be associated with a state.\n\nThe rejection of the constitution led to what were probably the biggest changes the EU has ever made in treaty negotiations but critics say Lisbon was still as close to the proposed constitution as it could get.\n\nBefore Brexit, the EU was dealing for years with the eurozone crisis and with Greece in particular.\n\nGreece was pushed into a financial bailout programme in 2010, accepting huge loans from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for drastic austerity measures, including tax rises and sweeping cuts in spending and pay.\n\nAfter a new government led by the radical left-wing party Syriza took office in 2015, it held a referendum in which it campaigned for an end to EU-imposed austerity.\n\nDespite substantial backing from Greek voters, Brussels (and Berlin) didn't blink.\n\nAusterity continued and the government had to apply for another bailout loan in order to stay in the eurozone.\n\nIn the run-up to the Brexit referendum in the UK, the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, tried to renegotiate aspects of the UK's membership of the European Union, in order to show voters that reform was possible.\n\nHe won recognition that the UK could opt out of the EU's founding ambition to forge an \"ever closer union\" and he was given guarantees about the rights of EU countries outside the", "no-score draw on nuclear weapons,\" added the shadow minister. \"Jeremy can be budged. Sometimes. But it takes a hell of an effort and a lot of time.\"\n\nHe was right, of course. Mr Corbyn now accepts, however unenthusiastically, that NATO is a defence alliance Britain must back and not merely a hangover from the cold war.\n\nHe has put aside his dream of Labour returning to a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He is still adamant that he would never order a nuclear strike, a flat contradiction to the principal of nuclear deterrence which Labour has yet to confront.\n\nHe has moved, nonetheless. His position, if not his thinking, has changed.\n\nNow he talks of free movement as a possible component of an EU divorce settlement still to be negotiated. That's a long way from the thinking of shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, who expressed sympathy, when I interviewed him on my Sunday morning 5 live programme, Pienaar's Politics, for the idea of limiting access to the UK jobs market to EU migrants who have a job guaranteed.\n\nBut it opened at least the possibility of further movement in future. Only a possibility, mind. The Labour leader is stubborn. Or a man of deep conviction. Take your choice.\n\nThe enthusiasts who elected and continue to sustain Mr Corbyn continue to be zealous and loyal. Supporters of free movement of people as a useful, as well as necessary element of the EU single market may welcome Mr Corbyn's reluctance to forsake them.\n\nBut a lot of Labour MPs have moved from bitter resentment to weary fatalism, hoping that, somehow, the mood among party members changes sufficiently to produce a change. Preferably a change of leader.\n\nThese include the senior Labour MP who told me privately today that his constituency - a northern stronghold with a majority of around 15,000 - now felt like a marginal seat, vulnerable to the overtures of UKIP.\n\nSome allies of Mr Corbyn had grown resentful that the mainstream media appeared to have lost interest in reporting the doings of Labour, or analysing the party's policy development.\n\nNo-one can make the same complaint today. I'm not sure the party's position is any happier as a result.\n\nChampionship side Leeds United avoid an FA Cup third-round upset as they fight back to win 2-1 at League Two opponents Cambridge United.\n\nWatch all the best action from the FA Cup third round here.\n\nAvailable to UK users only.\n\nPakistan's military says it has test launched a submarine cruise missile from the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe nuclear-capable missile is seen flying over the coast and hitting its flag target.\n\nI wrote on this blog in December that titles such as the Telegraph or Express might be for sale in 2017.\n\nOvernight, it has been revealed that Trinity Mirror PLC has been in discussion with Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell about taking a minority interest in a new company which would - probably but not certainly - include the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star, Daily Star Sunday and their websites.\n\nTrinity's interest in the Express titles goes back years. But there is a much bigger story going on here.\n\nThe man behind a deal to potentially take these titles off Richard Desmond is none other than David Montgomery, the former editor of the News of the World and Today who went on to become a major investor in media.\n\nOver recent months, Montgomery has been trying to raise the necessary finances, speaking to several banks, as well as equity partners.\n\nMontgomery is being advised by Lloyds, Bank of Canada, and the familiar figure of Jonnie Goodwin of Lepe Partners.\n\nBefore Christmas, he had raised \u00a3125m. This comprises \u00a360m of debt finance, \u00a310m from Montgomery, \u00a330m from other equity backers - and \u00a325m from Trinity Mirror.\n\nMark Kleinman of Sky News has reported that the investors Montgomery is speaking to include Towebrook Capital Partners. I have not been able to verify this yet myself.\n\nRichard Desmond, who bought the Express titles in 2000, spoke to me about his intentions.\n\nIn May last year, Express Newspapers, which is part of Northern & Shell, announced it had tripled pre-tax profits in 2015 to \u00a330.5m.\n\nDesmond told me that with OK! Magazine doing well, and his printworks in Luton owning assets now worth \"around \u00a3100m\", Express Newspapers was making around \u00a350m.\n\nI asked Desmond if he was intent on selling to Montgomery and had received an offer.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk, nothing has happened. I haven't had an offer.\" Asked specifically if he wished to sell Express Newspapers, Desmond said: \"Why would I? You tell me, why would I?\"\n\nBut he swiftly added that he was \"interested in everything\".\n\nAsked if he would demand a five-times multiple of profits for Express Newspapers, he said: \"Why wouldn't I?\"\n\nDesmond hasn't seen Montgomery since his Christmas party. \"My people have been speaking loads to his management.\"\n\nHis preference, as things stand, is to consolidate back-office staff rather than sell Express Newspapers - though he would, of course, entertain the latter option if he was offered a suitable price.\n\n\"If we can bring in a minority partner to share back-office staff, that could save tens of millions,\" he added.\n\nHe specifically referred to \"IT, ad sales\" in reference to these back-office operations.\n\nUsing what were clearly ballpark figures on a deal that hasn't yet transpired, about an entity not yet clearly defined, Desmond told me the savings for Trinity Mirror of a combined company could be around \u00a330m, and for Desmond they could be around \u00a360m.\n\n\"If Trinity then owned 20% of the new company, which should make \u00a380m, that's \u00a316m.\"\n\nI should urge caution about these figures, because Desmond himself did: when I asked what exactly would make \u00a380m, he was open that this was a generalisation about a possible future company.\n\nDesmond is a brilliant deal-maker who sold Channel 5 to Viacom for \u00a3463m in 2014, having bought it in 2010 for just \u00a3103.5m.\n\nBy the way, Viacom has had an excellent two years with Channel 5, with ratings up, in the years since that sale.\n\nHe didn't give me the impression he is keen to get out of media in a hurry.\n\nI asked David Montgomery if the above figures were accurate and indeed whether he was being advised by those I mention above.\n\nAt the time of writing he hadn't responded to my queries.\n\nI asked a Trinity Mirror PLC spokesman whether the \u00a325m figure was accurate.\n\nI have spoken to multiple sources across the industry about the likelihood of a deal going through between Montgomery and Desmond. As things stand, it is very uncertain.\n\nDesmond won't sell for a knockdown price: after all, he has stable profits.\n\nAnd any consolidation of back-office operations depends on a huge range of specifics that are yet to be hammered out.\n\nBut as I have repeatedly said on this blog, there is a coming consolidation in the media sector, and indeed in over-supplied sub-sectors such as that of national newspapers in Britain.\n\nBy over-supplied I simply mean we have plenty for an island with our population.\n\nExpect more on this soon. And I will publish Montgomery's response if and when I get it.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that he does not believe that immigration to the UK was too high.\n\nBut he said that he wanted to end exploitation of workers under freedom of movement laws, a move which he believed would \"probably\" see a fall in the numbers moving to the UK.\n\nIn this full video of the interview, he also set out his thinking on the idea of a cap on maximum wages and his response to a suggestion by senior union leader Len McCluskey that he would be willing to consider his position if Labour's poll ratings remained low in 2019.\n\nIraqi forces have gained ground since launching a \"second phase\" in the operation\n\nThe announcement by the Iraqi military that its forces have reached the Tigris River for the first time in the battle for Mosul marks a significant moment in the 12-week campaign to recapture so-", "2, 36 and 57, were found at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Saturday.\n\nPolice in the western province of Vorarlberg said they were located through mobile phone tracking, near the Langer Zug slope - one of the steepest in the world.\n\nIt had been closed due to dangerous conditions.\n\nThe men were wearing touring skis, which are used to climb uphill slopes and ski off-piste.\n\nThe three victims bring the number of weather-related deaths in parts of Europe this month to at least 24, the Associated Press news agency reports.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAustria has seen record snowfall, with more forecast for the weekend.

I work 36 hours a week and he works between 16 and 18, split over a Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon which means we are at home together on a Saturday and our son only has to go to a nursery for one afternoon a week.\n\n\"It's been eight months and it's working so far.

Then it becomes a circle, like an infinite loop, that you cannot close.\n\n\"Some people advise to either not work that hard or to move to another company, but this is nonsense. Why? Because your family needs money. More money comes from higher appreciation at work. This comes from more hard work. However, it will also reduce the time you have for your family.\n\n\"In addition, the parental leave we have here in Hungary is near to nothing. We get two days of parental leave per year per child, which is not enough.

Many people struggled to accept that a man would want to spend more time at home with his kids for a while.\n\n\"I asked a few of them 'would you be so negative in the face of a woman returning to work after a prolonged child-related career break?' The answer was always 'no' and was often followed by an uncomfortable acceptance that they were regarding me differently solely because of my gender.\n\n\"It's a real eye-opener into tacit acceptance of gender-defined roles in society.

But I didn't expect that the Pakistani government would treat me like this at the end,\" Sharbat Gula told me at her temporary residence in Kabul.\n\nHer case highlighted the arbitrary arrest and forced deportation of Afghan refugees in the current spat between the two countries.\n\nIt has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s, but the law was often not enforced.\n\nNow sick and frail in her mid-40s, Sharbat Gula's haunting eyes are still piercing, full of both fear and hope.\n\nShe says she had already sold her house in Pakistan because she feared arrest there for \"not having proper documents to stay\".\n\nTwo days before a planned move back to Afghanistan, her house was raided late in the evening and she was taken to prison.\n\nSharbat Gula was sentenced to 15 days in prison\n\nPakistan's government has ordered all two million Afghan refugees on its soil to leave.\n\nSharbat Gula believes the Pakistani authorities wanted to arrest her before she left.\n\n\"I told the police that I have made this ID card for only two things - to educate my children and sell my house - which were not possible to do without the ID card.\"\n\nShe served a 15-day prison sentence, the first week in prison and the second in hospital where she was treated for hepatitis C.\n\n\"This was the hardest and worst incident in my life.\"\n\nRealising the reputational damage, Pakistan later offered to let her stay - but she refused.\n\n\"I told them that I am going to my country. I said: 'You allowed me here for 35 years, but at the end treated me like this.' It is enough.\"\n\nHer husband and eldest daughter died in Peshawar and are buried there.\n\n\"If I wanted to go back, it will be just to offer prayer at the graves of my husband and daughter who are buried in front of the house we lived in.\"\n\nThe \"Afghan Girl\" picture was taken by Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp near Peshawar, when Sharbat Gula was studying in a tent school. Published in 1985, it became one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed.\n\nFor years she was unaware of her celebrity.\n\n\"When my brother showed me the picture, I recognised myself and told him that yes, this is my photo.\"\n\n\"I became very surprised [because] I didn't like media and taking photos from childhood. At first, I was concerned about the publicity of my photo but when I found out that I have been the cause of support/help for many people/refugees, then I became happy.\"\n\nSharbat Gula has now returned to Afghanistan, where the government promised her a house in Kabul\n\nNone of Sharbat Gula's six children - another daughter died too at an early age and is buried in Peshawar - share the colour of her eyes.\n\nBut her brother, Kashar Khan, does, and the eyes of one of her three sisters were also green.\n\nShe says her maternal grandmother had eyes of a similar colour.\n\nSharbat Gula was a child living with her family in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province when Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979.\n\n\"There was war between Russians and Afghanistan - that is why we left. A lot of damage/destruction was done.\"\n\nHer mother died of appendicitis in the village when she was eight. Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, her family (her father, four sisters and one brother) migrated to Pakistan and started living in a tent in a refugee camp called Kacha Garahi, on the outskirts of Peshawar.\n\nShe was married at 13. But her husband, Rahmat Gul, was later diagnosed with hepatitis C and died about five years ago. Her eldest daughter also died of hepatitis three years ago, aged 22, leaving a two-month-old daughter.\n\nSharbat Gula met President Ashraf Ghani in the presidential palace on her return, and later former President Hamid Karzai.\n\n\"They gave me respect, warmly welcomed me. I thank them. May God treat them well.\"\n\nAfghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani received her at the presidential palace\n\nThe government has promised to support her financially and buy her a house in Kabul.\n\n\"I hope the government will fulfil all its promises,\" she told me.\n\nKot", "album, while radio stations were shunning its second single Desert Rose, a duet with Algerian rai music artist Cheb Mami.\n\nThen, in a landmark for what is now known as \"sync licensing\", the singer and his manager, Miles Copeland, had a brainwave.\n\nThe video for the song showed Sting travelling in a brand new Jaguar S-Type car. So why not approach Jaguar's advertising agency and offer them the chance to make a commercial based on the video?\n\nThe Jaguar S-Type was in production from 1999 to 2009\n\n\"He was actually in the commercial,\" says Matt Bristow, who is business affairs manager at independent UK record label Cherry Red. \"If you had gone back to Sting in the 80s and said, 'Would you fancy being in a car commercial?', he would probably have said no.\"\n\nAfter that, the single reached the top 20 in 10 countries, including the UK and the US. And since then, sync deals placing music tracks in TV commercials, TV series, films and even video games have become steadily more important as a revenue earner for the music industry.\n\nWith record companies unable to sell physical copies of their releases in the same quantities that they used to, they have sought other sources of revenue, and sync licensing is now one of the key ones.\n\nAs a result, previously obscure job categories have come to the fore as the industry rebalances to reflect this. The 21st Century has seen the rise of music supervisors, people who oversee the process of finding the right song for a scene and making sure the right people get paid for it.\n\nThese are the gatekeepers who decide which tunes you will be hearing in that latest hit TV show, the essential liaison between the creative types who make the programme and the business people who control ownership of the music.\n\nCherry Red, like other record companies, fosters relationships with music supervisors and does whatever it can to make them aware of the music it has to offer.\n\nThe Netflix series Stranger Things features one of Cherry Red's tracks\n\n\"If you go back a decade or more, I think certainly the bigger artists were not very receptive to these kinds of licences,\" says Mr Bristow. \"When a thriving physical market was still with us, there was a view that you were selling out if you did that.\n\n\"But that's changed. There's more awareness of the importance of maximising your income.\n\n\"The door has definitely been opened. Artists at all levels are more receptive to doing these kinds of deals than in the past.\"\n\nCherry Red's most notable success in sync licensing to date has been placing a song on the soundtrack on the hit Netflix show Stranger Things, which successfully applied to use the track Green Desert by German electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream.\n\n\"The approach came from Nora Felder, who is well known in the music sync world as a passionate music supervisor,\" says Mr Bristow.\n\n\"We didn't haggle over the fee,\" he adds. \"Obviously I can't tell you what it was, but it was comfortably in the ballpark of what that sort of deal would be.\"\n\nIn this case, approval was required from the recording artists. Since Tangerine Dream's frontman Edgar Froese died in 2015, his widow Bianca was the one who gave it the green light.\n\nBut the deal was not sealed until the final cut of the scene using the music had been signed off by the show's creators, at which point Cherry Red was able to invoice them for the money.\n\nTangerine Dream's Edgar Froese died in 2015 at the age of 70\n\n\"That's really great for us, it's like having a calling card when we go and see other music supervisors,\" says Mr Bristow. \"When we say we've got a track on Stranger Things, they immediately know what we're talking about.\"\n\nWhen music supervisors are seeking to obtain permission to use a track, they need to clear two different sets of rights: the rights to use the actual recorded piece of music, known as the \"master rights\", and the rights to use the written composition, or the \"publishing rights\".\n\n\"It's very attractive in the sync world when you control both rights and they can just clear with you,\" says Mr Bristow. \"It's a one-stop shop when you control both rights.\"\n\nWhen Cherry Red signs a new artist these days, the label is seeking to acquire both master and publishing rights.\n\nHowever, music publishers and record companies have different priorities and it can be hard for one firm to give equal weight to both.\n\nAs a result, musicians have traditionally been reluctant to put all their eggs in one basket, so that's another way in which the industry is having to change.\n\n\"It's an old adage that you don't put your masters and publishing in the same place. It's historically the unwritten rule in the artists' community,\" says Mr Bristow.\n\nAt present, Cherry Red controls the master rights of about 50,000 tracks and the publishing rights of about 16,000. The major labels - Universal, Sony and Warner - own far more tracks, especially the well-known big hits that are sought after by advertising agencies.\n\nBut as an indie label, Mr Bristow says, Cherry Red can be \"flexible on price\" and sometimes benefits when the song that the ad agency wanted to use turns out to be too expensive.\n\n\"When the music supervisor has been given a big-name track and they just can't clear it for the budget, they're looking for something that sounds similar,\" he says.\n\nMr Bristow says the amount of money coming in from sync licensing is set to grow. \"It's still pretty small overall, but it's increasing, the opportunities are increasing.\n\n\"The more depth and breadth in catalogue you have, the more opportunities there are in the sync world.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has announced plans to spend 2017 touring the US - in the Facebook founder's latest ambitious New Year's resolution.\n\nHe posted that this year's personal challenge is to \"have visited and met people in every state in the US\".\n\nThe 32-year-old tech titan added that he needs to travel to about 30 states to fulfil the pledge.\n\nHis previous New Year challenges have included running 365 miles, reading 25 books and learning Mandarin.\n\nThe US tour comes amid speculation that a future personal challenge by Mr Zuckerberg could include running for president of the United States.\n\n\"After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future,\" Mr Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post.\n\n\"For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected.\n\n\"This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone.\"\n\nHe added that the road trips would help him to make \"the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period\".\n\n\"My trips this year will take different forms - road trips with [wife] Priscilla, stops in small towns and universities, visits to our offices across the country, meetings with teachers and scientists, and trips to fun places you recommend along the way,\" the statement continued.\n\nLast year there was speculation that he could one day launch a bid for the White House.\n\nThat was fuelled by documents showing he has made provisions to keep control of the company if he works for the government.\n\nMr Zuckerberg also said last week that he was no longer an atheist.\n\nHe posted a Christmas message, prompting someone to ask: \"Aren't you an atheist?\"\n\nMr Zuckerberg replied: \"No. I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important\".\n\u2022 None Facebook to do more tackling fake news\n\nThree-time Olympic champion Pete Reed has announced his rowing comeback as he aims for a fourth Olympic gold medal.\n\nReed, 35, returned to his job in the Navy following last summer's Rio Olympics, where he won gold in the men's eight.\n\nBut the Briton, who also won Olympic gold in Beijing and London, now plans to compete at Tokyo 2020, when he will be", "\n\n\"The tree has been there for hundreds of years and I didn't expect there would be any problem, it's a very large, strong tree.\"\n\nStorm Eleanor is the fifth named storm to hit the UK this winter.\n\nThe Met Office warning lasts until 04:00 GMT on Wednesday.

How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars\n\nAn American YouTube star says he does not expect to be forgiven after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan.\n\nThe video showed Logan Paul and friends discovering the body in the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides.\n\nIt prompted a barrage of criticism online with some comments calling it \"disrespectful\" and \"disgusting\".\n\nPaul took down the video and later apologised saying he was \"misguided\".\n\n\"I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven,\" he said in a video apology posted to Twitter.\n\n\"I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't\", he said.\n\n\"I'm ashamed of myself,\" he added. \"I'm disappointed in myself.\"\n\nThe video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down.\n\nLogan Paul, a huge internet personality, has more than 15 million subscribers on the website and a loyal fanbase of mainly tweens and teenagers.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their lives.\n\nThe 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends.\n\nThey go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the \"haunted\" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body.\n\nPaul is visibly shocked by the discovery but also makes jokes.\n\nThe group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out.\n\nA member of the group is heard off camera saying he \"doesn't feel good\". Paul then asks him: \"What, you never stand next to a dead guy?\" He then laughs.\n\nThe identity of the deceased man is not known.\n\nOnline comments have widely accused Paul of acting inappropriately and being disrespectful. A petition calling for his entire channel to be removed from YouTube has more than 45,000 signatures.\n\nIn Japan, the reaction has been similar with many saying they are disgusted and appalled by the stupidity of his actions. Although some have pointed out that Japanese media have in the past sent camera crews and TV personalities to supposedly \"haunted\" locations.\n\nOne Twitter user said it was more important to talk about the high rates of suicide in Japan.\n\n\"Even if we try to sweep it under the rug, it doesn't change the fact that Japan is a nation prominent for suicides where 20,000 to 30,000 people commit suicide every year,\" wrote Namaikinanamako.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

He is mocking me, my country, and my culture!\"\n\nSome of Paul's supporters insisted he should be forgiven for what they said was a mistake, with one tweeting: \"You still are the best out there and always will be\" with the hashtag #Logan_you_are_forgiven.\n\nBut in an apology posted on his Twitter page, Paul, of Westlake, Ohio, said: \"For my fans who are defending my actions - please don't. They do not deserve to be defended.\"\n\nHe also said he wanted to \"make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity\", by raising awareness of suicide and suicide prevention.\n\nPaul says in the video that he chose not to monetise the content.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nYouGov based its survey on a popular meme of British phrases and their subtext.\n\nIt's not clear who came up with the table, although it's done the rounds online for several years - and was first seen by the BBC in 2011 in a blog by Oxfam.\n\nYouGov decided to show the same phrases, and each of the meanings, to about 1,700 Brits and 1,900 Americans, and asked them which matched their own interpretation the most closely.\n\nThe survey showed that some - though not all - of the stereotypes in the table were statistically correct.\n\nThere was plenty of common ground - for example, a majority of both British and US adults consider \"I was a bit disappointed that\" a polite way of saying \"I am annoyed that\" - rather than \"it doesn't really matter\".\n\nBut those in the UK are much more likely to consider \"I'll bear it in mind\" and \"I hear what you say\" to be attempts to brush you off.\n\nAnd a higher proportion of Britons than Americans (44% to 31%) think \"that is a very brave proposal\" actually means \"you are insane\".\n\nThe British have a long history of sarcasm\n\nPlenty of Americans working in the UK have complained about British passive-aggressiveness, or their annoying tendency to beat around the bush.\n\nBut UK expats have also complained about American insults directed at Brits.\n\nOne writer for BBC America came up with the following translations for American English:\n\nAt the end of the day, while the British may like to think they have a more sophisticated sense of sarcasm, they might have more in common with their American cousins than they think.\n\nThe new presenter of Question Time, Fiona Bruce, has had a warm reaction to her first time presenting the show.\n\nThursday evening's", "waiting target.\n\nA spokesman for NHS Improvement said: \"In the past few days, we've seen a real improvement in how quickly patients are being seen and discharged from accident and emergency departments - including to social care. But we know the pressures facing our hospitals will continue over the remaining weeks of winter and we're working hard to ensure they have the support they need to offer patients quick, safe, quality care.\"\n\nThe leak also reveals that, in the second week of January, 14,700 people who had been admitted to a hospital were left waiting for more than four hours to find a bed.\n\nOf these, 140 people endured so-called \"trolley waits\" of more than 12 hours. While these figures are well down on the first week in January, they remain historically high - up by 3,000 on the equivalent week two years ago.\n\nThere are further signs of vulnerability: for the week covered by the data, which runs 9 to 15 January, the number of beds in use remained an exceptionally high 95.3%, with 4.9% of the service's beds occupied because patients were stuck in hospitals awaiting transfer to another care provider (a so-called \"delayed transfer of care\").\n\nThis is well above the preferred rate of bed use. A large number of studies of hospital management have demonstrated how, when there are few spare hospital beds, even very modest further reductions in the number of free beds can dramatically increase the likelihood of any given patient being caught in a hospital backlog, which can lead to significant delays in care.\n\nThat high utilisation rate is why, in addition to the elevated rate of trolley waits, there were 177 cancelled operations. That figure is much higher than the previous week, but is likely to be distorted because of the Bank Holiday. The rate at which operations was being cancelled also fell during the week.\n\nThe strain on the service will have been eased because of the expected fall in traffic over the second week of the year, with average daily A&E attendances dropping from 50,993 in the first week of the year to 47,195 in the second.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England added: \"We started planning for winter this year earlier than ever before and will continue to do everything we can to ensure the best care possible is being delivered.\"\n\nExperts are renewing calls to allow experiments on embryos beyond 14 days of development, saying it would drive medical breakthroughs.\n\nResearch on human embryos can only happen under a licence in the UK and it is currently illegal to keep them alive in laboratories for more than two weeks after fertilisation.\n\nUntil recently, this cut-off was almost irrelevant in terms of viability since science had not found a way to physically support life in the lab beyond about a week.\n\nBut researchers have found a way to chemically mimic the womb which would allow an early stage embryo to continue to develop for longer - at least 13 days after fertilisation, but potentially much more.\n\nOne of the pioneers of IVF is calling for a government inquiry.\n\nProf Simon Fishel was on the team involved with the birth of the world's first IVF baby. He believes that moving the limit to 28 days would be good for furthering scientific understanding.\n\nProf Fishel, who founded the CARE Fertility Group, said: \"I believe the benefits we will gain by eventually moving forwards when the case is proven will be of enormous importance to human health.\"\n\nObserving how the embryo changes over weeks could shed light on why some early miscarriages occur, he says.\n\nEmbryos normally implant in the wall of the uterus at around day seven and still resemble a ball of cells at that stage.\n\nIt takes weeks of rapid cell division and growth before it begins to resemble something more baby-like, with a beating heart, developing eyes and budding limbs.\n\nMagdalena Zernicka-Goetz has developed a technique that could, theoretically, allow embryos to survive for longer in the lab than the current legal limit of 14 days.\n\nThe Cambridge University professor says: \"We know that a lot of pregnancies fail on the time of implantation which is day seven. So now we can identify events which are not happening correctly and how in future we can help them occur normally.\"\n\nBut there are many who are concerned about extending the legal limit.\n\nProf Fishel said: \"There are some religious groups that will be fundamentally against IVF, let alone IVF research in any circumstances, and we have to respect their views.\"\n\nThe 14-day rule was first suggested in the UK in 1984. With the advent of IVF, a committee, chaired by Mary Warnock, was set up to look at the ethics and regulation of this new technology.\n\nIt concluded that the human embryo should be protected, but that research on embryos and IVF would be permissible, given appropriate safeguards.\n\nSetting a cut-off was tricky. For example, should it be based on when an embryo develops a nervous system that might begin to detect pain? At the time, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested 17 days as a limit - the point at which early neural development begins.\n\nThe Warnock report settled on 14 days - when the embryo is a distinct individual and can no longer form a twin.\n\nThat recommendation is now decades old. Some say it should be reviewed.\n\nDavid Jones, founder of the Centre of Bioethics and Emerging Technologies, is against changing the limit.\n\n\"It would be a stepping stone to the culturing of embryos and even foetuses outside the womb. You are really beyond the stage when the embryo would otherwise implant and that is a step towards to creating womb like environment outside. People will then ask why can't we shift it beyond 28 days?\"\n\nA recent YouGov poll of 1,740, commissioned by the BBC, found that 48% of the UK general public supported increasing the limit up to 28 days, 19% wanted to keep the present limit of 14 days and 10% wanted a total ban.\n\nBut one in four of those questioned said they did not know, suggesting some may need more information to reach an informed opinion.\n\nBBC Radio 4's two-part documentary 'Revisiting the 14 day rule' starts on Tuesday 17 January at 11:00 GMT.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Football\n\nThe Football Association is looking at introducing retrospective bans to English football for players who dive or feign injury.\n\nOfficials will go on a fact-finding trip to Scotland, where retrospective bans are already used.\n\nIn England, players are currently only given retrospective bans for incidents of violent conduct.\n\nIt is understood a rule change would require agreement from all football governing bodies in England.\n\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche believes diving would be eradicated from football \"in six months\" with retrospective bans.\n\nAccording to a report in Tuesday's Times newspaper, senior figures at the FA are keen to press ahead with the move.\n\nDyche's comments come after two recent incidents in Premier League matches.\n\nRobert Snodgrass apologised for going down without contact to earn a penalty for Hull against Crystal Palace, while Dele Alli won a debated spot-kick in Tottenham's 5-0 win over Swansea.\n\nAt the start of the current season, Hearts' Jamie Walker was given a retrospective two-match ban for diving to win a penalty against Celtic in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nThe Scottish FA found him in breach of disciplinary rule 201 as the \"simulation caused a match official to make an incorrect decision\". The player contested the charge, but the compliance officer's verdict was upheld.\n\nUnder current Football Association rules in England, players who pretend to have been fouled should receive a caution for simulation, which comes under the category of unsporting behaviour, if the incident is spotted by the match officials.\n\nHowever, this can only occur during matches at the moment.\n\nThe question of how to deal with players who dive or cheat has long troubled English football.\n\nThe law which allows retrospective punishment in Scotland is being examined closely by FA chiefs.\n\nBut any changes in England would require agreement from the game's various stakeholders. That means the Professional Footballers' Association, League Managers Association, English Football League and Premier League would all need to reach a consensus.\n\nConcerns over player", "a number of players now who have started individual leadership plans,\" Jones added. \"We will see those players develop over the next period of time.\"\n\nHaving skippered England to an unbeaten year in 2016, hooker Dylan Hartley will again captain the side in the Six Nations - fitness-permitting - with Jones highlighting playmaker Owen Farrell as a likely replacement should he be unavailable.\n\n\"Owen makes sure the standards are kept high, as does [fly-half] George Ford,\" Jones said. \"Certainly if Dylan wasn't ready Owen could be a very strong candidate.\"\n\nWith many hospitals close to full in these difficult winter weeks, there has been much debate about the resources available in the health service.\n\nPatient demand is rising faster than the budget increases allocated to the NHS in England.\n\nYet the number of hospital bed numbers has fallen steadily in recent years. So what is going on?\n\nThe total number of overnight hospital beds in England fell from 144,455 at the start of the 2010/11 financial year to 129,458 in the middle of 2016 (the last recorded figures). The number of day beds over that period increased from 11,783 to 12,480.\n\nLooking further back into history reveals a sharper rate of decline.\n\nThat current figure of overnight beds compares with almost 300,000 in 1987-88 according to figures from the Nuffield Trust.\n\nThere was a steep fall in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then a more static position between 2000 and 2005 and then a resumption of the downward curve.\n\nThe fall in bed numbers coincided with big changes in patterns of care.\n\nInstitutionalised mental health treatment gave way to more care in a patient's local community so fewer beds were needed.\n\nElderly care medicine changed too, with more older patients cared for closer to home.\n\nMedical advances meant that more patients could be treated as day cases.\n\nAverage stays in hospitals for those needing overnight beds have fallen. There was a similar trend in other healthcare systems.\n\nAs bed numbers fell in England, occupancy rates did not shoot up. This suggests that the health service has been more efficient with its care and dealing with more cases outside hospitals.\n\nOver the first three months of 2016 in England, 89% of beds were occupied on average compared to 86.6% over the same period in 2011.\n\nBut has the system reached a tipping point? Hospital bed occupancy rates have crept up to 95% in the first weeks of 2017.\n\nTrust chiefs have reported days when they have been literally full with a new patient admitted only when one has been discharged.\n\nBack in October 2014, a Nuffield Trust report noted that pressures were immense with demographic change and an ageing population the most significant drivers.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that if admission rates continue to rise, the NHS will need an additional 6.2m 'bed days' by 2022 - which equates to 22 hospitals with 800 beds each,\" it said.\n\nNuffield went on to say that building new hospitals was not the answer and that curbing demand had to be part of the solution along with more joined up health and social care to keep people out of hospital where possible.\n\nThat was their prognosis in 2014. Two-and-a-half years on there have been no obvious signs of progress.\n\nThe drive for efficiency savings will continue but the calls for more investment in the NHS have become louder.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Hospitals in England, Sir Mike Richards, told the BBC this week that he was \"very concerned\" about the degree of strain experienced by hospitals.\n\nHe continued by saying \"I believe the government will need to put more money into the NHS\" - though he added it was important the money was spent \"wisely\".\n\nThe budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) argued this week that it was inevitable that health spending would rise because of demographic factors and the advance of medical technology.\n\nThe OBR said health spending could rise from 6.9% of economic activity (GDP) in 2021 to 12.6% in 2066.\n\nThe watchdog noted this could put great strain on public finances unless governments raised taxes or cut spending elsewhere.\n\nMinisters argue they have given the NHS in England above inflation increases in funding through till 2020.\n\nThey also say that progress is being made at local level in joining up health and social care.\n\nBut the demands for more money will continue, including from some on the Conservative benches in the Commons.\n\nAnd questions will be asked about the wisdom of reducing bed numbers and whether that can be reversed.\n\nHave you used NHS services in 2017?

And the collected data can be used by cafe owners to prepare a personal mix for returning customers.\n\nWith more than 500 million people across the region enjoying a daily hookah pipe, this is one of several innovations that the Beirut start-up ecosystem is beginning to create.\n\nNara is the brainchild of Lebanese-born Fady Isshak, Joe Zoghzoghy, and Mark Haidar - the latter now a highly successful US-based entrepreneur.\n\nBut Mr Haidar's start in life was far less auspicious.\n\nRaised in a \"mixed\" South Lebanese refugee area of Bedouins, Palestinians and other displaced peoples, Mr Haidar created his first product, a smart chair, when he was 17 and without the use of electricity.\n\nMark Haidar made his money in the US but is now investing in his home country, Lebanon\n\nSmart and ambitious, he left Beirut when he was 23. Four days later he had received his US visa, after charming the interviewer by saying he'd learned English by watching the \"two best documentaries on America\": The Simpsons and Seinfeld.\n\nThe reason for his swift departure was the beginning of the 2006 war.\n\nHis father ordered him to get out of Beirut and gave his son the family's life savings of $2,200 (\u00a31,785), asking only for him to leave \"$300 for food\".\n\nMr Haidar took his chance, managed to get to the border, and like many refugees after him, travelled through Syria, Turkey and Germany before finally flying to the US and getting a job in a Detroit petrol station.\n\nThe rest was another example of the American Dream come true. His companies include Silvr, a payments company, and Dialexa, a technology and product development firm.\n\nWhile Mr Haidar has invested in a Beirut start-up", "10ft (3m), but if you come closer he will trot off.\"\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nManchester United goalkeeper David de Gea produced a Wembley masterclass as interim manager Ole Gunnaer Solskjaer made it six wins out of six to damage Tottenham's Premier League title ambitions.\n\nMarcus Rashford's low finish from Paul Pogba's superb pass on the stroke of half-time stretched Solskjaer's flawless start - but the Norwegian had De Gea to thank for a magnificent display as Spurs laid siege to United's goal after the break.\n\nThe Spaniard made a succession of crucial interventions, 11 in total, including many with his feet, as Spurs tried in vain to avoid a defeat that makes their task of keeping pace with Liverpool and Manchester City even more arduous.\n\nUnited showed great resilience to back up their early positive approach but it was De Gea who broke Spurs' hearts by denying Harry Kane on several occasions, as well as Dele Alli and Toby Alderweireld.\n\nThe result leaves Spurs nine points behind leaders Liverpool and United level on points with fifth-placed Arsenal as they revive their top-four hopes.\n\nFew would have placed Solskjaer as a serious contender on any list to replace Jose Mourinho when he was sacked as United boss in December.\n\nAnd while he may not be the front-runner yet, he has done everything asked of him and this victory against a team in title contention - and with a manager in Mauricio Pochettino who many regard as favourite to be next in the chair at Old Trafford - was the biggest statement of his credentials yet.\n\nMake no mistake, Solskjaer relied hugely on De Gea's brilliance as he formed a one-man barrier to defy Spurs to secure this win, but he also arrived with a positive mindset and team selection that put United right in the game and led to them getting that half-time lead through Rashford's goal on the counter-attack.\n\nThis was his sternest test after a relatively friendly introductory fixture list and, with the help of De Gea, he was able to complete it successfully.\n\nSolskjaer has given a disaffected squad unity of purpose once more, with Pogba seemingly instantly rejuvenated by Mourinho's departure, and this run of wins has rebuilt fractured confidence and belief.\n\nThe odds on may yet be against Solskjaer claiming the job permanently as other names, such as England manager Gareth Southgate and Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone, are mentioned, but if he is undertaking an audition, wins like this do his chances no harm.\n\nDe Gea gave a brilliant demonstration of goalkeeping - showing that feet can be utilised as successfully as hands when the occasion demands - but there was also real cause for frustration for Spurs.\n\nPochettino's side created chance after chance after half-time only to be thwarted by De Gea, captain Kane his victim on several occasions.\n\nNo-one could question Spurs' heart or application but they may feel they could - and should - have done better with many of their opportunities, often giving De Gea the chance to make the saves when more accurate finishing would have left him with no hope.\n\nThis result is a bitter blow to Spurs as they try to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City and the sight of Kane limping heavily and accompanied by a physio after the final whistle is an added worry for Pochettino.\n\nSpurs have had damaging home defeats to Wolves and now United in recent weeks - they cannot afford many more if they are to maintain a meaningful title pursuit.\n\n'Man Utd expect to win every game' - what they said\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am so pleased and I'm proud.

But here we will focus on the situation of Britons living in another EU country (in the EU27).\n\nAbout 1.3m UK-born people are resident in the EU27, while the UK hosts about 3.2m EU27 nationals.\n\nThe withdrawal deal would enable them to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights, until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period ends.\n\nAs for no deal, there is huge uncertainty about what it will mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.\n\nThe priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.\n\nThe European Commission, in its contingency plan for no-deal Brexit, urges the EU27 to \"take a generous approach to the rights of UK citizens in the EU, provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK\".\n\nIt says the EU27 \"should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status\".\n\nThere is uncertainty over how a no deal would affect flights in Europe\n\nThe Commission - the EU executive - has proposed visa-free travel for British visitors to the EU, provided the UK reciprocates.\n\nUnder the political declaration agreed alongside the withdrawal deal the UK says \"the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply\" after the transition.\n\nIt speaks of \"non-discrimination\" and \"full reciprocity\" and says both sides \"aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits\".\n\nHowever, that declaration is not legally binding; it spells out ambitions for the future UK-EU relationship, yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder no deal, the declaration would be null and void. The UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a \"third country\" like other non-EU states.\n\nSo the rules for Britons in the EU could well be the same as for Americans or Chinese - it will depend on the rules of the individual member states.\n\nSome of them have announced interim measures to protect UK citizens in the case of a no-deal Brexit, but they are generally only temporary, for example, Spain will offer transitional measures for 21 months after Brexit, Germany offers protection for nine months and France will put them in place for one year.\n\nBritish workers are integral to Airbus airliner production in Europe\n\nNo deal would immediately hit Britons whose work currently takes them to more than one EU country.\n\nThey would no longer be on a level playing field vis-a-vis EU citizens, who can easily move to another EU country and start a new job there. For Britons, post-Brexit, there will be more bureaucracy.\n\nMobility in Europe is important for many private sector workers, especially in the tech sector, such as computer game designers.\n\nSpecialists involved in pan-European research projects also need to be able to travel easily across the EU, often at short notice.\n\nDaniel Tetlow of campaign group British in Germany says \"Brits are now being discriminated against in job applications\".\n\nPost-Brexit, he said: \"I have the right only to continue working in Germany - I'm effectively landlocked.\n\n\"This has huge career implications for all UK citizens, not just those living in the EU, as is often misunderstood,\" he told the BBC. British in Germany is part of the coalition British in Europe.\n\nIt is not clear which UK professional qualifications will be recognised in the EU post-Brexit, and vice versa. Those details are yet to be negotiated.\n\nUnder the withdrawal deal, British students in the EU27 can continue under the current system. But from 2021 they may face much higher tuition fees - those that non-EU students have to pay. Only Germany and Norway (which applies EU rules) offer free tuition for international students.\n\nJob search in Berlin: Conditions will change for British jobseekers\n\nNo deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply.\n\nIt could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU.\n\nNo deal would most likely delay the registration of some medicines and/or delivery of them.\n\nBritons could find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that post-Brexit, if a UK national moves to the EU, access to benefits will depend on the host country's immigration policy and the terms of any bilateral social security agreement it has with the UK.\n\nIn the EU, social security contributions are co-ordinated. So someone who has worked in more than one member state can make just one application to the relevant agency where they are living when they reach pension age. That agency notifies any other EU state where the individual has worked, and the national insurance contribution that he/she paid there becomes part of the pension.\n\nThat reciprocity disappears under a no-deal scenario. It is not clear whether any old bilateral UK deals with individual EU states on social security will be revived.\n\nThe UK tax treatment of overseas pension transfers could change post-Brexit. Transfers from the UK to non-EU countries have been subject to a 25% UK \"overseas tax charge\" since 2017. There is no guarantee that tax-free transfers will continue for UK pensioners living in the EU.\n\nWhat about the EU27 countries where most UK citizens live?\n\nOf the estimated 310,000 Britons living in Spain, about 65,000 are resident and in permanent work. About one-third of the 310,000 are pensioners.\n\nNo deal would be much less of a problem for a Briton with dual nationality. But Spain does not allow it - except for veterans of the 1930s left-wing International Brigades and Sephardi Jews who can prove a family connection with Spain. For other Britons, acquiring Spanish citizenship means surrendering a UK passport.\n\n\"Third country\" nationals in Spain have to prove annual income of at least \u20ac26,000 (\u00a323,000; $30,000) to remain legally resident - and that could be a problem for some British pensioners, post-Brexit.\n\nSpain is offering a 21-month grace period of protection for UK nationals, after which proof of residence will be needed.\n\nWhatever happens, both governments say, the Common Travel Area (CTA) will remain in force. That is a relief for Britons living in Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder the CTA, Irish and British citizens can travel and work freely in both countries. It is also recognised by the EU.\n\nThe big risk is that no deal could bring back a \"hard\" Northern Ireland border - something the withdrawal deal goes to great lengths to prevent, with the controversial backstop plan.\n\nFrench MPs have granted the government emergency powers to issue decrees in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe government says it will not impose visas on British visitors, provided the UK government also maintains visa-free travel.", "tweeted her support for Ms Winfrey.\n\nCritics said Ms Trump's support for the president was incompatible with her endorsement of Ms Winfrey's Time's Up campaign.\n\nMr Trump has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault, all of which he has denied.\n\nIvanka Trump, who describes herself as an adviser to the president on \"job creation, economic empowerment, workforce development & entrepreneurship\", has made women's issues one of her key policy areas since joining the White House.\n\nIn November, she told a Tokyo summit that sexual harassment of women should \"never be tolerated\".\n\nLike Oprah Winfrey, Ms Trump has been subject of rumours about her potential presidential ambitions.\n\nA book about the Trump administration - Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House - alleges Ms Trump and her husband Jared Kushner struck a deal that she might run for president in the future.\n\nShe's a staffer in a conservative White House who sometimes embraces more moderate policies. She's married to a man with an administrative portfolio of remarkable breadth. She embraces feminist principles but works for a president who once boasted of making unwanted sexual advances.\n\nIvanka Trump has to walk a fine line in everything she does, as the national spotlight falls squarely on her for the foregoing reasons and more.\n\nNeedless to say, her tweet about an Oprah Winfrey speech - viewed not just as an emphatic condemnation of a sexual harassment culture and a presidential trial balloon, but also as a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr Trump's presidency - turned heads.\n\nMs Trump gave a well-received address at the Republican National Convention that sounded moderate - even a bit Democratic - but her agenda has fallen flat since inauguration. Recommendations on climate change and immigration have been disregarded, and her childcare proposal has languished.\n\nMaybe that's why, if Fire and Fury's Michael Wolff is correct, Ms Trump harbours her own presidential ambitions. While she roams the halls of power now, she has left no mark on the nation. When she does draw attention, it's for the wrong reasons.\n\nJo Whiley is to co-present a new, extended drivetime show with Simon Mayo, as Radio 2 overhauls its schedule.\n\nWhiley will be the first female DJ on the station's weekday daytime schedule for 20 years.\n\nDebbie Thrower was the last, presenting Radio 2's afternoon show between 1995 and 1998.\n\nAt a time when pay equality is under scrutiny at the BBC, Radio 2 confirmed Mayo and Whiley will earn the same.\n\nIn other changes to the station's line-up, Sara Cox will present a new show from 22:00 to midnight every Monday to Thursday.\n\nGary Davies replaces Cox on the popular Sound of the 80s programme while 6 Music's Cerys Matthews takes over the Blues Show from Paul Jones, who leaves the station after more than 30 years.\n\nThe Arts Show will be ending, as will The Organist Entertains - which has been on the network for almost 50 years.\n\nNigel Ogden (right) has presented The Organist Entertains for 38 years\n\nPresenter Nigel Ogden thanked listeners for supporting the show over the last five decades.\n\n\"I've loved hearing from them and send them my very best wishes for the future. I'd also like to thank Radio 2 for giving me the opportunity to play the music I love each week. It has been a huge privilege.\"\n\nListen to the Band is also being taken off the air. Radio 2 says brass band music will continue to be played elsewhere.\n\nThe changes, which come into effect from 14 May, also see Robot Wars presenter Angela Scanlon added to the Sunday morning schedule, and OJ Borg presenting a live overnight show on weekdays.\n\nWhiley, who joined Radio 2 in 2011, currently hosts a weeknight show specialising in new music.\n\nShe started her career as a researcher on Channel 4's The Word and hosted Radio 1's Evening Session with Steve Lamacq at the height of Britpop.\n\nThe new drivetime show is the first time she has shared the microphone with Mayo.\n\nAs Simon Mayo knows, presenting at drivetime often means eating dinner during the songs\n\n\"Although we've known each other for over 20 years, we've never presented a show together,\" said Mayo in a statement. \"And given that Jo is quite brilliant, it's high time we put that right.\"\n\n\"What a thrill to be working with Simon on this exciting new show,\" added Whiley.\n\n\"It's going to be great fun and listeners can look forward to some incredible music and chat, as well as being introduced to some fantastic new talent along the way. Cannot wait! \"\n\nTheir pairing results in an extra hour of radio, with the drivetime slot extended from 17:00 to 20:00 every weekday, except Friday - when Tony Blackburn's Golden Hour remains from 19:00 to 20:00.\n\nAs a result, the weekly Blues, Jazz, Folk and Country shows will move one hour later - starting at 20:00 from Monday to Thursday.\n\nAccording to figures published by the BBC last July, Mayo currently receives a salary in the range \u00a3350,000 - \u00a3399,999, while Whiley is paid \u00a3150,000 - \u00a3199,999.\n\nAlthough they will receive equal pay for their upcoming show, there will still be a disparity in their total salaries, as Mayo presents a weekly show for 5 Live, and Whiley hosts events including Glastonbury for BBC television.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It affects countries that account for about two thirds of global economic activity.\n\nThe fact that in the bank's view the economy is close to operating at full capacity means that there's little scope to stimulate further growth with the standard policy tools that work by boosting demand for goods and services - interest rate or tax cuts or increased government spending.\n\nIt says government should promote reforms to improve education and health services and infrastructure - such as roads ports, electricity supplies and telecommunications networks.\n\nA healthier and better educated workforce is likely to be more productive, and better infrastructure makes it easier for business to be more productive too.\n\nThe weaker growth of the capacity of the economy is an increasingly persistent theme in the analysis of official economic agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\n\nThere are some marked variations in", "march.\n\nMore people turned out to witness Mr Trump and his entourage travelling along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House on Friday afternoon.\n\nThree people, including a young child, have died after a car deliberately hit pedestrians in central Melbourne, police say.\n\nAt least 29 people were injured, among them a baby who is in a critical condition after the car hit a pram.\n\nPolice have arrested the driver but say the incident was not terror-related.\n\nFootage filmed by a bystander showed a maroon car driving in circles in front of nearby Flinders Street railway station.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Football\n\nSirli Freitas took one, final phone call from her husband Cleberson Silva before he had to switch off his phone.\n\n\"There was so much background noise,\" she said. \"So much laughter and fun.\n\n\"I said, 'are you really on a plane, or in a bar?'\"\n\nJournalist Silva was on a plane that went down in the Andes on 29 November. He was one of 71 people who died along with almost the entire Chapecoense football team.\n\nThe players were en route to the biggest match in the club's 43-year history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Colombia's Atletico Nacional.\n\nOn Saturday, Chapecoense will play their first match since the crash - a friendly against defending Brazilian league champions Palmeiras.\n\nThe people of Chapeco will, once-again, fill the small Arena Conda to see some of the 22 new players who make up the squad.\n\nThree of the six survivors were players, including central defender Neto, who was one of the team's leaders.\n\nHe lay for six hours, trapped beneath the fuselage and trees, before being the last to be pulled out.\n\n\"I remember the lights went out suddenly, then I started praying, asking God to help us,\" he said. \"But a lot of people thought the plane was just landing, because it was not an abrupt fall.\n\n\"I remember the moment that I couldn't hear the plane engine anymore. It was just the wind, and then an alarm.\n\n\"But no-one got desperate, there was a lot of people praying. These are the last memories I have.\"\n\nWhen Neto woke up in hospital, he was told he had been injured in the match because nobody knew quite how to break the news to him.\n\nBut the truth dawned on him when there were no video clips of the match or evidence of his injury.\n\nChapeco is a quiet, unassuming city with an air of settled contentment. Its population of about 209,553 is only slightly higher than the number of people who crammed into the Maracana Stadium to watch the 1950 World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil.\n\nBut they form a tight-knit community, and a major part of that is the Chapecoense football team.\n\nClub flags and signs adorn shops and bars all over the city.\n\nThe relationship between citizens and club is one of mutual and humble respect and affection, according to 41-year-old Karina Dini.\n\n\"It was a strong bond, we were all a family,\" she said, sitting in the office of the language school she runs with her husband.\n\n\"There weren't any players who were going to parties or anything. Most of them were very committed. We could meet them in restaurants or the supermarket.\n\n\"It was amazing because players from the first division don't get that contact with people. They have big cars, they can't talk to people.\"\n\nLike Karina, whose husband's uncle died in the crash, most people here know someone who was on the plane, or someone, like Sirli Freitas, who's been affected directly.\n\n\"My eight-year-old son understands [what happened], but his sister, who's three, still asks for her dad even though she knows he's not here any more,\" she said, through tears.\n\n\"If you ask her about him, she says that he was on the plane that crashed, but but at other times she'll say, 'let's call daddy'.\"\n\nOutside the Arena Conda, there's a message to the world: \"We were looking for a word to say thanks for all the love we've received, and we found several.\"\n\nAround the stadium, the streets have been painted green and white, in the club's colours.\n\nThere has been a steady procession of press conferences, introducing some of the 22 new players. Rui Costa was brought in from Brazilian club Gremio and made director of football a week after the tragedy.\n\nCosta is adamant that Saturday's match is far more than a friendly.\n\n\"When I got here we had four players and a devastated dressing room. It was all about sadness and silence,\" he said.\n\n\"A dressing room should never be silent and here, it was. So we have accomplished our first goal - you can see a football team training here.\"\n\n\"We had a list with 90 names that we were interested in,\" he said, as he explained how he assembled the squad in less than two months.\n\n\"We were choosing based on technical characteristics, then behaviour, then salary.\n\n\"We were working almost 24 hours a day because we knew it was not about just putting them on the pitch to play together.\n\n\"We had to respect the culture of the club. That's what they hired me for.\"\n\nThe last time the people of Chapeco went to the Arena Conda, it was on a day of torrential rain, to receive the bodies of their players, directors and journalists.\n\nOn Saturday, they will return, to honour the city's fallen, and to meet their new family.\n\nThe 2004 Beslan school siege is remembered for the deaths of more than 330 people including 186 children, after a Russian school was seized by Chechen rebels. But the Belgian creators of a play, Us/Them, which relives the atrocity through the eyes of two children, say recent attacks have brought the story closer to home.\n\nThe actress Gytha Parmentier has now played Us/Them in three languages.\n\nWhen the play opened in 2014 she was speaking in her native Flemish. Later she had to translate into French the words of her character - a young girl who dies in the Beslan siege.\n\nNow she's making the one-hour piece work in English opposite Roman Van Houtven, the only other member of cast.\n\nLast year the play was a hit at the Edinburgh Festival and it has now arrived at London's National Theatre.\n\n\"Acting in English, Roman and I had to learn to move our mouths in a very different way,\" she said. \"But acting in a different language gives a new juiciness to what's in the script.\"\n\nThat script is by Carly Wijs, who also directs. She recalls the spark for the play came when her eight year-old son mentioned news coverage he'd just seen of the terror attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013.\n\n\"Godfried had been watching the report on the children's news and I was struck by the way he described it. He spoke in a way which was almost aloof - at eight you're just becoming aware of things which are on your planet but not really of your own world of home and family.\n\n\"Then Bronks, which is a fantastic production company in Brussels, asked me for a theatre idea for children. So I thought I would break a taboo by writing about Beslan while borrowing Godfried's tone and his very objective manner.\"\n\nIn Belgium Wij/Zij has been listed as suitable for children of nine and above; in London the National Theatre pitches Us/Them for young people aged 12 and over.\n\nThe highly physical production is made for touring and the Dorfman stage at the National is almost bare apart from balloons and string.\n\nThe production avoids the off-putting cuteness which can trip up adult actors impersonating young children. The result is heart-breaking yet somehow heart-warming too.\n\nThe show may not strike theatregoers in advance as an obvious excursion for kids. But it's an unexpectedly charming hour in the theatre perfect for family viewing. However, the National has mainly programmed performances late in the evening which may be a bad call.\n\nWijs says her view of the events of 2004 was influenced by one TV documentary in particular.\n\n\"There was a beautiful BBC programme called Children of Beslan which was helpful: they spoke to many survivors. But our play isn't a documentary. It has to work for children who know nothing of Beslan and also for their", "on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked.

Then a Facebook message changed everything.\n\nIt was on the second day of our five-day trek that I realised it was missing.\n\nWe had packed up the tents and loaded the horses. I reached up to the horse's mane to pull myself up and saw that my wrist was bare.\n\n\"My mum's bracelet! It's gone,\" I thought, and immediately burst into tears.\n\nMade from melted-down rings she inherited from her own mother, the bracelet had always been worn by my mum for almost as long as I could remember.\n\nEloise Dicker's wrist with and without the bracelet\n\nHer wrist was very slender even towards the end of her life, with steroids puffing her up like a blowfish. There came a point, however, when she couldn't wear it any more.\n\nShe had taken it off and placed it on her bedside table. While clearing up the cups and tissues, tablets and tinctures, I had picked the bracelet up and put it on.\n\nShe'd smiled, put her hand on my wrist and said how lovely it was to see me wearing it and that one day I would pass it on to my children.\n\nShe died a couple of months later, and I had never taken the bracelet off.\n\nRosemary Dicker, wearing the bracelet six months before her death on Mother's Day 2015\n\nNow I felt pain in my throat and a sinking feeling in my stomach. It could be anywhere in this vast landscape - the Tian Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia.\n\nThere was a silence as we all realised there was no point in even trying to find it. We were two days up into the mountains and surrounded by grass.\n\nI had one last look around our camp. It was no use. I couldn't re-trace my steps, we were in the middle of nowhere. I climbed back on the horse.\n\nI walked behind the others, crying and thinking. All the memories of her passing away came back to me, bit by bit.\n\nMy naked wrist still made me feel incomplete. I wanted to go back in time to the moment I decided to bring it with me. Why hadn't I left it at home?\n\nBut maybe it was meant to be here, I thought to myself. Mum was born in Hong Kong and grew up in the UK, and this was half way.\n\nAn endless lush landscape with wild horses, snowy peaks, birds of prey and the sound of the river. Maybe it should be lost here.\n\nThat night I looked in the tents with a bit of hope left that it might be in some corner. Nothing.\n\nI crawled into my sleeping bag feeling deeply sad, and accepted it was gone for good.\n\nLater, in the city of Karakol, recovering from our trek, I visited the Russian Orthodox church.\n\nI was just about to leave, having lit a candle in remembrance of my mother, when the Russian nun took my arm and walked me to a painting of the Virgin Mary.\n\nShe kissed the glass frame of the picture and gestured that I do the same. I'm not a believer, and was not brought up religious in any way, but I followed her invitation.\n\nWhen I kissed the glass I looked up at the picture. I started crying. The picture was adorned with gold necklaces and rings.\n\nIt was feeling just how jewellery was so significant to humans that made me cry. As a student of anthropology, I have always been interested in the meaning we humans ascribe to objects.\n\nJewellery by its very nature says: Look at me, see what I can afford, observe what I was given, admire how significant I am.\n\nWhen inherited from a beloved, it also brings people into relationship, solidifying a kinship or affection, creating a sense of connectedness and of presence.\n\nThat bracelet was a physical part of my mother who is no longer physically in the world. It became part of me, and now was gone.\n\nI had already made peace with the loss of the bracelet when, some weeks after I had returned to Europe, I received a Facebook message from Elaman Asanbaev, one of the guides from the Community-Based Tourism (CBT) office in Karakol.\n\nThere was a picture attached. \"This is it or not, I don't know,\" he asked.\n\nIt was it. It was the bracelet.\n\nIt was suddenly back in existence, but what should I do? Should I get Elaman to send it? Should I leave it there? Ask him to throw it in the river?\n\nWhen I looked into secure courier services, they advised against sending precious stones or metals. I was also reluctant to trust the postal system, it being so far away.\n\nIt did occur to me that I could find someone who would be travelling there, but when I saw that flights were cheap in November I decided I would go and get it myself.\n\nLondon-Moscow-Bishkek. Then a six-hour drive from the capital Bishkek to Karakol with Azamat Asanov, the CBT manager. It was 05:00 and -11C in the capital, the roads icy with thick snow.\n\nAs we drove, I watched the country waking up. Children in their winter clothes walking to school, horses with snow on their backs, men in the traditional pointed Kyrgyz hats known as kalpaks.\n\nThe next morning we picked up Elaman. \"This is for you,\" he said as he jumped in the car.\n\nThere it was. This slim piece of gold that I have known all my life.\n\nThis part of mum, here in this car 7,000km (4,350 miles) from home in the freezing mountains of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nElaman described to Azamat where he found it. I didn't understand anything except a word that sounded like \"toilet\".\n\nAzamat translated - it was in our first campsite, a yurt camp, lying on a path towards the toilets (or, more accurately, a shed with a hole in the ground).\n\nWe laughed. Not the most romantic of places.\n\nI felt its weight and its shape. Mum held this. Putting it back on I felt complete again, and I couldn't stop looking at it.\n\nI gave Elaman a designer flask and wrapped some money around it as a reward for handing in the bracelet.\n\nThere was another day in the snow on horseback before I turned round and made the long 21-hour journey back home.\n\nWe took the horses up the Bos Uchuk valley, which means \"colourful point\". This was where we had camped on our last day of the summer trek. I could recognise the shape of the mountains and the river.\n\nOn my way back to the town I sprinkled some of mum's ashes in the river - something to exchange for the bracelet in the ground, something to put her between home and where she was born, Hong Kong.\n\nAt this point I felt that these rituals were almost too much.\n\nYet back home, looking at photographs of mum, I notice the bracelet in every picture. I think how strange it is to know that it had a story waiting of being lost and found far away in a wonderful place.\n\nIs this still the most precious thing that I own? Yes.

The price of the weekday edition and the Observer are also going up by 20p, to \u00a32.20 and \u00a33.20 respectively.\n\nRania Youssef is set to appear in court after being accused of \"inciting debauchery\".\n\nThe Egyptian actress appeared at the Cairo Film Festival in a lacy, black, see-through outfit that exposed most of her legs.\n\nA complaint against her was filed by two lawyers, Amr Abdelsalam and Samir Sabry, known for taking celebrities to court.\n\nMinisters are being warned that a proposal to scrap prison sentences of six months or less will only work if there is more investment in the probation services.\n\nThe government says this approach in England and Wales' prisons could reduce overcrowding and re-offending.\n\nIt is thought it would free up thousands of prison places.\n\nBut the probation officers' union says the partial privatisation of the service needs to be reversed.\n\nAbout 30,000 offenders - including burglars and most shoplifters - could avoid jail every year under the Ministry of Justice plans.\n\nSentences for violent and sexual crimes would not be affected by the proposed change, which has been welcomed by prison reform charities as well as trade union Napo.\n\nIan Lawrence, Napo's general secretary, said while he supported the concept, there was \"one important caveat\".\n\nHe told the BBC the part-privatisation over the past four years had \"had a massive impact on service delivery and the ability of our skilled professionals to do exactly what they should be doing\".\n\n\"Levels of supervision, in many regards, are unsatisfactory,\" he said. \"It's not conducive to proper rehabilitation. It's not cost-effective for the taxpayer.\n\n\"And what we need to see is more provision in the community for people to be given the opportunity to turn their lives around.\"\n\nMr Stewart has previously spoken of his ambition to reduce short prison terms\n\nOffenders could face sanctions such as community sentences if the proposal goes ahead, but no alternative penalties have been confirmed.\n\nMinisters argue that short jail terms are less effective at cutting reoffending than community penalties.\n\nPrisons minister Rory Stewart told the Daily Telegraph that such sentences were \"long enough to damage you and not long enough to heal you\".\n\nArguing for the need for reform, Mr Stewart said: \"You bring somebody in for three or four weeks, they lose their house, their job, their family, their reputation.\n\n\"They come (into prison), they meet a lot of interesting characters (to put it politely) and then you whap them on to the streets again.\n\n\"The public are safer if we have a good community sentence... and it will relieve a lot of pressure on prisons.\"\n\nFrances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told the BBC: \"We should not be using prison for these people. We should be turning their lives around and giving them support - dealing with their drug addiction, their homelessness - and getting them to make amends for the wrong they have done.\n\n\"That's really good for victims, it's good for the taxpayer and it will ease pressure on prisons.\"\n\nThe Prison Reform Trust, which has previously called for a presumption against short prison sentences, welcomed the new proposals.\n\nPeter Dawson, the charity's director, told the Telegraph: \"Ministers should be congratulated for having the political courage to start the debate.\"\n\nIn Scotland, a presumption against prison sentences of less than three months is already in place and is due to be extended to 12 months.\n\nMore than half of the 86,275 offenders sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales in 2017 were handed sentences of six months or less, according to a Parliamentary response from Mr Stewart last month.\n\nThe prison population has doubled in England and Wales since the early 1990s, rising from about 40,000 to more than 80,000 in 2018, official figures show.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of prisoners released after sentences of less than 12 months reoffend within a year.\n\nWhat impact do short prison sentences have?

At the end of a hard match, I just tried to enjoy the moment.\n\n\"It's my first match on this court and it was very special.\"\n\nAndy Murray, Greg Rusedski, John Lloyd, Roger Taylor and Tim Henman - who was watching from the front row on Rod Laver Arena - are the only other British men to have reached Grand Slam singles semi-finals since tennis turned professional in 1968.\n\nEdmund has long looked the most likely to join that list, but few would have predicted it would happen at this year's Australian Open.\n\nRanked 49th and without an ATP final to his name, let alone a title, logic suggested there were several more steps to make before becoming a major contender.\n\nHowever, the 23-year-old Yorkshireman's huge forehand is already one of the biggest shots in the game, and marked improvements on serve and return in the off-season appear to have fast-tracked him.\n\n\"It's great,\" added Edmund. \"You don't think of those things when you play but it's something to be proud of.\n\n\"As a kid you're growing up looking at your idols and when you're here progressing in the best tournament in the world, it's amazing.\"\n\n'I prayed that last ball was out'\n\nDimitrov, 26, had won a much-anticipated match against Nick Kyrgios to reach the last eight, but his form had been patchy before then and he failed to impose himself on the powerful Edmund.\n\nThe Bulgarian dropped serve in the opening game with a loose backhand and, despite levelling at 3-3, it was a fair reflection of the play when Edmund hammered a forehand return to break again at 5-3.\n\nThe serve he had worked so hard on came to his rescue in seeing off three break-back points, and after 42 minutes the outsider was a set up.\n\nA scrappy second set slipped away from Edmund at the start as Dimitrov raced into a 3-0 lead and held on, despite an edgy seventh game that included three double faults.\n\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\n\nDimitrov's athleticism was on show with some brilliant defence early in the third set but the more experienced man was the one to crack.\n\nA loose forehand offered up two break points and a seventh double fault of the day gifted Edmund the chance to serve out the set.\n\nWhen Dimitrov hooked a wild forehand wide to drop serve midway through the fourth set there appeared no way back, but the tension took hold as Edmund handed it straight back with a poor service game.\n\nAgain there was an opening for the world number three to take charge, but once more it was Edmund who looked the calmer with victory in his sights.\n\nHe pressed for the break in game seven and then upped the pressure in game nine, opening with a hooked forehand winner followed by a backhand arrowed down the line.\n\nA first break point slipped way, but Edmund got his racquet on a good serve to float back a return on the second, and a desperate Dimitrov slammed his forehand into the net.\n\nWith Swedish coach Fredrik Rosengren a bundle of nerves in the stands, the Briton was thankful for a Dimitrov error at 15-30 and followed up with an ace.\n\nThere was one final moment of drama on match point when Edmund was made to wait - before Hawkeye eventually confirmed that Dimitrov had sent the ball long.\n\n\"He's played hard matches, especially against Nick Kyrgios, and I knew it was going to be tough,\" said Edmund.\n\n\"I had a bit of a dip and I was playing quite poor tennis at times. But I held my nerve and prayed that last ball was out.\"\n\nThat was Edmund's 12th attempt to beat a top five player, so he has shown perfect timing as well as the game to beat the world number three.\n\nFor a man making his Grand Slam quarter-final debut, on his first appearance in the Rod Laver Arena, Edmund played a hugely impressive first set. And even during the second set, which Dimitrov won, there were signs that all was not well with the Bulgarian's game.\n\nHis first serve virtually deserted him in the third set, and again, Edmund was there to take advantage.\n\nThe British player out-served Dimitrov, hit a healthy number of forehand winners, and profited handsomely when moving forward to the net.\n\nEdmund is yet to reach a final at tour level.

I've never had one person that's been there the whole way.\n\n\"It's all very mixed up. It feels really out of control and like I've not got one person - I've just been sent to loads of different places, I've been given bits and bobs, but it doesn't all fit.\n\n\"It would have been helpful if I could just have had someone from the start or had a therapist that sort of stayed with me, some continuous treatment that isn't literally just putting me in hospital and keeping me alive and then discharging me.\n\n\"I've never had anything that's sort of continuous, so how do I know what works?\"\n\nSienna says she felt while the symptoms of her anorexia were addressed, the underlining issues causing them were not.\n\nRachel says her other children have also suffered\n\n\"I just feel like I've never been properly treated for the mental side - they just sort of put me in hospital when my physical side's bad and they don't treat anything else, and then they wonder why it keeps happening, why I have to keep going back into hospital.\"\n\nFor her mother Rachel, the visits to various hospitals - on one occasion 300 miles away from home - have left her in need of therapy.\n\n\"It's the most horrible feeling when you have your daughter or your young person taken away from you.\n\n\"It feels like you've had your heart ripped out. You keep going and you keep going to do all you can to aid their recovery and you travel wherever you've got to travel.\n\n\"It's so tough leaving them somewhere where you don't know the staff and getting on a plane or in a car travelling all those miles back home. It's difficult for them and it's excruciating for the family really left behind.\"\n\nSarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity Young Minds, said while the government's green paper was very welcome, it was \"still only a", "has fought off at least one attempt by previous owners CVC Capital Partners to get rid of him.\n\nBut, whether he likes it or not, he will be an employee and therefore subject to the whims and wishes of his bosses - now Carey and Liberty owner John Malone.\n\nEcclestone has never really operated in such a situation before - by and large the previous owners, CVC, left him to his own devices. He likes to do things his way, and he is not one to enjoy outside interference.\n\nEcclestone's approach to business is adversarial. His problem is that Liberty have decided that they are going to run the business in a different way from now on - a more collegiate approach. He will either accept that and operate accordingly, or he won't be working there much longer.\n\nIt's hard to see how he could adapt to that way of working - or even want to. And senior sources in F1 say they believe that even if he does not go this week, they expect his departure to happen within a month.\n\nWhether he stays or not, changes will be made to the business structure. Liberty will employ two people to head up the different branches of the sport and oversee changes - commercial on the one hand; sporting and technical on the other.\n\nEx-ESPN marketing chief Sean Bratches has been given the commercial role, and former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn the other.\n\nThe history of F1 over the last decade or so has been the decline of the number of races in Europe, and the struggles of many of those remaining to meet Ecclestone's increasingly high demands for race fees.\n\nGermany does not have a race this year, and its contract ends after next year's grand prix in Hockenheim.\n\nItaly struck a new three-year deal at the 11th hour this winter. Silverstone is reluctantly toying with the idea of ending its contract after 2019 if it cannot renegotiate terms.\n\nThrough all this, Ecclestone has acted as if he does not care - if a race in Europe won't pay the fees he wants, he has usually said, he'll find one elsewhere.\n\nThere's usually a controversial regime wanting to stump up a wad of cash to host an F1 race.\n\nLiberty want to end this. They see the historic European races - Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, for example - as a key aspect of F1 and one they have to nurture and cherish.\n\nThey recognise that Europe is F1's core market, where most of its TV audience is, and they want the races there to be the centrepiece of the 'new F1', one that has a visible link to a heritage it treasures.\n\nEcclestone's ethos has been to take F1 to any country that wants it and has a large enough chequebook to fund it.\n\nHis eye has been on the deal itself - and not on its wider consequences on F1.\n\nThis is how F1 has ended up with races in Bahrain and Azerbaijan, countries with controversial records on human rights, and how Ecclestone has found himself for the last three years sitting next to Vladimir Putin at the Russian Grand Prix.\n\nAll three countries pay astronomical fees for their races - Russia $50m year; Azerbaijan a reputed $75m, for example.\n\nLiberty wants to take a different approach. For them, deals based solely on the bottom line and nothing else are not necessarily the right deals.\n\nThey want to expand F1 - but they want new races to be held in the right places and for the right reasons. And they are prepared to invest to make it happen.\n\nThis is a massive shift from Ecclestone's approach.\n\nThe idea of spending money now to earn more later has largely been anathema to Ecclestone.\n\nSome argue it has been one of the reasons why he struggled for so long to establish a race in the USA until Austin, Texas, came along.\n\nLiberty are open about wanting races in New York and Los Angeles - or near enough to be easily identified as such - and are prepared to put down their own money to make it happen.\n\nThey have also talked about more races in Latin America and Asia.\n\nCarey has been clear that he sees the opportunity to expand the business \"in all areas\", but the one where there is most room for improvement is in exploiting the internet.\n\nEcclestone has made no secret of the fact that he does not really get social media, nor see any opportunity to monetise it.\n\nYounger people in F1 have grown frustrated with this, and realise that there are any number of things that could be done.\n\nBut, aware that rare has been the person who has crossed Ecclestone without consequence, they have in recent years kept their counsel and waited for a change to happen.\n\nLiberty are clear that this is an area where they see vast potential, and it's quite conceivable that, over time, the entire business model of F1 will change as a result.\n\nRight now, F1 is sold as a whole package to one or sometimes two TV stations in a country. But insiders see the opportunity to sell it piecemeal through the internet, with varying degrees of access for varying amounts of money.\n\nPromotionally, too, there is a lot of room to make gains.\n\nEcclestone is called the \"promoter\". But many argue that's a misnomer - in that he doesn't really do any promoting at all.\n\nArrive in any city or country hosting a grand prix and it is often hard to tell there is an event going on.\n\nMany races are not sold out - but how are people who might have a passing interest in going expected to know when that opportunity exists without them being advertised effectively?\n\nLiberty are talking about having \"20 Super Bowls\". By which they don't mean an Americanisation of the event - but of making a bigger deal of the event itself wherever it is being held.\n\nBuild it up in the week before the race with various promotional activities and so on.\n\nMany F1 insiders recognise that in recent years the sport has lost its way a little.\n\nIt remains the arena where the best drivers in the world race in the fastest cars, but its edginess has been dulled.\n\nThe risk and challenge are still there - but less apparent.\n\nLiberty are keen to get this back.\n\nThis year's new rules - decided upon long before Liberty was involved - are a first step in that direction, with wider, more dramatic-looking cars expected to lap up to five seconds faster and provide a more extreme physical challenge for the drivers.\n\nBut the jury is still out as to whether this will work.\n\nNo-one doubts the cars will be dramatically faster. The question is whether Pirelli has managed to build the more durable tyres that have been demanded to go with them.\n\nF1 bosses have drawn up a set of requirements for Pirelli that they expect to lead to tyres on which drivers can push flat out most of the time - which has simply not been possible since 2011 because the tyres have been too fragile.\n\nIf this has not happened, it will turn out to have been rather pointless to make faster cars because the drivers will not be able to use all their potential.\n\nLiberty - having taken over the contract Ecclestone struck with Pirelli - have been made aware of these issues and will be watching closely.\n\nAnother area which may come under scrutiny is driver head protection.\n\nGoverning body the FIA has been working hard on the 'halo' device which protects drivers from heavy flying debris. It is planned for introduction in 2018.\n\nBut while the vast majority of drivers are in favour of it, the FIA has recently said its introduction depends on a philosophical discussion about aesthetics and the nature of F1.\n\nThe halo could yet be abandoned if it is considered contrary to the ethos of open-wheel, open-cockpit racing - although the drivers may fight against this.\n\nEverything is up for discussion - even the format of the race weekend itself. But Liberty wants to take an inclusive approach to any change, rather than the imposition Ecclestone has tended to pursue.\n\nIt is easy to see problems with some of Liberty's plans.\n\nFor one thing, they - like any other business - are in this to make money. And if they are going to make the European races more affordable for promoters and spend money establishing new ones in America, they are going to affect the bottom line, at least in the short term.\n\nBut they seem deadly serious about it.\n\nEqually, there are unlikely to be big changes immediately.\n\nAlthough Carey has been working hard for months, it will", "a meeting on immigration, 11 Jan 2018 Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" \n\n\n\nMr Trump tweeted that he had used \"tough\" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used \"racist\" language and that the president did call some African nations \"shitholes\".\n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.\n\n\n\nMr Trump's administration announced in November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.\n\n\n\nThousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek \"an alternative lawful immigration status\" or leave.\n\n\"President Trump assured the Nigerian president of US readiness to cut a new deal in helping Nigeria in terms of military weapons to combat terrorism\" - A statement from the Nigerian presidency after a phone call with President Trump, 13 Feb 2017 President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year. \n\n\n\nDuring the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.\n\n\n\nThe deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade. \n\n\n\nMeeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a \"very big trade deal\" that included \"helicopters and the like\".\n\n\"Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!

North Korea responded by vowing to launch a \"nuclear pre-emptive strike\" if it felt at risk. \n\n\n\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. \n\n\n\nIn January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting. \n\n\n\n\"Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\" Mr Trump tweeted in March. \n\n\n\nAlthough the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a \"tremendous success\". \n\n\n\nThe pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards \"the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\" and promises \"new relations\" between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\n\n\nIn a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using \"gangster-like\" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.\n\n\n\nBut this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US president tweeted. Part of it read: \"I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition.\"\n\nWhen Prime Minister Solberg met Mr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jet only available in Call of Duty, a computer game. \n\n\n\nA day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. \n\n\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics. \n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations.\n\n\"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.

No more!\" Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.\n\n\n\n\"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.\"\n\n\n\nBut he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years.\n\nBut with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\" The tone has changed between Mr Trump and President Abbas since they met in New York last September (Getty Images) Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. \n\n\n\nHe said there was a \"very good chance\" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: \"We will get this done\".\n\n\n\nDuring a visit to Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would \"do everything\" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. \n\n\n\nIn September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to \"improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people\".\n\n\n\nBut Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.\n\n\n\nThe move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to \"comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem\". \n\n\n\nThe US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it.\n\nPresident Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. \n\n\n\n\"The Panama Canal is doing quite well,\" he said at the White House meeting. \"I think we did a good job building it.\"\n\n\n\nMr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying \"things are going well\" and \"the relationship has been very strong\". \n\n\n\nDuring a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia,", "bollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian Territories. The overseas arm of its Revolutionary Guards Corps is called \"the Quds force\", meaning \"the Jerusalem force\".\n\n\"Iran has always used Jerusalem as a sort of narrative when stirring up Arab masses, it's what helped it align with Hamas... so I think it will definitely play into the hands of Iran,\" said Hediya Fathalla.\n\nHezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah are fiercely opposed to Israel\n\nCommenting this weekend in the online edition of IISS Voices for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which organises the Manama Dialogue, Elisabeth Marteu also believes the announcement will help Iran's interests.\n\n\"This would be a great boost to Tehran, which is trying to repair its image after the Syria and Iraq conflicts,\" she writes.\n\nOver time, the damage to US relations with its Gulf Arab partners will be repaired. Washington is simply too big, too powerful and too important an ally to ignore.\n\nThe US Fifth Fleet patrols the Gulf, providing a counterweight to Iran, while sophisticated US weaponry makes up much of the region's arsenals.\n\nBut the recent US announcement is a reminder to rulers here that this White House administration is still capable of causing them intense embarrassment.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Baby M death: Police search for two people seen on CCTV\n\nPolice investigating the murder of a newborn girl whose body was discovered in a park have released CCTV footage of two people they want to speak to.\n\nBaby M was found dead in Manor Park, Aldershot, on 19 May. It is thought she was born about three days earlier.\n\nThe two people in the footage walked up and down nearby Ash Road 10 times in an hour on 15 May, police said.\n\nA post-mortem examination revealed the child died from \"deliberately inflicted\" head injuries, police said.\n\nShe suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head, with other minor injuries to her body, and died within six hours of being born.\n\nIt is thought the birth took place under this tree in Manor Park\n\nThe body of the baby was discovered in Manor Park, Aldershot, in May\n\nDet Ch Insp Dave Storey, of Hampshire Constabulary, said analysis by the National History Museum found the birth would most likely have happened under a tree in the park between 18:00 BST on 15 May and 08:00 the following day.\n\nHe added a DNA profile taken from the baby, whose body was discovered at the edge of the park by a council worker, showed that both she and her mother, and probably the child's father, were of east Asian ethnicity.\n\n\"This remains a particularly sad case in which, despite extensive investigation, we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby Baby M, nor her mother,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a baby who is unnamed and, at this stage, is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M.\"\n\nHe added the force was still trying to identify the mother and offer support \"because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards\".\n\nFlowers were left at the park gates following the discovery of the baby's body\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThere have been 4,000 suspected cases of diphtheria in the overcrowded refugee camps and at least 31 deaths.\n\nMedics in the camps are seeing 100 new cases every day.\n\nAnt McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong were together for 23 years\n\nAnt McPartlin has confirmed he is divorcing Lisa Armstrong after 11 years of marriage.\n\nThe presenter, who co-hosts several ITV shows with Declan Donnelly, released a statement on Sunday, asking for privacy \"for both himself, Lisa and their immediate families\".\n\nThe couple met in 1994 when they were performing as singers on the Smash Hits tour in Newcastle.\n\nThey were together for 23 years and married in 2007.\n\nThe Sun is also reporting that Armstrong has hired lawyers Harbottle and Lewis to negotiate a \u00a331m divorce settlement. The BBC has requested a comment from the firm.\n\nThe Bafta-winning star spent two months in rehab last year after admitting his painkiller and alcohol addiction.\n\nIt stemmed from a painful knee operation in 2015, when Armstrong - a TV make-up artist - and Donnelly encouraged him to get help.\n\nAnt and Dec returned to screens in November 2017\n\nThe 42-year-old, who presents Britain's Got Talent, I'm A Celebrity and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, spoke to The Sun on Sunday last year about his difficult time.\n\n\"I was at the point where anything - prescription drugs, non-prescription drugs - I would take,\" he said.\n\n\"And take them with alcohol, which is ridiculous. The doctors told me, 'You could have killed yourself'.\"\n\nHe revealed he was clean from drugs and alcohol in August and returned to presenting duties in November last year on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

David Lidington says wages will be paid to staff working on public sector contracts\n\n\"All employees should keep coming to work, you will continue to get paid. Staff that are engaged on public sector contracts still have important work to do,\" said government minister David Lidington.\n\nCarillion is involved in major projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons.\n\nIt is the second biggest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs there would be a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday to discuss the situation.\n\nCarillion chairman Philip Green said it was a \"very sad day\" for the company's workers, suppliers and customers.\n\nThe company has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Labour asks why the government did not act when profit warnings were issued\n\nThere are also thousands of small firms that carry out work on Carillion's behalf - many of those have contacted the BBC with concerns about whether they will be paid.\n\nOne company, which provided services for Carillion's prisons contract, told the BBC that it might fail if it is not paid the \u00a380,000 owed to it.\n\nA worker on the Midland Metropolitan Hospital, who wanted to only be identified as Philip, told the BBC: \"Everyone on the site got told: 'That's it, go home.' My company said, 'You've been laid off.'\n\n\"They've literally locked the gate. They've told us we can get our personal tools off the site if they're small, but that's it.\"\n\nDamned if they did, damned if they didn't?\n\nThe government refused to insure Carillion's debts, so the banks pulled the plug. If it had offered guarantees to big banks on behalf of a private company it might have been accused of nationalising losses while privatising profits.\n\nThe whole point of having private companies do public work is that they shoulder some of the risk. The truth is the government has been helping out Carillion for a while. Awarding it contracts when it knew it was in trouble raised eyebrows last year.\n\nThe government constructed the HS2 contracts so that", "that lifting lower wages by increasing, for example, productivity levels, could be a more effective way of reducing the gap between low and high pay, although it would take many years of concerted effort to be successful.\n\nSince the 1970s, the notion of a government inspired \"incomes policy\" has been - in the popularity stakes - right up there with multi-millionaire bankers at a meeting of Momentum, the organisation that supports Mr Corbyn's Labour leadership.\n\nBut, ever since the introduction of the minimum wage in the 1990s, the government has made it clear that the amount people are paid is not simply a matter for private businesses and the free market.\n\nMr Corbyn has said he wants to consider a national maximum wage.\n\nMany might nod in agreement.\n\nHow to do it, though, and whether it is economically helpful for growth, is a very different matter.\n\nMore than 200 people attended the funeral of a World War Two veteran who died with no surviving family.\n\nReginald Watson, who served in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, died on 23 November aged 90.\n\nThe Reverend Mandy Bishop, of Ormesby St Margaret, Norfolk, made a social media plea for mourners after learning he faced a pauper's service.\n\nShe said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the response to details of the funeral, which she had posted on Facebook.\n\nThe service at St Margaret's Church heard Mr Watson was a \"quiet, unassuming\" man and \"perfect gentleman\" who had treasured his certificate of service book.\n\nMr Watson enlisted in Norwich in January 1945, aged 18. He was initially in the General Service Corps and then in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He served until 1948.\n\nThe funeral saw Royal British Legion standard-bearers line the path from the hearse to the church.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Cricket\n\nMS Dhoni has stepped down as India's limited-overs captain ahead of the ODI series against England, which begins on 15 January.\n\nThe wicketkeeper will, however, remain available for selection for the three-match series and the three subsequent Twenty20 internationals.\n\nDhoni, 35, had been India's limited-overs captain since September 2007.\n\nUnder his leadership, India won the 2007 World Twenty20, 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy.\n\nTest captain Virat Kohli - ranked second in the world's ODI batting rankings - is the leading candidate to replace Dhoni.\n\n\"The Indian team has touched new heights and his achievements will remain etched forever in the annals of Indian cricket,\" said Rahul Johri, chief executive of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\n\nDhoni led his country in 199 ODIs and 72 Twenty20 internationals, also taking charge of 60 Tests between 2008 and 2014, to hold the overall record for the most international matches as captain with 331.\n\nIn terms of victories, he is the most successful captain in all three formats in Indian cricket history.\n\nHe was put in charge of the India squad for the inaugural World T20 in South Africa in 2007, leading his side to a five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final.\n\nIt was this success which is credited with starting his country's obsession with the shortest format of the game.\n\nAlready established as a powerful middle to lower-order batsman, Dhoni developed a reputation as an adept finisher in run chases, as epitomised by his man-of-the-match performance in the 2011 World Cup final.\n\nThe captain struck 91 off 79 balls, including a six to win the game, as he guided India to a six-wicket win against Sri Lanka in front of a raucous home crowd in Mumbai.\n\nThere was further success in a dramatic five-run victory over England in the 2013 Champions Trophy final at Edgbaston, before finishing runners-up to Sri Lanka in the 2014 World T20 in Bangladesh.\n\nNdekela Mazimba, who works in PR, says Mother's Day helps her manage her period pain\n\nDiscussing female menstruation publicly is something of a taboo in Zambia.\n\nThis is no doubt why a provision in the country's labour law that allows female workers to take off one day a month is known as Mother's Day, even though it applies to all women, whether or not they have children.\n\nThe legal definition is not precise - women can take the day when they want and do not have to provide any medical justification, leading some to question the provision.\n\n\"I think it's a good law because women go through a lot when they are on their menses [periods],\" says Ndekela Mazimba, who works in public relations.\n\nMs Mazimba is neither married nor does she have children but she takes her Mother's Day every month because of her gruelling period pains.\n\n\"You might find that on the first day of your menses, you'll have stomach cramps - really bad stomach cramps. You can take whatever painkillers but end up in bed the whole day.\n\nMutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela says there are already too many holidays in Zambia\n\n\"And sometimes, you find that someone is irritable before her menses start, but as they progress, it gets better. So, in my case, it's just the first day to help when the symptoms are really bad.\"\n\nWomen in Zambia do not need to make prior arrangements to be absent from work, but can simply call in on the day to say they are taking Mother's Day.\n\nAn employer who denies female employees this entitlement can be prosecuted.\n\nMs Mazimba's boss, Justin Mukosa, supports the law and says he understands the pressure women face in juggling careers and family responsibilities.\n\nA married man himself, he says the measure can have a positive impact on women's work:\n\n\"Productivity is not only about the person being in the office. It should basically hinge on the output of that person.\"\n\nBut he admits there are problems with the current system in terms of losing staff at short notice and also the temptation for people to play the system:\n\n\"It could be abused in the context that maybe an individual might have some personal plans they wish to attend to so she takes Mother's Day on the day.\n\nNdekela Mazimba's (R) boss Justin Mukosa (L) is supportive of the law\n\nNot everyone is so supportive of Mother's Day, and there are many women among the critics.\n\nMutinta Musokotwane-Chikopela is married and has three children.\n\nShe has a full-time marketing job but never takes Mother's Day, arguing that it encourages laziness in working women.\n\n\"I don't believe in it and I don't take it. Menses are a normal thing in a woman's body; it's like being pregnant or childbirth,\" she says.\n\n\"I think women take advantage of that, especially that there's no way of proving that you are on your menses or not.\"\n\nMs Chikopela says the provision should have been made more clear in the law.\n\n\"The problem in Zambia is that we have too many holidays - including a holiday for national prayers. So I guess Mother's Day makes those that love holidays happy.\"\n\nWomen in Zambia are traditionally the primary care-givers in the family\n\nThe Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the umbrella body representing the country's workers, is also a supporter of the law.\n\nBut the entitlement \"would have to be forfeited\" if a woman were to take it on a day that she was not on her period, says Catherine Chinunda, national trustee at ZCTU.\n\n\"We have been educating women about Mother's Day, telling them that on that day, they are supposed to rest and not even go shopping or do other jobs because that is wrong,\" she says.\n\nThe law itself provides no guidance about what is allowed and it would appear that very few, if any, employers have internal policy guidance in that respect.\n\nShe dismisses the idea that men should also get a day off every month, as has been suggested by some:\n\n\"Men sometimes go to drink and miss work\u2026", "mese: \"The houses are not yet built.

Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts to BBC Newsnight\n\nThe agreement covers Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh following attacks by a Rohingya militant group on police posts in October 2016 and August 2017.\n\nThose attacks triggered a military crackdown that led to widespread allegations of killings, rape and torture of Rohingya.\n\nThe agreement does not cover Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh prior to October 2016, under previous crackdowns and bouts of communal violence.\n\nWhen the initial repatriation deal was signed in November, Amnesty International said it doubted there could be safe or dignified returns \"while a system of apartheid remains\" and added that it \"hoped those who do not want to go home are not forced to do so\".\n\nThe Rohingya are a stateless minority in Myanmar, also known as Burma.\n\nThe crisis has been described as ethnic cleansing by the UN and the US.\n\nDespite widespread accusations of human rights violations, Myanmar has consistently denied persecuting its Rohingya minority.\n\nThe UK's inflation rate has fallen for the first time since June, mainly because of the impact of air fares.\n\nThe inflation rate dipped to 3% in December, down from November's rate of 3.1% - a six-year high.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that while air fares rose last month, it had a smaller impact than at the same point in 2016.\n\nIt added that a drop in the price of toys and games also contributed to December's fall.\n\nThe ONS said it was too early to say whether this was the start of a longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation.\n\nThe Bank of England has said it thinks inflation peaked at the end of 2017 and will fall back to its target of 2% this year.\n\nThe rate had been rising over the past year, partly due to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote which has pushed up the cost of imported goods.\n\nIn November, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%.\n\nBut Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The continued weakness of underlying price pressures means that the MPC has little need to rush the next rate hike.\"\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O'Carroll agreed there was no need for another quick rise in interest rates, but said: \"What matters most for the long-term health of the UK economy is improving its productivity performance.\n\n\"If we can do that then the Bank of England may be able to keep rates low for a lot longer. But on recent experience, improving productivity is much easier said than done.\"\n\nInflation in the year to December was 3%, rather than the previous 3.1%, naturally generating predictions that it has now peaked.\n\nOne of the biggest factors driving inflation has been the inflated price of imports following the Brexit vote feeding through to the shops.\n\nYes, the vote and the devaluation of the pound following it was more than a year-and-a-half ago. But because many retailers buy their stock a year or two ahead, they have only felt the impact of costlier imports in the last few months.\n\nFor the same reason the recent rally in sterling, which if it lasts should bring down the cost of imports, isn't yet benefiting consumers. In fact, taking goods prices separately from services, inflation at 3.4% is higher than it's been for more than five years.\n\nEven if inflation more broadly has peaked, the Bank of England has to bring it down over the next two to three years closer to its 2% target.\n\nOn that basis trading in the City currently forecasts the next interest rate rise will take place in August.\n\nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the drop in inflation was not enough to \"significantly ease the pressure on UK household spending\" because wages were still rising by less than the rate of inflation.\n\nHowever, he said that if that situation changed then \"a sustained trend of falling inflation and better wage growth could spell happier times for the UK consumer, and the UK economy\".\n\nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"We suspect that relatively lacklustre economic growth will continue to limit domestic price pressures.\n\n\"Earnings growth seems likely to pick up only gradually as some firms remain keen to limit their total costs in a challenging and uncertain environment.\n\n\"Fragile consumer confidence may also deter some workers from pushing hard for increased pay rises, despite recent higher inflation and a tight labour market.\"\n\nThe Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, rose to 4.1% last month from 3.9% in November.\n\nThe ONS's preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner-occupiers' housing costs, fell to 2.7% in December, down from 2.8% the month before.\n\nAnti-abortion protesters have been accused of \"harassing\" women attending Marie Stopes abortion clinic in Ealing, London.\n\nNow the local council is considering legal action.\n\nWatch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\n\nFast food giant McDonald's has said all its packaging worldwide will come from sustainable sources by 2025.\n\nThe restaurant chain will aim to get all items like bags, straws, wrappers and cups from recycled or renewable materials, up from half currently.\n\nMcDonald's also wants 100% of its restaurants to recycle packaging by then, compared with only 10% now.\n\nIt comes as UK supermarket Iceland has promised to drastically reduce its plastic packaging by the end of 2023.\n\nBoth companies said there was an overwhelming demand from customers to make packaging more environmentally friendly.\n\nFrancesca DeBiase, McDonald's chief supply chain and sustainability officer, said it was customers' number one request \"to use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use\".\n\nIn the UK, sites no longer use foam packaging and more than 1,000 restaurants have recycling bins for plastics and paper cups.\n\nHowever, the world's biggest restaurant chain, which has 37,000 sites worldwide, said some restaurants might struggle to recycle packaging by 2025.\n\nThat is because infrastructure, regulations and customer behaviour vary around the world, but McDonald's \"plans to be part of the solution\".\n\nFriends of the Earth welcomed the news, but said \"speedier action in some countries, such as the UK is surely possible\".\n\nMcDonald's is already aiming for all its paper and card packaging, such as burger boxes or paper bags, to come from recycled or certified sources where no deforestation occurs by 2020.\n\nIn the UK, retailers have faced outcries over the packaging of coconuts and cauliflower \"steaks\", and shoppers have reacted to vivid images of plastic pollution in Sir David Attenborough's Blue Planet programme.\n\nIceland is aiming to remove plastic from the packaging of more than 1,000 own-brand products within the next five years wherever feasible.\n\nNew ranges will be packaged using a paper-based tray, rather than plastic.\n\nNigel Broad", "a bright spotlight at a police station in Central London, Van Haarlem protested his innocence. Then, 10 days later, things turned really strange: a visitor arrived claiming to be the prisoner's mother. Johanna van Haarlem was a Dutch woman in her early sixties, who peered at detectives from behind huge glasses. Her son was no spy, she insisted, but an honest Dutchman - the child she had abandoned in 1944 and rediscovered 11 years earlier. The baffled detectives allowed her to visit their suspect.\n\n\"Tell me, I'm hearing all these strange stories,\" she said. \"You're not really a spy, are you?\"\n\n\"We have a saying that where you see the smoke, there will be a fire,\" Van Haarlem told her. \"But this time it is not true. Too much of the smoke and no fire. I did absolutely nothing that could harm England.\"\n\nJohanna sighed with relief. \"But why? Why all of this, then?\" she said.\n\n\"Don't ask me. Ask them.\"\n\nAnd then he noticed a tiny red spot on her forearm. The DNA blood test results from the Home Office laboratory indicated, with near certainty, that they were not related. Johanna van Haarlem broke down in tears as her world collapsed.\n\nJohanna van Haarlem was 52 on her first visit to London to meet Erwin\n\nOn 6 February 1989, at London's Old Bailey, prosecutor Roy Amlot told a jury that the defendant had stolen her son's identity.\n\n\"You may think that if he knew all along, it was a cruel thing to do to her,\" he said.\n\nThe trial captivated the press. The Daily Express described Van Haarlem as \"an old-fashioned... slick-suited spy who inhabited a world of dead letterboxes and secret codes\". Exotic beauties came forward to kiss-and-tell about their love affairs with the spy. But the most wounded victim stood in the witness box, the tragic Dutchwoman, Johanna van Haarlem.\n\nOn 4 March 1989, at 11:45, the judge sentenced Erwin van Haarlem to 10 years in prison for espionage. \"He is probably the first person to be tried at the Old Bailey under an alias,\" one senior Scotland Yard officer told a reporter. The \"spy with no name\", as the newspapermen called him, would take his secrets with him to his cell.\n\nAfter months of negotiation and false starts, I met Erwin van Haarlem on a spring day in Prague, in 2016. Although he had lived quietly as a free man for the past 23 years, spies famously do not talk. Introduced to me by the Czech crime journalist, Jaroslav Kmenta, Van Haarlem arrived at a restaurant near the city's Old Town Square, wearing a smart blue blazer. After carefully checking my identification he began, in accented English, to tell me his story.\n\nIt began on 23 August 1944, when he was born Vaclav Jelinek in Modrany, a small village near Prague. His father had owned a small bakery there, selling biscuits and ice creams, until the Communists took power. Young Jelinek enlisted in mandatory military service, and, as the Cold War intensified, he graduated to a position in the Czechoslovak Ministry of the Interior. He dreamed of military valour and excitement. But what he got was mind-numbing shifts and grunt work.\n\nOne day his superiors caught him studying German vocabulary instead of guarding a checkpoint in the snow. They marched him to an upstairs office where he expected disciplinary action. Instead he was introduced to two members of Statni bezpecnost - the Czechoslovak secret State police. The StB was a shadowy spy agency that reported directly to the Soviets.\n\nThe StB agents had studied his file and learned that Jelinek was defiant, a womaniser, highly intelligent, prone to violence, patriotic, and a risk-taker. In other words, perfect spy material. After careful training, they decided he was ready to begin an undercover mission abroad, spying on the West.\n\nThe StB searched through its files of missing persons and assigned Jelinek a false identity - that of a Dutch boy, abandoned at an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague, at the end of World War Two. The child had been born just one day before Jelinek.\n\n\"Your new name,\" they told him, \"is Erwin van Haarlem.\"\n\nHe applied for a Dutch passport, and arrived in London by train in June 1975. To the boy from Prague, it was an alien city swarming with traffic, fashion, and danger. He took a job at the 24th-floor Roof restaurant at the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, Mayfair, hoping to spy on the Royals down the road at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt night, he exchanged coded messages with his home country via radio. One of his first ideas was to try planting listening devices in the Queen's furniture, he recalls, though he and his bosses realised it was technically unrealistic.\n\nHis secret career was running smoothly until late 1977, when he received a disturbing message from Prague: \"YOUR MOTHER IS TRYING TO FIND YOU IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA WITH THE HELP OF THE RED CROSS. SHOULD THE RED CROSS FIND YOU, A MEETING IS TO BE AGREED WITH.\"\n\nHe read the message over and over again. In October of that year, Van Haarlem received a handwritten letter from Johanna van Haarlem. The Dutch embassy had given her his address, she wrote. She was thrilled to find him. As he had been ordered, the spy politely replied in November, enclosing some photographs. He began the letter: \"Dear mother\". When he sent a cordial invitation to visit him in London, she left immediately.\n\nJohanna woke up early on 1 January 1978, in a West London hotel. Her stomach was knotted with nerves. She stepped on to the street littered with the detritus of New Year's Eve. It was her plan to arrive early and check out her son's address. But on the opposite side of the street a familiar-looking young man walked past.\n\n\"Are you Mrs van Haarlem?\" the spy said, stopping in his tracks.\n\n\"Hello Mother, it's your son.\"\n\nThey embraced in the middle of the street. Johanna stepped back to look at him. Tears were rolling down her face.\n\n\"Your father did not have such dark hair,\" said Johanna, studying him. Then she commented that he was shorter than his father.\n\nInside his apartment a champagne cork popped as Johanna breathlessly told him her life story. The bottle had frozen in the refrigerator but Van Haarlem managed to pour a couple of glasses.\n\nShe had grown up in The Hague, in Holland, and was an 18-year-old virgin when she met his father on a train, in November 1943. Gregor Kulig was a Nazi. He was blue-eyed, 23, and Polish. Handsome. At a party four weeks later, she said, he raped her.\n\nAnd when her father discovered she was pregnant, he exploded. \"You are a sinner!\" he told her. He ordered her to take the child to a distant town and give him away.\n\nFull of sadness and desperation, in autumn 1944 Johanna travelled to Czechoslovakia by train. After a brief effort to survive there as a single mother, she walked into an orphanage in Holesovice, Prague. Sobbing, she kissed baby Erwin goodbye, and returned to Holland alone.\n\nHer father - a Jew who had joined the National Socialist Movement to protect his family - destroyed the adoption papers and banned her from ever speaking about her son.\n\nOver the years, dozens of letters arrived from the orphanage asking Johanna to take back her child. They went unanswered. But every year on his birthday, Johanna silently remembered her missing son, his name she could not even speak: Erwin van Haarlem.\n\nNow she had found him. As they finished their champagne, he took her hand in his.\n\n\"You have to believe it,\" he told her. \"I am your son.\"\n\nShortly after their emotional \"reunion\", Johanna invited Erwin to meet the Van Haar", "This Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

If it makes you uncomfortable, why on earth are you watching it?\"\n\nFriends is now running on Netflix\n\nHe told the BBC his reaction to the criticism of Friends was \"sigh and despair\".\n\n\"If you take it at face value and apply modern day sensibilities to it and look at it as someone who went out to make it in 2018, you would be shocked.\n\n\"We have to be grown up about this, we have to look at perspective and look at the context in which it was made.\n\n\"It's fine to say it's uncomfortable by today's standards but if you're not careful you look at the world from an insular, narrow perspective.\"\n\nWard says \"we're in such a sensitive era now\" with comedy.\n\n\"Friends has been on Comedy Central for ages, it's not as if someone's just found it and put it out there. I don't think it's caused any major harm. And the characters - by and large we were laughing at their ridiculousness. They're not role models.\"\n\nWard adds Fawlty Towers is one of his favourite shows.\n\n\"I'm not thinking, 'Wow, I'm laughing at it because it's racist - it's a long, long time ago, it's a different age. I'd like to think we're smart enough not to have to be protected as if things have never been different.\n\n\"And there's a bit of arrogance - thinking we're so perfect now.

However, the operation was hampered by poor visibility.\n\nCampbeltown RNLI Lifeboat was out all night on Thursday searching for the missing men.\n\nIt is understood the entire Tarbert fishing fleet has also been helping with the search efforts.\n\nA spokesman for Tarbert and North Kintyre Churches said: \"This is a close-knit fishing community and everyone is absolutely devastated by what has happened.\n\n\"The Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland are working closely with Matthew Ramsay of the Fishermen's Mission in Argyll to support the community and the emergency services personnel involved in the search operation.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this heart breaking incident.\"\n\nThe rescued fisherman was taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in L", "Mr Rees said: \"No-one is suggesting it's him [Mr Robinson] in person but obviously people who follow Tommy Robinson.\"\n\nThe invitation referred to the bombing by Salman Abedi at the Manchester Arena in May, saying the incident was \"not the beginning and it won't be the end\", the court heard.\n\nOpening the trial on Monday, Mr Rees said Mr Osborne had become \"obsessed\" with Muslims and the Rochdale grooming scandal after watching a BBC TV drama.\n\nHe said it was believed Mr Osborne had been planning to target a march in central London, organised by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, on 18 June but was prevented by road closures that were put in place.\n\nThe trial was adjourned until Wednesday.\n\nChildren will lack the work skills they need in the future because they are not spending enough time playing, a Lego executive has warned.\n\nJohn Goodwin, head of Lego's charitable arm the Lego Foundation, says less time in the classroom and more time playing is the solution.\n\nThe foundation has a 25% stake in the Danish toy maker, giving it a vested interest in encouraging play.\n\nMr Goodwin admits there could be a perceived conflict of interest.\n\nHowever, he says the foundation's aim is much broader.\n\nMr Goodwin is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, the annual gathering of top business and political leaders, in a bid to persuade them of the importance of play.\n\nHe took over running the foundation last year after a spell as Lego's chief financial officer.\n\nHe hopes the Davos elite will put pressure on governments to make education more play-based.\n\nIf not, he believes companies will find it increasingly difficult to hire the type of staff they need: \"Critical thinking and problem solving starts in early childhood development. It's where the foundations are laid.\"\n\nMr Goodwin said technological advances, particularly the growth of the internet, meant that knowledge itself had become obsolete.\n\nInstead he said it was now more important to teach children how to learn, and work things out for themselves, with play being one way to achieve this goal.\n\nYet in a warning that will be familiar to many parents, the Lego Foundation chief says the \"increasingly overscheduled world\" of children has resulted in less time for them to do so.\n\nThis could have \"serious long term consequences\" for companies, he said.\n\nLego Foundation chief John Goodwin has his contact details on a Lego figure rather than a conventional business card\n\nMr Goodwin is not the first to warn about the issue: several studies have linked a drop in play with negative consequences.\n\nDr Peter Gray, a US psychologist and professor at Boston College, has argued that the fact children play less has led to an increase in childhood mental disorders including anxiety and depression, as well as a decline in empathy.\n\n\"In play, children themselves must decide what to do and how, and they must solve their own problems\u2026 and thereby develop competence and confidence,\" he wrote recently.\n\nArchitect Frank Lloyd Wright and artist Paul Klee were also strong advocates of \"block play\" for children, to help develop spacial awareness and imagination. They used Froedel Blocks as kids.\n\nSome firms are attempting to address the issue.\n\nConsumer goods giant Unilever and furniture retailer Ikea Group together with the Lego Foundation are launching The Real Play Coalition this week, aimed at raising awareness about the importance of play\n\n\"I'm very optimistic about what it can achieve,\" says Mr Goodwin as he hands me his business card: a Lego mini figure look-a-like that carry his contact details.\n\nIt might be a gimmick, but it's still a lot more fun than the usual white card.\n\nHe also admits to carrying a handful of Lego bricks in his pockets - it seems Mr Goodwin very much practises what he preaches.\n\nDolores O'Riordan's ex-husband Don Burton and their children Taylor, Molly and Dakota Burton\n\nThe funeral of Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan has taken place in County Limerick.\n\nThe service, led by family friend Canon Liam McNamara at St Ailbe's Church in Ballybricken, will be followed by a private family burial.\n\nSome Irish radio stations simultaneously played the band's 1996 hit, When You're Gone, after the midday news.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It's so great.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 52 will be a rematch of the 39th staging of the annual finale to the NFL season, when quarterback Brady threw two touchdown passes and the Patriots won 24-21 for their third title in four seasons.\n\nThey could complete the same run of success in two weeks when they play in a record 10th Super Bowl.\n\nThe Eagles, whose other Super Bowl appearance in 1981 also ended in defeat, last won an NFL title in 1960 before the Super Bowl era began.\n\nBrady, who needed stitches for an injury to his right hand suffered in practice on Wednesday, completed 26 of 38 passes for 290 yards, 138 of them in the fourth quarter, as the Patriots clinched the AFC Championship.\n\n\"We said whatever it takes,\" said the 40-year-old. \"That was a great second half.

But they equally realise their constitutional duty to accept the leadership of the politicians, of the elected government.\"\n\nThe former chancellor, who was one of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's strongest supporters until they fell out in 1989, thought the 1980s provided a useful parallel.\n\nHe said: \"Brexit is a most radical change of direction for this country. The idea that any bureaucrat could be in favour of radical change is a nonsense. Bureaucrats by their very nature loathe radical change of any kind.\n\n\"I was... a member of the Thatcher government. We came in and introduced radical change in economic policy. All the officials were aghast. They thought it would be a disaster. But at that time we had a strong cabinet led by an outstanding prime minister and they accepted the political leadership as is their constitutional duty.\n\n\"So we made this radical change and it worked out very well. It is really the job of the government, the cabinet and above all the prime minister to force this through.\"\n\nSir Jeremy rallied to the defence of the civil service. In a statement issued to Newsnight, the cabinet secretary said:\n\n\"The civil service has always prided itself on supporting the elected government of the day in carrying out its mandate. In this case the mandate has come from the British people, has been endorsed overwhelmingly by Parliament and is the driving mission of the current government.\n\nSir Jeremy Heywood said the civil service prided itself on supporting the mandate of the government of the day\n\n\"The civil service is putting enormous effort and many of its very best people into making a success of the project. It is being tested on a daily basis and I am very proud of what we have - so far - delivered. Morale is at record-levels, proving once again that the civil service is at is very best when under pressure.\"\n\nThe criticisms by Lord Lawson, who stressed that he was speaking about the civil service in general because he does not know Mr Robbins, reflect the private views of some cabinet ministers.\n\nOne senior minister said he believes that Mr Robbins regards Brexit as a crisis to be managed rather than an opportunity to be seized.\n\nSpeaking anonymously, the minister told Newsnight:", "how many steps we've taken really motivate us to do more exercise and eat more healthily?\n\nIn short, do they really work?\n\n\"They've made us all aware of how we treat our bodies, and they have even helped people diagnose things like diabetes and obesity,\" says Collette Johnson, head of marketing at design technology consultancy Plextek.\n\n\"But I feel they could go further.\"\n\nLast year the University of Pittsburgh concluded that fitness trackers were \"ineffective at sustaining weight loss\".\n\nThe two-year study, conducted by the university's School of Education Department of Health and Physical Activity, involved 500 overweight volunteers. All were asked to diet and engage in more exercise, but only half were given a fitness tracker to help them.\n\nDo fitness trackers make us more or less motivated?\n\nThe study found that the group wearing trackers lost 8lb (3.6kg), but the ones who didn't lost 13lb (5.9kg).\n\n\"Trackers are a reliable measurement of our activity, but we can't rely on them completely,\" says Andrew Lane, professor of sport psychology at the University of Wolverhampton.\n\n\"We can't expect just to buy one and that's it - some of the responsibility sits with us too. We still have to get off that sofa and complete those 10,000 steps a day.\"\n\nProf Lane believes that, if used inappropriately, they may even start to have a negative psychological effect.\n\n\"What if we start consistently not reaching goals set for us by them? Ultimately it would lead to us feeling demotivated - the opposite effect they are supposed to have.\"\n\nSuch concerns haven't stopped the market from booming - yet.\n\nLeading wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit reported 2015 revenues of \u00a31.3bn, while researcher CSS Insight forecasts that the market will be worth \u00a316bn by 2020.\n\nAnd the fact that smartwatch sales declined sharply last year, according to market analysts IDC, has led many makers to reposition them primarily as fitness-tracking devices - another indication of where the business potential lies.\n\nBut is the problem with them that they are neither accurate nor sophisticated enough yet?\n\n\"As well as providing data for us, companies need to provide coaching with this data. They need to take responsibility for the results they're providing us,\" says Prof Lane.\n\nPlextek's Collette Johnson thinks trackers need to give us more tailored advice\n\nAnd Plextek's Ms Johnson thinks they need to understand more about the individual user.\n\n\"They need to recognise whether Sharon from Uxbridge really should be doing two hours of fitness a week, how that's going to impact upon her body, her joints, whether she's at risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\"Fitness trackers can be too generic, personalising them will motivate us more,\" she tells the BBC.\n\nApps, like the Slimming World app, may be better for achieving sustained weight loss, she argues, because they allow you to track your weight loss progress and give you incentives after it has recorded your exercise.\n\n\"There is no doubt the industry is booming, but for it to really see results it needs not only to give us results, but to make them as personalised and as accurate as possible.\"\n\nSo what tech innovations are making fitness tracking more effective?\n\nGenetics and nutrition firm DNAFit advises on how we should be training and what we should be eating after testing our genes and applying its algorithm to the analysis.\n\nYou take a saliva swab and send it off to the company's lab. After 10 days a report tells you which exercises your body will respond to best and which foods you should be eating. The company says its technology platform has been peer reviewed and clinically tested.\n\nAndrew Steele, DNAFit's head of product, shows how to take a saliva swab for DNA testing\n\nOther companies such as FitnessGenes, Genetrainer and AnabolicGenes adopt similar approaches.\n\nJo Rooney, 35, a deputy headteacher, used the test to try to cure her stomach problems.\n\n\"My results came back quite quickly and told me that I was actually lactose intolerant and had a high sensitivity to gluten.\n\n\"This did mean quite a radical change to my diet, and a lot more forward planning, but within a week I felt a lot less bloated, lost weight and I'd stopped having stomach problems.\"\n\nBody scanners and tech built into sports clothes are also giving us more detailed results.\n\nFor example, Fit3D uses scanners to assess the whole body to calculate body fat percentage, assess posture and give body shape scoring.\n\nWhile last year, OMsignal launched OMbra, a smart sports bra that tracks heart rate, breathing and distance between steps, and shares this data with a smartphone app.\n\nThe OMbra is a wearable fitness tracker that's really wearable\n\nProf Lane believes that we're also going to start seeing biometric devices integrated not just into clothes and wearable devices, but directly on to our bodies as well.\n\nFor example, US tech firm Chaotic Moon Studios - now called Fjord - has created a prototype tech tattoo - a skin-mounted monitor that connects to your smartphone to monitor heart rate, blood pressure and even track movement via GPS.\n\nNow we just need an injection of willpower.\n\nWhat seemed to be a certainty is now not so sure.\n\nAll of the noises, particularly from the man himself, pointed towards Alastair Cook ending his 59-Test reign as England captain.\n\nBut Thursday's news that Cook will be given as much time as he needs to decide on his future hints at a greater possibility he will remain in charge.\n\nWhat might persuade him to stay? What might more Cook mean for the England side? And what happens if it goes wrong?\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThrough a combination of Cook's words and demeanour on a thoroughly miserable winter tour of India.\n\nEven before the start he admitted he was looking forward to not being captain, going on say he had \"questions\" over his future and he needed time to think about his position.\n\nThat Cook may be tired of the rigours of captaincy is no surprise, he is over four years into a job that no-one has managed to do for more than five since 1961.\n\nAnd, during a gruelling schedule of seven back-to-back Tests in Bangladesh and India, he cut an increasingly gloomy figure, especially after England lost the final two matches by an innings despite posting first-innings totals in excess of 400.\n\n\"When you have presided over something so cataclysmic in sporting terms as that, then it is only natural that Cook may be thinking differently about his future as captain,\" said BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew after England lost the fifth Test in Chennai.\n\nAll of this suggested Cook would call time on his tenure in his regular post-series review with England director of cricket Andrew Strauss, his good friend and former opening partner.\n\nThat meeting takes place on Friday, but we now know Cook's future will not be decided.\n\nTime may just heal all wounds.\n\nCook has been close to quitting before, only to be talked out of jumping ship by his wife Alice. It could be that a Christmas at home and discussions with his closest confidant have pushed the 32-year-old in the direction of staying.\n\n\"They really are a team,\" said Agnew of Cook and his wife. \"The time he is taking means that Cook is making the right decision for him. He will be incredibly comfortable with what lies ahead.\"\n\nThe opener, England's record Test runscorer, is approaching this decision very much in the way he constructs an innings.

For families where the third child is born after April 2017, the changes have no effect and the impacts the chart is showing still hold\n\nMs Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I'm making a number of changes to our welfare system to make sure that it delivers on the intent which is to be a safety net and also to be a compassionate and fair system helping people into work.\"\n\nAhead of a speech on Friday announcing the changes, she also signalled a benefit freeze introduced in 2016 might not be renewed when it comes to an end next year.\n\n\"It was the right policy at the time... I look forward to it coming off,\" she told Sky News.\n\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment:\n\nIt was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and is being introduced in stages across the UK.\n\nConfirming she would delay asking MPs to authorise the transfer of three million people from the old benefits system, she told Today: \"We have listened to people. We know they want more individual assistance either with getting payments more regularly or having payments made direct to landlords.\"\n\n\"These elements, which could help universal credit work more helpfully for individuals receiving it, are what I'm going to be changing.\"\n\nShe also said she wanted to ensure that the main carer in a household would be the primary recipient of universal credit.\n\nOn the two-child limit, she will say in her speech later that it was \"not right\" for it to apply to those who had their children before the cap was announced.\n\n\"These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place,\" she will say.\n\nThe \"child element\" of universal credit varies, but is worth at least \u00a3231.67 a child per month.\n\nMs Rudd, who became work and pensions secretary in November, accepted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to \"learn from errors\" and \"adjust\" the system after taking expert guidance.\n\nHer predecessor Esther McVey had already announced changes to ensure claimants were given more time to switch to the benefit and would not have to wait so long for their money.\n\nThe system had been the target of complaints that it was forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMs Rudd will defend the introduction of the benefit by saying: \"Universal credit is working for the vast majority of people.\n\n\"As a nation, I believe we all want a decent safety net: if you're facing a difficult moment in life, the state should be there to help you.\n\n\"But it is vital that people are supported by this safety net, not trapped beneath it.\"\n\nShadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the government should abandon the two-child limit in its entirety.\n\n\"Universal credit is clearly failing and the government should stop the roll out now,\" she said.\n\nFormer Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions committee, said: \"I strongly welcome the secretary of state's decision not to press ahead with what could have been the cruellest benefit cut in history.\n\n\"At the eleventh hour, she has prevented thousands of children from being plunged into poverty by an unjustifiable retrospective policy.\"\n\nThis speech is billed as a reset of universal credit, a clear acknowledgment from Amber Rudd that further tinkering with the troubled reform will no longer do.\n\nThe last two budgets have seen billions spent trying to reduce the problems that have become ever-more obvious, from increasing use of food banks to private landlords refusing to take people on universal credit.\n\nBut this speech demonstrates that Amber Rudd believes a more fundamental assessment of the benefit is needed. That makes her the first work and pensions secretary since Iain Duncan Smith to try to take responsibility for welfare reform rather than simply managing the existing system.\n\nShe will need to convince the Treasury in particular to back her judgement.\n\nIrresistible Manchester City scored nine goals as they thrashed Burton Albion with an incredible display of attacking football in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at Etihad Stadium.\n\nGabriel Jesus scored four, with Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and Riyad Mahrez also scoring against Nigel Clough's beleaguered League One side.\n\nHeaders from De Bruyne and Jesus made it 2-0, the Brazilian tapped in a third and Zinchenko's curler put City four up.\n\nJesus added two more headers, with Foden, Walker and Mahrez scoring further goals.\n\nThis was the first time in more than 31 years that City had scored more than eight goals in a single match - they beat Huddersfield Town 10-1 in a second-tier league encounter in November 1987.\n\nIt means City have scored 16 goals in four days after thrashing Rotherham United 7-0 in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday.\n\nThe second leg, merely a formality, takes place at the Pirelli Stadium on Wednesday, 23 January, with the final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, 24 February.\n\nCity, the Carabao Cup holders, are set to meet either Tottenham or Chelsea in the final, with Spurs leading 1-0 after Harry Kane's penalty gave them a first-leg victory at Wembley on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Hours stuck on the M6 to witness a 9-0 loss... if they even got there - Burton fans' night to forget\n\u2022 None 'Of course we're in the final' - Guardiola on 9-0 first-leg win\n\u2022 None Relive Manchester City's win over Burton Albion as it happened\n\nCity kill the tie off", "ions at illegal taps before.\n\nThe government is attempting to prevent fuel theft but some argue the strategy has led to fuel shortages.\n\nCamp beds are set up in a lounge in Crystal Palace's ground when temperatures drop below freezing\n\nA Premier League club has offered part of its stadium as an emergency shelter for rough sleepers.\n\nCrystal Palace FC will turn part of Selhurst Park in south London into a space where up to 10 homeless people can sleep when temperatures are forecast to drop below freezing.\n\nThey will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities, said Croydon Council, who helped set it up.\n\nEight people used the emergency shelter on Thursday night.\n\nThey slept on camp beds which were set up in a lounge inside the club's ground.\n\nThe new emergency shelter at Selhurst Park can house up to 10 homeless people\n\nCrystal Palace chief executive Phil Alexander said the club wanted to \"be a force in the community\".\n\n\"We are delighted to be collaborating with Croydon Council and their partner agencies to ensure that rough sleepers can find an emergency shelter in the event of severe winter weather,\" he added.\n\nWhen Selhurst Park is unavailable due to home matches, the council said it would continue to refer rough sleepers to other emergency shelters in Croydon and in central London.\n\nThe rough sleepers will also be given a hot meal, breakfast and washing facilities\n\nCouncillor Alison Butler said Crystal Palace was \"setting a standard for other clubs to follow\".\n\n\"Freezing temperatures are a particular safety risk for rough sleepers and this is a wonderful gesture by Crystal Palace for helping us reduce that risk.\"\n\nLast year, the council approved plans to increase Selhurst Park's capacity from 25,456 to more than 34,000.\n\nPalace, who are 14th in the table, travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in the Premier League later.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBetting is a mug's game.

Will Olivia Colman win at this year's Oscars? Does life exist on another planet?\n\nAnd if you're in the mood for a long night, what's next for Brexit? There's plenty to wonder about there. Britain's future is currently about as predictable as a game of blindfolded darts played by left-handed toddlers using their right arms to throw.\n\nNobody has a clue as to what is going to happen. Politicians, commentators and pub bores all have a view they will happily share, but nobody actually knows. Which makes the subject fertile ground for novelists, whose stock-in-trade it is to let their imaginations run wild and hypothesise.\n\nEnter John Lanchester, a first-class essayist and now five-time novelist who has written The Wall, a dystopian tale set in a Britain of the near-ish future. Suffice it to say, things have not gone well.\n\nClimate change (\"the Change\") has done for the country's coastline, which is now beachless and miserable and home to the eponymous Wall: a 10,000km-long, 3m-wide concrete barricade snaking around Britain's perimeter, patrolled by Defenders whose job is to keep out the Others - desperate, homeless migrants from flooded foreign parts.\n\nIf an Other succeeds in breaching the heavily guarded Wall, then the Defender considered most culpable is put out to sea in a dinghy never to be seen or heard of again. It's a bit harsh, but rules are rules.\n\nThe home guard of Defenders is made up of young men and women who are conscripted through a new National Service. It's a minimum two-year posting of joyless 12-hour shifts with statutory leave taken at home with parents to whom they do not speak because \"the olds\" are to blame for not only wrecking the planet, but also thoughtlessly bringing kids into a world without beaches.\n\nThe book has many of the standard tropes of a dystopian novel. There is a totalitarian state operating in a bleak post-industrial landscape caused by a climatic catastrophe, creating the justification for a faceless bureaucracy to suppress and control a cowed population.\n\nOur protagonist is young Joseph Kavanagh, a new recruit to the Wall. He is about to embark on his stint as a Defender and soon discovers his working environment is grim, a \"cold, hard, unforgiving, desperate place\" in which he feels \"trapped\".\n\nThe only way to reduce your stint on the Wall is to become a Breeder and have children, which might seem like a no-brainer but\u2026 \"people don't want to Breed, because the world is such a horrible place.\" So that's out.\n\nKavanagh is reasonable company. You wouldn't rush up to him at a school reunion, but he's a steady chap who might be missing a funny bone but at least is willing to engage in some Wall banter with his fellow recruits.\n\nHe is not a rebellious type. Nor is he particularly scathing about the State or questioning of its questionable moral compass. For instance, it used to allow a few Others \"who showed they had valuable skills\" to stay in the country. But not any more, because doing so would escalate the numbers attempting to gain entry.\n\nA self-defeating policy, you might think, at a time when the country is so short of manpower that Kavanagh's miserable two-year stretch on the Wall might have to be extended by another 12 months.\n\nSurely our rookie conscript would be full of righteous indignation, pointing out the contradictory logic of the state: if it was successfully discouraging the Others by being mean, wouldn't that result in fewer and not more Defenders needed on the Wall? It can't have it both ways, can it Kavanagh? Come on man, sharpen up!\n\nBut he doesn't. He's a trusting soul, which is always a mistake in a dystopian novel. Fortunately he's a good swimmer.\n\nJohn Lanchester's novel Capital became a BBC TV drama in 2015\n\nAnd fortunately for us, John Lanchester is a good writer. As you will know if you've read Whoops! - his non-fiction book about the 2008 financial crisis. He is also a decent novelist. Capital, his previous book - a sort of fictionalised version of Whoops! - did well and was subsequently made into a TV series.\n\nThe Wall could well end up on the telly, too. Dystopias are all the rage with producers at the moment: Black Mirror, The Handmaid's Tale, The Hunger Games etc. It would probably require a little something extra, though.\n\nThe characters we meet in the book are fine as far as they go, which isn't very far in terms of personality development. They are a low-tech, rather parochial crowd, who aren't nearly as dreary as their environment, but you're unlikely to ever find them showboating in front of a table laden with Big Macs.\n\nUnlike Donald Trump, whose proposed wall is one of the many contemporary political issues Lanchester deftly alludes to in a book that owes more to One State's all-encompassing protective Green Wall in Yevgeny Zamyatin's early 1920s dystopian classic We than it does to the current US president's border project.\n\nThe novel We inspired an entire body of so-called speculative fiction including Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four. All are great works. Which The Wall isn't, quite.\n\nIt is very good: a well-structured, well-paced story with a narrative drive that keeps you going through the monotony of life on the Wall. It does, though, fall a concrete slab or two short in terms of its ambition, both intellectually and imaginatively.\n\nIt doesn't stretch or challenge the", "the very least - phone home.\n\nDaleen Berry is a New York Times bestselling writer and author of several books, including Shatter the Silence and Pretty Little Killers.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Football\n\nVenue: Date: Kick-off:Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 live and BBC local radio; text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted he is not ready to quit management, despite saying he is \"arriving at the end\" of his career.\n\nThe 45-year-old made the comments in an interview with NBC, which was aired last weekend.\n\nSpeaking before Friday's FA Cup third-round tie at West Ham, Guardiola said: \"Maybe it was inappropriate to say I'm starting to say goodbye to my career.\n\n\"I'm not thinking that I'm going to retire.\"\n\nGuardiola took over at Manchester City in the summer, after winning 14 trophies in four years at Spanish giants Barcelona and three successive Bundesliga titles with German club Bayern Munich.\n\n\"I said in the interview that I won't be a trainer when I'm 60. But I'm 45. I'm not going to retire in two or three years,\" he continued.\n\n\"I'm not going to train at 60 because I want to do something else in my life.\n\n\"I started playing football young and my career was on the pitch. I want to do something else in my life, but in the next three or four or five or six or seven years.\n\n\"I love my job and I'm in the perfect place to do my job especially here in England.\"\n\n'I never said this club is below the other ones'\n\nGuardiola, whose side are fourth in the Premier League, gave an awkward post-match interview to BBC Sport after Monday's 2-1 win over Burnley.\n\nAnd quotes from the Spaniard appeared in the national newspapers the following day, implying Manchester City are 10 years behind their local rivals Manchester United.\n\nBut Guardiola clarified his comments, saying: \"When I said to compare the titles with Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid, we are behind. If people don't understand that, I'm sorry.\n\n\"In the last five or six years Manchester City achieved more targets and got better and grew the most. It is one of the best clubs in the world by far.\n\n\"But in terms of just the titles, winning the Champions League, we are behind other clubs in the last 20 years.\n\n\"I never said this club is below the other ones.

Luckily Danny Manu has both in spades.\n\nWhen I met this young man from Manchester on the Las Vegas strip, he was desperately tired. His cheap flight from the UK had been delayed by eight hours on a Miami stopover - so he'd dashed from the airport to his AirBnB to drop his luggage, then came straight on to see me.\n\n\"I've not slept for 24 hours but I'm still moving and looking forward to it,\" he says.\n\nDanny's product is called Clik and he bills it as the world's first truly wireless earbuds with live translation. The idea is that you speak in one language and another person hears what you say in their own tongue, either via their own earbuds or via the MyManu smartphone app that Danny has already developed.\n\nSmart wireless earbuds and instant translation are ideas which giants like Apple and Google are addressing with vast investments - so it seems ridiculously ambitious for a one-man band to take them on.\n\nHe has already had a few setbacks. He'd hoped to have a working model ready for CES, but says delays in manufacturing in China mean the earbuds won't be ready for a few weeks.\n\nInstead, he demonstrates the system on a set of ear headphones, getting me to say Bonjour into an iPad which then comes out of his headphones as Hello.\n\nWe struggle with bad connectivity - often an issue when thousands are using the mobile networks at once - but Danny is hoping for a smoother demo in any of 37 languages when his stand is set up at the show.\n\nIt has been an extraordinary journey to get this far.

But [by buying a fake degree], they have still committed fraud and could still be prosecuted,\" she said.\n\nDanny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said all NHS trusts operated rigorous primary checks.\n\nVerification was \"achieved through a variety of channels\" and fraudulent activity would be reported to police, he said.\n\nIn 2015, Axact sold more than 215,000 fake qualifications globally, through approximately 350 fictitious high schools and universities, making $51m (\u00a337.5m) that year alone.\n\nFormer FBI agent Allen Ezell, who has been investigating diploma mills since the 1980s, said: \"We live in a credential conscious society around the world.\n\n\"So as long as paper has a value, there's going to be somebody that counterfeits it and prints it and sells it.\n\n\"Employers are not doing their due diligence in checking out the papers, so it makes it work. It's the damnedest thing we've ever seen.\"\n\nDefence contractor FB Heliservices bought fake Axact degrees for seven employees, including two helicopter pilots, between 2013 and 2015.\n\nOne of these employees, speaking anonymously to the BBC, said soon after he had been given a contract to work on the Caribbean island of Curacao, the local government decided all those working in the territory had to have a degree.\n\n\"We looked into distance learning, and contact was made with this online university.

It's usually something done behind closed doors - but how would you feel about someone watching porn in public? The BBC's Siobhann Tighe describes a troubling experience on a London bus.\n\nIt had been a long day at work. I got on the bus at 7.30 in the evening and it was cold and drizzly. All the passengers were wrapped up in thick coats, hoods and hats.\n\nInside, the bus was softly lit and I was expecting to zone out on my way back home: just let the day go and switch off.\n\nI sat on the lower deck beside a complete stranger and didn't give it a second thought. I was just relieved to get a seat. As we meandered through the London traffic, my gaze was drawn to my neighbour's phone. I wasn't being nosy but in the dim light of the bus, the brightness of his mobile caught my attention even though he was slanting it slightly away from me.\n\nAlthough I didn't mean to or want to, I found myself looking over towards his mobile a few times and then it suddenly occurred to me what was going on. The man beside me was watching porn.\n\nOnce I realised, although I genuinely didn't mean to, my eyes kept on being pulled back to it. I couldn't quite believe it. First he was watching animated porn, with the two naked characters in lurid colours repeating their movements over and over again. Then he started watching a film, which seemed to begin in a petrol station with a large woman in a low-cut yellow top and blonde hair peering into the driver's window.\n\nI didn't hear any sound, apart from a brief few seconds when my fellow passenger pulled the headphone jack out of his mobile, and then reinserted it.\n\nThe man didn't seem to notice my glances towards his phone, maybe because his hood was hampering his peripheral vision. He seemed oblivious to me and others around him, who admittedly wouldn't have been able to see what I saw.\n\nWe eventually arrived at his bus stop and because he had the window seat and I had the aisle, he made a motion that he needed to get out, and he muttered a \"thank you\" as he squeezed past me. I watched him get off and walk down the street.\n\nI felt uncomfortable and annoyed, but I didn't do anything about it. I didn't say anything to him and neither did he pick up on any of my glances or quizzical looks. His eyes didn't meet mine so I couldn't even communicate my feelings non-verbally and it didn't occur to me to tell the driver. Even if I wanted to, it would have been difficult to get to the front of the bus because it was packed.\n\nBut when I got off, questions flooded into my mind about what I had just experienced. What if a child saw that? Are there any laws about looking at porn in public spaces? If there are laws, how easy are they to enforce? Why did this passenger feel public transport was an appropriate place to watch porn, and should I be worried from a safety point of view?\n\nAs a journalist, I also looked at it from his point of view, even though he made me feel uncomfortable. I asked myself: is he within his rights to look at porn on his private device wherever he is? Do civil liberties in our society grant him that freedom?\n\nBut in my heart, I was offended.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I said something because I felt safe and I sensed there'd be support if an argument ensued.\" It worked, and they politely switched the laptop off.\n\nIt certainly got everyone talking, but like me, no-one was sure where the law stood.\n\nAccording to Prof Clare McGlynn from Durham University who specialises in the law around porn, there's little to stop someone viewing pornographic material in public - on public transport, in a library, in a park or a cafe, for example.\n\n\"It's like reading a book,\" she says. \"They are viewing lawful material which is freely available, and restricting people's access to it presents other challenges.\"\n\nIn Prof McGlynn's view, the law would only prevent it if the porn viewer is harassing someone or causing a disturbance.\n\nSo, what do you do? Prof McGlynn describes it as a dilemma.\n\n\"It's like someone shouting at you, calling to you to 'Cheer up, love!'\" says Prof McGlynn. \"Do you confront it, or do you put your head down and walk along?\"\n\nBut when I contacted Transport for London, they appeared to take the case very seriously.\n\n\"If someone has made you feel uncomfortable, for example by viewing pornographic", "full access to samples.\n\nThe country could now be at risk of another ban from international events.\n\nHelleland told BBC Sport she was \"extremely disappointed but not surprised\" Russia did not comply.\n\nThe Norwegian politician added that a Wada panel should convene \"immediately\" to decide whether Russia should be suspended again.\n\nWada says it will refer the issue to its compliance review committee (CRC), an independent body that will next meet on 14 January in Canada, after which it will make a recommendation to Wada's executive committee (ExCo).\n\nWada's athlete committee said it was \"extremely disappointed\" the deadline was missed and that it expected Russia to be declared non-compliant following the process recommended by the CRC.\n\n\"Only this action will be suitable and appropriate in the view of the athletes - anything less will be considered a failure by Wada to act on behalf of clean athletes,\" it said.\n\nHelleland opposed Wada's reinstatement of Russia in September following a state-sponsored doping scandal but was out-voted on the body's executive committee.\n\n\"I am extremely disappointed that Russia did not deliver within the more than three-month time frame they had at their disposal to extract the data,\" she said.\n\n\"Having said that, I am not surprised, this process has unfortunately been going on for years.\"\n\nWada president Sir Craig Reedie said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" after it was confirmed Rusada had missed the deadline and that \"the process agreed by Wada's ExCo in September will now be initiated\".\n\nHelleland added: \"We at Wada must act very rapidly on the actual situation and a decision by the Wada CRC and ExCo should not be delayed - I've strongly suggested that the CRC convene via a teleconference immediately.\n\n\"As soon as we receive a recommendation from the CRC, a teleconference should be organised with the ExCo so that we can discuss and decide on the situation without any further delay.\"\n\nUK Anti-Doping (Ukad) said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the development, with a statement saying: \"Uninhibited access to the Moscow laboratory and the athlete 'LIMS' data, was the first condition of Wada's reinstatement of Rusada in September 2018. At the same time the process to be followed once the 31 December deadline passed was set out.\n\n\"The independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) must now complete its work, and Ukad keenly awaits its recommendation to Wada's executive committee.\"\n\nUnited States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) chief Travis Tygart said the episode was \"a total joke and an embarrassment for Wada\".\n\nHe urged Wada to \"stop being played by the Russians\" and said Rusada should be declared non-compliant.\n\nThe US is one of 16 national anti-doping bodies (Nado) who have called on Wada to suspend Russia.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for its continuing failure to comply,\" Nado leaders said in a statement.\n\n\"After more than three years of review, indecision and compromise in response to the worst doping scandal in the history of sport, the time has come to demonstrate that no individual nor nation is exempt from compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code.\"\n\nThe UK Anti-Doping Athlete Commission also demanded Russia's immediate suspension by Wada.\n\nBut International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach seemed to suggest Russia was not in danger of being suspended for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nHe said: \"With its suspension from the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018, the Russian Olympic Committee has served its sanction, while in other organisations procedures are still ongoing.\"\n\nWada president Reedie said: \"I am bitterly disappointed that data extraction from the former Moscow laboratory has not been completed by the date agreed.\n\n\"Since then, Wada has been working diligently with the Russian authorities to meet the deadline, which was clearly in the best interest of clean sport.\"\n\nIn September, Wada controversially lifted its suspension of Rusada - which was imposed in November 2015 - pending the meeting of conditions in a \"roadmap to compliance\".\n\nOne of the conditions was to allow independent access to the raw data held at the Moscow lab, and in November Reedie had said it was \"very hard to believe\" Russian authorities \"won't deliver\".\n\nBut Wada said on 21 December it had been unable to \"complete its mission\".\n\nThe state-sponsored use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russians in Olympic and Paralympic sports emerged in independent reports in November 2015, and July and December 2016.\n\nWada needs to 'stop being played by the Russians'\n\nUsada's Tygart, who brought down disgraced former US cyclist Lance Armstrong, called on Wada to reinstate a ban on Russian athletes.\n\nHe said: \"In September, Wada moved the goalposts and reinstated Russia against the wishes of athletes, governments and the public.\n\n\"In doing this, Wada guaranteed Russia would turn over the evidence of its state-supported doping scheme by 31 December.\n\n\"No-one is surprised this deadline was ignored and it's time for Wada to stop being played by the Russians and immediately declare them non-compliant for failing yet again to meet the deadline.\"\n\nThe UK Anti-Doping Athlete Commission said Rusada must again be declared non-compliant and suspended.\n\nOn 13 September, the group wrote an open letter to Wada saying to readmit Russia without meeting the conditions it had been set would be \"a catastrophe for clean sport\".\n\nNow those terms have not been met, it said: \"The Russian state needs to prove unequivocally that they have learned from the biggest doping scandal under Wada's watch, and that they will from this date forward be committed to a drug-free, transparent regime across international sport.\n\n\"Otherwise, the Wada compliance review committee and the Wada executive committee must immediately declare Rusada non-compliant.\n\n\"Wada's leadership has the opportunity to stand up for the interests of athletes, their families, their fans and their sport.

This effect was particularly pronounced among young drinkers.\n\nProf Shirley Cramer CBE of RSPH, said: \"The potential health consequences of alcohol consumption are more serious than many people realise,\" with 90% of Britons unaware of the link between alcohol and cancer.\n\nProf Cramer said that only one in six of the public was aware of the new alcohol 14-unit low-risk guidelines, despite them being introduced two years ago. She put this down to the drinks industry failing to update labels.\n\nWarnings are now mandatory on most products \"from tobacco to food and soft drinks, but alcohol continues to lag behind. If we are to raise awareness and reduce alcohol harm, this must change\", she said.\n\nProf Sir Ian Gilmore, of the Alcohol Health Alliance (AHA), welcomed the report: \"Alcohol is linked with over 200 disease and injury conditions, including heart disease, liver disease and at least seven types of cancer.\"\n\nHe accused alcohol producers, of wishing \"to withhold information on alcohol and health from the public\".\n\n\"It is clear from this research that the public want labels to include the drinking guidelines, and we know from our own research that 81% of the public want to see the guidelines on labels. Producers should accept this.\n\n\"We all have a right to know the drinking guidelines, along with the risks associated with alcohol, so that we are empowered to make informed choices about our drinking.\"\n\nBut John Timothy, of alcohol industry standards body the Portman Group, said the research showed \"there was little public interest in a radical overhaul of drinks labelling and strong opposition to cramming more information on packs\".\n\n\"The study shows that 86% of consumers only look at labels for factual information and branding with 80% saying they would like to see less cluttered labels.\"\n\nHe said the Portman Group continually updates guidance to alcohol producers so consumers are provided \"with accurate and accessible health information\".\n\nCall the midwife in Nairobi, Kenya, and you may receive a visit from someone like Margaret Wairimu Maina.\n\nShe sets off on foot looking something like an astronaut, carrying a backpack stuffed full of hi-tech gadgets designed to monitor a baby's health.\n\nThe pack includes a wind-up foetal doppler used for measuring the baby's heartbeat, a portable ultrasound screen, a life-light with matching solar panel, in-ear thermometers, and a range of other medical instruments related to pregnancy.\n\nThe gear has become crucial for her voluntary job as a community health worker.\n\nAlthough the backpack weighs just 5kg (11lb) it'", "60, Barton directed more than 50 works - some adapted by him from the texts of Greek drama.\n\nHe was \"a Shakespeare genius\", RSC artistic director Gregory Doran said.\n\nActor Sir Patrick Stewart said \"the names William Shakespeare and John Barton will be for me forever united\".\n\nSir Patrick, who worked with Barton on The Merchant of Venice, said that no one in his career \"had the impact John had\".\n\nPaying tribute to a \"mentor and friend\", Doran said Barton was \"one of the greatest influences in the acting of Shakespeare of the last century\".\n\nGenerations of actors had been and still were influenced by Barton's series of Shakespeare workshops, Doran said.\n\nDoran recalled directing Malory's Morte d'Arthur, when Barton joined him for sessions \"in which he delivered whole sections of the book from memory, including, most wonderfully, the list of a hundred knights\".\n\nBarton's acclaimed productions include the War of the Roses, Twelfth Night, The Hollow Crown and The Greeks.\n\nJudi Dench, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen are among the actors to have worked with him.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Sci-fi writers have dabbled often with alternative history stories - among the most common is the \"What If The Nazis Had Won The Second World War\" setting - but this huge interactive virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years, sets out to build an ongoing alternative present.\n\nThe story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today's feature-length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony, while pundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It's a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we're not careful.\"\n\nLove's satirical piece has amused people on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nA Facebook post by singer-songwriter Billy Bragg calling the listing a preview of things to come has been shared more than 125,000 times while Star Trek actor George Takei tweeted: \"The Sunday Herald TV section wins today.\"\n\nSeth MacFarlane, creator of animated TV series Family Guy, also tweeted his appreciation while Twitter user Scott Wryn worries Mr Trump may invade Scotland in response.\n\nNot everyone approved of the joke though. One user tweeted: \"They can't even write a TV schedule without filling it with fake news and propaganda.\"\n\nThe Editor of the Sunday Herald, Neil Mackay, tweeted: \"I would like the good people of the world to help me get @realDonaldTrump to read this from today's Sunday Herald. Love from Scotland x.\"\n\nThe president-elect, normally quick to react to criticism, has not responded to the piece so far.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony will take place on Friday 20 January and you can watch the real programme President Trump: The Inauguration at 16:00 GMT on BBC One.\n\nEverton treat Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery to a day to remember after the five-year-old captured the imagination of football fans with his cancer fight.\n\nWATCH MORE: Five-year-old Bradley wins goal of the month\n\nThe two world leaders may have more in common than meets the eye\n\nAt first glance, few people have less in common than Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trudeau is a favourite of global progressives, who see him as a bastion against rising tide of anti-immigrant and protectionist sentiment and who campaigned on appealing to people's \"better angels\".\n\nMr Trump won the US election riding that anti-trade and anti-globalisation wave, and as a political outsider who is free with his insults.\n\nThe relationship between the North American neighbours is a vital one and depends in part on the Republican and Liberal leaders finding common ground, despite differences in personality and policy.\n\nHere are five areas where Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump are somewhat simpatico.\n\n1. They pulled off unexpected election victories after being discounted by rivals and pundits.\n\nPollsters in both countries failed to predict Mr Trudeau and Mr Trump's upsets, and both party leaders were seen as celebrity lightweights by rivals.\n\nIt is a similarity not lost on Mr Trudeau.\n\nIn a 16 December interview with a Montreal radio show host, the prime minister revealed he touched on that \"common ground\" during his congratulatory phone call to Mr Trump following the US election.\n\n\"He and I had a conversation about being knocked around by the media because, present company excluded, that's the experience that I'd had for years of people just slamming me and saying 'he'd never become prime minister,'\" Mr Trudeau said.\n\n2. They embrace politics in the social media age.\n\nThe prime minister and the president-elect both use social media for their political ends.\n\nMr Trudeau and his team know a charming photo opportunity of the photogenic prime minister, from shirtless selfies to yoga poses, can go viral and bolster his popularity at home and abroad.\n\nHe has leveraged social media as a tool to sell his brand of progressive cool to the world.\n\nWhile Mr Trudeau has a healthy Twitter following for a world leader, with nearly 2.4m followers (and over 830,000 on Instagram), his influence on the platform is dwarfed by Mr Trump's 19.7m followers.\n\nA prolific tweeter, Mr Trump wields his influential account to attack opponents, drive the news, and pressure US manufacturers to bend to his agenda.\n\nHe has, however, promised to be more restrained in his Twitter antics after being sworn-in 20 January.\n\n3. They promised to change the way politics is done.\n\nMr Trump vowed during the campaign he would \"drain the swamp\", a catch-all promise for his supporters who see of Washington as a cesspool of lobbyists, corruption, and waste.\n\nDuring the 2015 Canadian election, Mr Trudeau said his predecessor, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, \"turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp\" during his near decade in power.\n\nMr Trudeau promised to put an end to partisanship and patronage in Ottawa, to usher in a more transparent and receptive government, and to make question period respectful again.\n\nThe two have faced critics who say those promises were quick to fall by the wayside.\n\nDonald Trump said he would 'Make America great Again'\n\n4. They harkened to the past in their pitch to voters.\n\nThe two politicians pressed some very powerful nostalgia buttons as they campaigned to lead their countries.\n\nMr Trump's inescapable campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\", borrowed from former US president Ronald Reagan's 1980 race, looked back to a time when voters felt there was more prosperity and opportunity in the United States and when their nation garnered respect on the world stage.\n\nMr Trudeau was more subtle, though his campaign was woven through with a thread of nostalgia, from a promise to recommit troops to overseas peacekeeping efforts to a foreign policy return to when Canadians thought the world saw the country as its good neighbour.\n\nAfter winning the election, Mr Trudeau and his MPs made \"Canada is back\" one of their favourite catchphrases.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, right, Justin Trudeau's father, with former US President Ronald Reagan\n\n5. They followed in their fathers' footsteps.\n\nFred Trump, the first New York real estate magnate in the Trump family, started a million dollar residential real estate business in Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThe Donald learned the business from his father, switching from building low-income housing in New York City's outer-boroughs to luxury towers in downtown Manhattan.\n\nJustin Trudeau grew up surrounded by politics and was once toasted by former US President Richard Nixon, who", "45 European languages as well as Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Indian languages, Chinese and Mongolian.\n\n6.

Dubbed \"gentlemen's gatherings\" in a recent profile in Vocativ, it took place at the city's ancient citadel, a UN world heritage site.\n\nMr Erbil hopes to promote a new image for the region\n\nThe pictures of the 20 men posing in latest Western men's fashion - specifically, the style recently associated with hipsters, replete with the trademark sharp suits, tight trousers and lovingly trimmed beards - became wildly popular on Instagram.\n\nWidely dubbed \"Iraq's first gentleman's fashion club\", Mr Erbil now has some 30 core members and more than 25,000 fans on Instagram, and a Facebook presence too.\n\nThe style may be Western, but Mr Erbil stress that what they are doing mixes \"modernity\" and cultural heritage, by harking back to the lifestyles of the traditional Kurdish landowning class, the effendis.\n\nThe favoured style appears to be mostly hipster-inspired\n\nAccording to the Vocativ article, in days past, the \"effendis\" - literally, \"lord\" or \"master\" - would dress in their finest clothes to attend cultural salons or visit tea shops.\n\nThe group says that the focus of their activity is to organise trade shows and cultural events to promote fashion as \"aesthetic expression\".\n\nBut it is not just about fashion - there is also a serious, almost political side.\n\nMr Erbil sees itself as something almost akin to a movement representing young Iraqi Kurds who are looking for a better life and want to promote Kurdish culture to the world.\n\nThe group even hopes to effect social change and challenge traditional attitudes, particularly on women's rights.\n\nThe Mr Erbil account frequently posts pictures and musings about women's issues in Kurdistan, Iraq and the world.\n\nThe group's account is very popular on social media\n\nThe effect Iraq's near-constant conflict has had on women's lives is also a frequent subject.\n\nEvery Thursday, Mr Erbil writes a post on the \"girl inspiration\", in which they promote women working on behalf of the community.\n\nOne of them is Dashni Morad, who gives workshops in leadership skills to women who survived the massacre and rape of members of northern Iraq's Yazidi sect by IS militants.\n\n\"The effort she puts in for humanity, love and peace is so impressive!\" says a post by Mr Erbil post on 19 January. \"Keep up the good work, you are making us proud.\"\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The state does little to look after them, so responsibility lies with the public - as Will Grant found when he befriended a ginger tomcat.\n\nMy younger sister sometimes reminds me of the apparent indifference I showed when our family cat, Pippit, died in 1991. A slender tabby who lived well beyond her expected years, Pippit enjoyed a long and happy life with us. Finally, at the impressive age of 21, she died just as we returned from a family holiday.\n\nWaking up to find that Pippit hadn't lasted the night, I took it upon myself to break the news to my sister. Sensitivity and tact weren't exactly high in my repertoire when I was 15 - I simply crashed into her room with the line: \"Helen, the cat's dead!\"\n\nI don't know if you've ever seen anyone wake up and immediately burst into tears, but I should take this opportunity to apologise to Helen for what was probably the meanest thing I did to her when we were growing up.\n\nSo, given she has this image of me as callous when it comes to pets - unfair, I hasten to add - she was surprised, when she visited Havana recently, to find just how much Cuba has influenced my attitude towards animals.\n\nThere are no state-funded pet rescue organisations on this communist island, so caring for neighbourhood strays is down to local businesses or residents.\n\nAround a dozen state institutions, from the Central Bank to the Museum of Metalwork, have adopted their own stray dogs. Under the scheme, the homeless hounds are named and duly issued with ID cards, which are placed on their collars to save them from the dog-catcher.\n\nVladimir, a former street dog, with his ID collar in Havana\n\nThe adoption system operates under the premise that they are now officially considered the government buildings' guard dogs, although the ones I've seen are docile street mutts rather than fierce Rottweilers.\n\nThe city government does operate a programme for neutering and spaying strays in Old Havana, but the handful of voluntary animal protection organisations that exist simply can't deal with the sheer numbers across the island.\n\nCubans are by and large dog people. There is a pretty significant culture of dog ownership, even among those who are barely scraping by.\n\nCats, on the other hand get a raw deal. Especially stray ones.\n\nSo, since we arrived in Cuba, we've tried to do our bit. We've already taken in two kittens we found lost and half-drowned during a torrential downpour one night. My girlfriend's mother is now the proud owner of the uniquely named Honorato and Carilda.\n\nBut for my sister, on her recent visit, it was my relationship with Django which really stood out.\n\nA ginger-and-white tomcat, he started life inside our building's parking garage. We would often hear a faint mewing after we parked the car.\n\nAs a kitten, Django would hide deep inside the motor of some diplomat's SUV, seeking refuge by nestling near the carburettor.\n\nOnce he grew a bit and emerged from the darkness of the car park, he was almost instantly adopted by the building.\n\nWe would leave food out for him. As would some Russian neighbours. So, apparently, did Sindi, one of the doormen. He looks like he could find a second job as a nightclub bouncer, but fell for the scruffy, soot-stained Django as much as we did.\n\nDjango was the name my Mum gave the kitten when she came to Havana and it stuck. We were smitten.\n\nEvenings would be interrupted and conversations broken off mid-flow so we could go out and feed him a mixture of leftovers and expensive kibble specially brought in from Mexico.\n\nThe treatment Django received in our building was well above the experience of most alley cats in Cuba with food regularly provided - if not by one neighbour, then another. Sometimes, both.\n\nThat brought with it the inevitable interest of other local waifs and strays. At one time there were three or four more trying to get in on the act. Fair enough - it's a dog-eat-dog world out there for a Cuban cat.\n\nStill, we began to worry. There is a nasty habit in Cuba of angry neighbours removing a constantly barking dog or an unsightly stray cat by feeding it mince laced with rat-poison.\n\nAlternatively - almost as cruelly - the witless pet might be shoved into the back of the", "There's a spirit of quirky eclecticism and larrikin [boisterous or maverick] humour in country Australia that comes out at these sorts of festivals.

You've got to go at least once. One of the entertainers last year nearly cried when he had to go home. He didn't want it to finish,\" he said.\n\nAs the Elvis Express prepared to roll out of Sydney - on what is quite likely to be Australia's most high-spirited rail journey - Simone Collison from Menangle had gathered with her friends for the trip.\n\nThey all wore matching black and white spotted outfits with pink tops and sunglasses.

Here he fondly recalls what life was like on the road with the former England manager.\n\nGraham Taylor and I sat next to one another in commentary boxes here, there and everywhere.\n\nThe first time we were squeezed together in one was for a not-terribly-high-profile match on a Friday night at Brentford. I can still see him bounding up the steps at Griffin Park, wearing a black and white checked jacket, cheerily acknowledging people as he came.\n\nAnd I remember thinking afterwards that Graham Taylor was everything I hoped he would be. He was good fun, charming, engaging, and he had lots to say about the players, the match and all matters surrounding it. And, off air, he wanted to know all about me.\n\nWhen I got to know him better, he would always be great company post-match, often late into the evening. I have never actually met his wife, Rita, his children, or his grandchildren, but I feel as though I have because Graham would tell you exactly what was going on in their lives.\n\nHe loved all sports, particularly athletics and cricket - Graham actually followed England on tour to South Africa. And, believe it or not, he enjoyed the music of both Vera Lynn and Adele, whose albums he bought.\n\nAs a match summariser, I knew that if the game wasn't very good and nothing was happening, Graham was someone you could go off at tangents with, because he had such a wide field of interests. During one such commentary, I remember us discussing how he used to take an annual holiday in Caister-on-Sea, and the merits of that Norfolk seaside town.\n\nBut don't go thinking he was a pushover. There was a steely core to Graham Taylor that all winners have, and he always struck me as one of life's natural leaders - I'm convinced that was one of the secrets behind the many successes he had.\n\nOnce, when we had lost our ticket in an underground car park in Innsbruck, he very nearly persuaded me to tailgate a car through the barrier. He was extremely disappointed that I pulled up short of causing untold damage!\n\u2022 None Ian Botham: Graham Taylor told me to stick to cricket\n\u2022 None Archive: Graham Taylor on 'View from the Boundary'\n\u2022 None Taylor was 'a pal as well as a manager' - Dion Dublin\n\nWhen I turned up at the airport to fly to Euro 2008, Graham appeared with one foot in a plastic boot. He'd injured it somehow, but rather than withdraw from our broadcast team so close to the finals - which he had been advised to do - he travelled all around Austria and Switzerland in some discomfort but without a word of complaint.\n\nBeing under scrutiny as a football manager for most of his life, he could click a switch and go into serious mode at a moment's notice, and what he said carried a real authority.\n\nWe were both part of the commentary team in Montenegro for a European Championship qualifier when Wayne Rooney was sent off for kicking out at an opponent.\n\nThe next morning we were reporting on it into the Breakfast programme, and though Graham was bleary eyed when he arrived in the room, he sat down, clicked into action, and made perfect sense. I recall thinking that had he still been England manager, he would have answered the questions in exactly the same way.\n\nThe way things ended for him with England, and the criticism that came with that, clearly stayed with him. He would often reference it himself and was, sometimes I felt, almost too willing to talk about it.\n\nWe would always try to guide Graham away from large gatherings of England fans because of the greater possibility of someone saying something out of turn in those circumstances.

The 23-year-old thanked party members for \"putting their faith\" in him\n\nThe son of late Labour assembly member Carl Sargeant has been selected by party members to fight the by-election caused by his father's death.\n\nJack Sargeant, 23, was chosen by party members in Alyn and Deeside ahead of the by-election on 6 February.\n\nCarl Sargeant, who had represented Alyn and Deeside in the Assembly since 2003, was found dead in November.\n\nJack Sargeant said he would be \"seeking justice\" for his father and \"getting to the truth about the chain of events that led to his premature death\".\n\nHis father was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay days after losing his cabinet position amid allegations around his personal conduct.\n\nHe had vowed to clear his name, and the first minister has ordered an independent inquiry to consider the circumstances around his sacking.\n\nJack Sargeant said it had been \"extremely difficult\" for his family following the death of his father\n\nJack Sargeant said: \"I am humbled and honoured to have been selected as Labour's candidate.\n\n\"I would like to thank local Labour Party members for the faith they have placed in me.\n\n\"I will be standing on a platform of being a powerful voice for local people - in the proud tradition of my father.\"\n\nHe said he would listen to local concerns about the economy, health and education and promised to \"champion north Wales interests on all these issues\".\n\n\"Whilst friends from the wider Labour family across Britain will be welcome to visit and campaign alongside us to secure victory, I want to emphasise - this will be a locally run campaign,\" he added.\n\n\"I take nothing for granted in this by-election.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru announced that it had selected Carrie Harper on Wednesday.\n\nThe Conservatives had selected former nurse Sarah Atherton as their candidate for the by-election and community councillor Donna Lalek will stand on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nUKIP previously said they would only stand if Jack Sargeant failed to win the Labour nomination.\n\nConservative Sarah Atherton and Liberal Democrat Donna Lalek were the first two candidates selected\n\nCarrie Harper will fight the by-election for Plaid Cymru\n\nThis comes as no surprise but it does confirm that a by-election already due to take place under extraordinary circumstances is likely to be a highly charged affair with the son of the late Carl Sargeant looking to keep the memory of his father alive.\n\nOpposition parties will have to deal with the emotional weight that will inevitably surround his campaign and the undoubted popularity within Labour ranks of his late father, particularly in and around his hometown, and power base of Connah's Quay.\n\nJack Sargeant had made an effort to win the support of Labour members not just through his family connection but also with a focus on local jobs and skills.\n\nThis will presumably be a central part of his campaign, as will thoughts about his father, no matter how difficult that becomes for the leadership of a Welsh Labour party already facing deep divisions within its own ranks about the sacking of Carl Sargeant.\n\nPotential first-time buyers must typically save for eight years to afford a deposit to buy a home, data suggests.\n\nA typical 20% deposit in London is now more than \u00a380,000, according to the Nationwide Building Society.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, the average deposit could be closer to \u00a320,000, the lender said.\n\nThe squeeze on wages and low interest rates makes it more difficult to raise the money than a decade ago.\n\nThe Nationwide, which calculated that house prices rose by 2.6% in 2017, analysed its mortgage data for the cost of the typical first-time buyer's house purchase in each region, based on four times a buyer's income, and from this derived how much a 20% deposit would be.\n\nThe \u00a380,000-plus cost in London is about \u00a330,000 higher than a decade ago.\n\nIn other regions, such as the Midlands and northern England, deposit requirements are similar to 2007, when prices were at their pre-crisis peak. However, real earnings have generally fallen for young people since then and savings rates are low.\n\nThe Nationwide then calculated the length of time it would take for buyers in each region to save such a deposit, based on squirreling away 15% of their take-home pay.\n\nIn most regions, it would take about eight years for the typical buyer to save for a deposit. This rises to nine years in the South East of England and to nearly 10 years in London.\n\nLenders have been told by regulators to set stricter affordability requirements since the financial crisis, to avoid financial stress on the system and on individual borrowers.\n\nThis created noticeable extra pressure on the need for first-time buyers to save compared with before the financial crisis. Many have turned to parents and other relatives to help with the cost.\n\nIona Bain, founder of the Young Money Blog, said this could be dangerous for young borrowers.\n\n\"The Bank of Mum and Dad, or Granny and Grandad, can come with big legal pitfalls, particularly if you're borrowing money with a partner, while trying to grow your money in more exotic ways through crowdfunding or Bitcoin, for instance, could put your whole deposit at risk,\" she said.\n\n\"The only other alternative is to simply save harder for longer. That means putting all your spare change into a home where you'll have to live for many years to come, since you'll struggle to move up the housing ladder.\n\n\"That doesn't sound very attractive if you're not sure about your future and you're trying to keep all your options open.\"\n\nDan Wilson Craw, of the Generation Rent lobby group, said: \"High housing costs are eating into renters' take-home pay which makes saving for a deposit difficult in the country as a whole but near impossible in London and the South East of England.\n\n\"Renters deserve a stable home in return for their rent, but private tenancies simply do not offer this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, demand for mortgages remains relatively static, so lenders are still getting the custom.\n\nBank of England figures show that 65,139 mortgages were approved for house purchases, for new and existing owners, during November. This is very close to the average of the previous six months. The total value of these loans was \u00a311.9bn.\n\nThe figures come the day after the government claimed more than 16,000 first-time buyers have saved thousands of pounds as a result of changes to stamp duty.\n\nThe Autumn Budget abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers of homes up to \u00a3300,000. For properties costing up to \u00a3500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first \u00a3300,000.\n\nAccording to the government, the changes mean savings of up to \u00a35,000 for first-time buyers. Labour said cutting stamp duty just drove up house prices.\n\nWhere can you afford to live?

He's scored 14 goals this season - you need someone like that in this team. It seems like it's derailed what's going on.\"\n\nWhen asked if a move to China would surprise him, Wright said: \"Absolutely not. Costa doesn't seem like the sort of person who cares what people think. Whatever happens - if it's his back it's very hard to detect - something has turned him.\"\n\nItalian Conte, 47, was repeatedly questioned about the rumours surrounding the player after watching his side move seven points clear at the top of the table.\n\nAsked whether Costa has a future at Stamford Bridge, he said: \"I can't be concerned about this because today my players produced a great performance and showed spirit. I can't be concerned with nothing.\"\n\nThe former Juventus and Italy boss was then asked once more whether the Brazil-born forward would feature again for the Blues and responded with: \"Why not?\"\n\nHe added: \"There are lot of 'if' questions - I don't like to answer these types of questions.\"\n\nOn reports of interest from China, Conte told BBC Sport: \"I don't know and the club doesn't know anything about the reports of Costa to China. The truth is what I told you before.\"\n\nLeft-back Marcos Alonso, who scored twice against Leicester, said: \"You guys [journalists] made up the story. Diego wasn't feeling well because of his back. He's very happy and will have a great season at Chelsea.\"\n\nAnalysis: 'If you get \u00a360m, then let him go'\n\nWhy shouldn't Diego Costa go to China? There is no loyalty from clubs in football.\n\nHe's already defected from Brazil, his native country, to play for Spain and has no real affinity with England and the Premier League. I'm sure he likes London but he doesn't have any real affinity here.\n\nBrazilians move around all the time; they will go wherever the money is.\n\u2022 None Hear more from Mills on BBC Radio 5 live\n\nWell done Conte. If you get \u00a360m, then let him go.\n\nHe's at his peak, the team is built around him totally. He is a top, top player, but if he wants to go to China and be bored 18 hours a day, good luck to him. If he went - and I don't think he will - they don't win the league.\n\nConte is reasserting himself. Costa has football utopia at the moment - top of the league, top of the scoring charts, what is wrong in his life? He will come back quietly with an apology.\n\nI don't think it will derail Chelsea.

One of the officers received minor injuries to his neck.\n\nMr Trump scorned as \"fake news\" claims that Russia holds compromising material about his private life\n\nEvery Russian knows what \"kompromat\" means. Now, thanks to a graphic section of the unverified intelligence dossier on Donald Trump, the rest of the world does, too.\n\nSince the allegations were made public, the US president-elect has denied claims that he cavorted in Russia with prostitutes - and Russian officials have denied claims that they filmed it.\n\nThis week, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin told me that \"the Kremlin does not collect kompromat\".\n\nBut someone in Russia clearly does. And the sensational results periodically surface, either via the compliant state media or via the internet.\n\nLast spring was a case in point.\n\nA state-controlled TV channel, NTV, ran footage of former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in bed with his personal assistant, Natalia Pelevina. Not only was the material cringe-worthily intimate, it also revealed the couple bad-mouthing other members of Russia's notoriously divided opposition.\n\nThe tape helped divide them even further.\n\n\"It was shot inside a private apartment by the [Russian security service] FSB, there is no doubt about it,\" Ms Pelevina told the BBC, referring to what happened as an \"obvious smear campaign\".\n\nGrainy video footage showed Mr Kasyanov with his personal assistant in a bedroom\n\nThere is no evidence that America's president-elect was ever caught in a similar way. But Ms Pelevina argues that her own experience suggests that such an idea is not implausible.\n\n\"I would not rule out that the Russian FSB has something against Donald Trump. Because they collect those materials not just against enemies; they collect against so-called friends. Just in case it will come in handy one day,\" she said.\n\nSome argue that the FSB had no reason to ensnare Mr Trump before his presidential ambitions were public.\n\n\"What would have been the point?\" Frederick Forsyth, a spy author who worked for MI6 for 20 years, asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.\n\n\"I don't think there's any indication that the man who was host of the game show Apprentice and builder of hotels was ever going to be anything important in the political world,\" he said.\n\nBut a former Russian intelligence agent dismissed that logic.\n\n\"Donald Trump was never just anyone. He was always a well-known businessman, not just a tourist,\" the former operative, who asked not to be named, pointed out.\n\n\"You call it 'kompromat', but it's just information. Everyone does it. You British gathered it on [Mikhail] Gorbachev, we gathered it on [Margaret] Thatcher. So theoretically, yes, it's possible,\" he said.\n\nIf Russian agents did gather such information, he said, then it would be no surprise that it got out.\n\n\"You can't be surprised by anything anymore, after Edward Snowden and after Wikileaks,\" the ex-agent said.\n\nThat is one reason why many Russians are unfazed by the allegations. Another is that they have seen it all before.\n\nThe most notorious victim of kompromat was Yury Skur", "the continuing importance of the special relationship\n\nPresident Trump needs to demonstrate that he has the seriousness to be the leader of the West and that he has command of the issues. The American audience will be watching.\n\nTheresa May needs to tread carefully. There is much she needs from America, not least a trade agreement, but many in the UK would question deepening a \"special\" relationship with a president they intensely distrust.\n\nThe prime minister has promised to be \"frank\" in her discussions, but Britain outside the EU needs a close ally in Washington and Donald Trump is likely to get his invitation to visit Britain and stay in Buckingham Palace and risk the demonstrations such a visit may spark.\n\nFor the UK, trade is the centrepiece of the visit.\n\nWith the UK leaving the EU and its single market, Britain will need new trading relationships. Already trade between Britain and the US is worth \u00a3150bn ($188bn). What the prime minister is looking for is a \"bold and ambitious free-trade agreement\" with the US.\n\nSuch a trade deal cannot be concluded while the UK remains part of the EU but preparatory work can begin so that a trade agreement can be in place shortly after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.\n\nThe prime minister is a strong advocate of free trade versus protectionism\n\nThere will be discussions about reducing existing tariffs and making it easier for American and British citizens to work in each other's countries.\n\nProgress surely will be made but there are deep underlying differences. The president's core policy is \"America First\". Theresa May's slogan is \"Global Britain\". Donald Trump has spent this week signalling he is pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and bent on re-negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nBritain outside the EU, on the other hand, needs an open global trading system. Theresa May has to be an advocate for free trade in the house of a leader determined to protect first and trade second.\n\nDowning Street will also know that a deal with the US will strengthen its hand in its negotiations with Brussels.\n\nDuring the election campaign Donald Trump caused consternation in Europe and in the foreign policy establishment in Washington when he declared Nato \"obsolete\".\n\nOn one level it was an expression of American frustration that its European allies refused to share the burden of defence. Theresa May will surely support the president in calling on Europe to spend 2% of GDP on its military.\n\nThere are calls for more Nato countries to share the alliance's financial burden\n\nBut May will be looking for much more. She wants to hear the President commit to Nato's Article Five, that an attack on one member will be treated as an attack on all.\n\nFor her, Nato is part of the post-war international order. Britain outside the EU needs Nato more than ever. In the future it will be Nato that will be the UK's link to its European neighbours.\n\nOne of the ironies of the visit is that Theresa May will fight for the EU. It will be a case of a divorcee speaking up for a former partner.\n\nEurope has been shocked by Donald Trump's comments about Europe breaking up, about the EU being a \"vehicle for Germany\". For the first time since the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago, Europe does not have a friend in the White House who shares the mission and belief in European integration.\n\nSo Theresa May has an opportunity to win friends in Europe's capitals by standing up for the EU. It is not in Britain's interest, as she has said, for the European Union to unravel. \"It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain's national interest that the EU should succeed,\" she believes.\n\nDespite Brexit, Mrs May could speak up for the European Union\n\nA global Britain needs a strong international order and part of that is Nato, the EU, and open trade. In the past it has been the US underpinning this global order. Theresa May will need to be the great persuader.\n\nThe UK views Moscow and Putin differently from the new administration in Washington. Donald Trump has signalled that he can open a new era with Russia.\n\nThe UK remains deeply suspicious of the Kremlin. It is not just a question as to whether sanctions should be retained against Russia for its military actions in Crimea and Ukraine.\n\nThe UK and US have the strongest intelligence-sharing relationship in the world. The UK will want reassurance that any tilt towards Russia does not compromise its intelligence assets.\n\nRegarding the Middle East, Donald Trump has made it clear that Israel will have his full support. Already, Israel has taken heart from its new friend in the White House by announcing the building of new settlements in the West Bank. Donald Trump has suggested he may move the US embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nTheresa May's words will be scrutinised closely. In seeking a close relationship with Donald Trump, will there be any change in emphasis in supporting a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians?\n\nDowning Street will seek reassurance over the effects of closer ties between the US and Russia\n\nThe British prime minister will also want to talk about energy and her commitment to the Paris agreement on reducing global warming.\n\nIn the end it is in both Britain and America's interest to forge a close relationship. Theresa May has spoken of \"renewing our nation's ties\".\n\nOutside the EU, the UK needs the American embrace. The Trump administration brings opportunities. Donald Trump remains an enthusiast for Brexit. He wants Brexit to succeed and has promised to give his backing to a trade deal.\n\nBut many of his policies are opposed by Theresa May and many British voters. She cannot risk getting too close to a man despised by many in the UK.\n\nHer priority will be trade but what she wants from the 45th president is a commitment to supporting the post-war international order without pulling away at the threads that bind it.\n\nOn a personal level they are unlikely allies, but self-interest may yet rekindle the Reagan-Thatcher alliance.\n\nTheresa May is preparing to meet new US President Donald Trump.

Everton will complain it was a soft award - as Liverpool did when Dejan Lovren was punished with a penalty when he manhandled Calvert-Lewin in the recent 1-1 draw at Anfield - but once the Toffees defender laid hands on his opponent he was asking for trouble.\n\nThe biggest flashpoint came moments later when Holgate had a rush of blood to the head and shoved Firmino into the crowd. The incident boiled over as the Brazilian rushed back at Holgate to protest - angry words were exchanged and Everton's youngster reacted with undisguised fury to something Firmino said.\n\nAfter that, Madley was able to keep a check on the emotions as a game that was passionate never threatened to get out of hand.\n\nWith interesting timing, Everton announced the completion of the \u00a327m deal for Besiktas striker Tosun during the half-time interval.\n\nAnd while their display was a vast improvement on the attritional effort in the recent draw at Anfield, it is clear the Toffees need the sort of spearhead Allardyce hopes Tosun will provide.\n\nThe visitors at least carried some threat here via the pace and width of Yannick Bolasie and substitute Ademola Lookman, but they require the sort of finishing power that has been missing with the failure to replace Romelu Lukaku.\n\nAnd one final note on Everton: keeper Pickford will take responsibility for the winner but it should also be remembered he has been magnificent so far in what has been a very difficult season at Goodison Park.\n\nMore Merseyside derby success for Liverpool - the stats\n\u2022 None Liverpool are now unbeaten in 16 matches against Everton (won eight, drew eight) - their longest ever unbeaten run against them.\n\u2022 None Everton were unbeaten in their first seven matches under Allardyce (won four, drew three) but they have lost their past three, scoring just two goals in their past five matches.\n\u2022 None Milner has scored 11 of his 13 penalties for Liverpool - though he had failed to score with his previous two efforts before Friday.\n\u2022 None Milner has scored three goals in his past two FA Cup third-round matches, also scoring twice for Manchester City against Sheffield Wednesday in January 2015.\n\u2022 None All four of Sigurdsson's goals against Liverpool have been scored at Anfield, with two in the FA Cup.\n\u2022 None The Reds have not lost a Merseyside derby in which they have scored first since December 1992.\n\u2022 None This was the 24th meeting between these sides in the FA Cup, making it the most-played fixture in the competition's history.\n\n'Not a penalty' - what they said\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: \"It was not the best piece of football for 95 minutes, but a proper fight.

Some are staying away at the moment but we want them back.\n\n\"I can't ask them to come, as it's so expensive. But we need every penny we can in the transfer market.

I know how hard Roger's worked and how professional and meticulous he is about his preparations.\n\n\"It is a challenge, but great players love challenges. I expect great things because he's a great player.\"\n\nFederer, who has spent 302 weeks as world number one, has fallen to 16th in the rankings, his lowest position since May 2001.\n\nThat means he could face Britain's world number one Sir Andy Murray or defending champion Novak Djokovic as early as the fourth round of the Australian Open, which starts on 16 January.\n\nHaving reached the semi-finals in Melbourne last year, an early exit would further impact on his ranking.\n\nAnnacone feels that will not matter to Federer at this stage of his career, citing the example of Sampras, who won the US Open in 2002 as the 17th seed.\n\n\"It's not ideal but I'm a glass half-full guy,\" said the 53-year-old. \"I would imagine if you talked to Andy or Novak they're not going to want to be playing Roger in the round of 16 or third round either.\n\n\"I was with Pete Sampras when he won his 2002 US Open. He hadn't won an event for 26 months. With these great players, you just don't know what they're capable of. The rules don't apply - they're merely suggestions.\n\n\"I remember it with Pete. He said: 'I really don't care what my ranking is, it doesn't matter any more. It's about can I put myself in position to win tournaments, and in particular major tournaments.' I'm sure Roger's approaching it the same way.\"\n\nAs if to underline that, Federer said on Friday: \"Winning titles is a beautiful feeling; rankings at the moment... completely secondary. As long as I'm healthy, I think I can really do some damage.\"\n\nCan he make more history?\n\nFederer, who has won more Grand Slams than any other male player, will be 36 in August, and Annacone says he does not need to chase history for motivation.\n\n\"I just think the sheer joy of competing and the challenge of testing himself against the others will be enough for Roger,\" he said. \"He's so at peace with what he's done and where he is that he'll do it organically by himself.\n\n\"If he stays healthy and is able to train and compete as often as he's planning to then I would consider that a success.\n\n\"If he does that, his average level, for how talented he is, is going to be somewhere in the top 10 anyway. If that's the case, that average level will create opportunities where he is playing at the end of events.\"\n\nAnnacone, who keeps in touch with Federer \"via texts and instant messaging\", says the Swiss has been \"in good spirits\".\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago he was doing great, he was really happy in his training in Dubai,\" he said. \"His body felt good and he was really excited about 2017.\"\n\nBut Annacone, who will be commentating on the Australian Open for Tennis Channel, says Federer must \"stay patient\" in the early stages of his comeback.\n\n\"He is so meticulous in his preparation that I expect him to play pretty terrific tennis pretty quickly,\" he added.\n\n\"Now can he do it second event in, the Australian Open, for seven matches?

with their four previous victories over Premier League opposition in the Carabao Cup giving them a taste of what they hope is to come.\n\nGuardiola has previously used this competition to rest and rotate a number of his star players, but he picked a near full-strength side for the second leg, making just two changes to the team that beat Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nHis selection was tribute to the way Bristol City had performed at the Etihad a fortnight ago, impressing many with their adventure and attacking intent.\n\nThere would be no such repeat at Ashton Gate, however, with the away side taking complete control almost from the very first whistle.\n\nAguero's cross clipped the bar and David Silva's low shot had to be palmed away even before Sane's opener - and once Manchester City were able to add a ruthless streak to their overall dominance it was always going to be a big ask for the home team.\n\nDespite the impressive late rally, culminating in makeshift striker Flint stabbing in for 2-2, the visitors were still more than good value for their victory across both legs.\n\nThey had 68% possession and finished Tuesday's game with 28 shots on goal, scoring from three of the six they got on target.\n\nCan Man City do the quadruple?\n\nGuardiola is now just one game from winning his first silverware with Manchester City, having endured only the second barren season of his managerial career in 2016-17.\n\nThe 47-year-old Spaniard, who won 14 trophies in four years as Barcelona boss and a further seven in three years at Bayern Munich, is hoping to lead City to an unprecedented quadruple.\n\nHe has repeatedly played down his team's chances of achieving that feat, yet they continue to fight strongly on all fronts - already 12 points clear in the Premier League, they have also reached the last 16 of the Champions League and the fourth round of the FA Cup.\n\nDomestically, only Liverpool have found a way to beat them so far this season, meaning the one apparent remaining question mark is over whether they can translate their league and cup form into European competition.\n\nIf they are able to progress beyond FC Basel and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, even at this early stage they may seldom have a better opportunity of sealing a clean sweep of league and cups.\n\nA step too far for brave Bristol City\n\nLee Johnson and his players earned plenty of plaudits after their first-leg defeat, with Guardiola describing Bristol City as a \"fantastic team\" and lauding their style of play and attacking intent as \"good for the show\".\n\nDespite trailing on aggregate throughout the second leg, the fact they became only the second team since October to score twice in a domestic match against Manchester City spoke volumes of both their quality and spirit.\n\nThe Robins had already seen off top-flight sides Watford, Crystal Palace, Stoke City and famously Manchester United on their way to the last four - though two legs against the runaway Premier League leaders was always going to be a tall order.\n\nFollowing a tentative opening period, during which they were pinned back for long spells, they looked much more of a threat with the half-time arrival of \u00a35.3m summer signing Famara Diedhiou.\n\nHead coach Johnson will now hope the return of Diedhiou, who has missed the past three months with a knee injury, can also inspire his side towards achieving the ultimate goal of securing top-flight football for the first time since 1980.\n\nWhat they said:\n\nBristol City boss Lee Johnson: \"We came close to a draw. They are a top, top side, probably the best side I've seen live.\n\n\"They have so many players that are intricate and have class on the ball and sometimes you have to hold your hands up and say 'they are a better side than us'.\n\n\"But the spirit we showed, we never gave in and we continued to try and attack and scored two goals and not many teams can score two goals against a side like that.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: \"We are so happy to be there, to reach this final.

It is said to be able to carry up to 400lb (181kg).\n\nWorkhorse told the BBC: \"The SureFly is a purpose-built experimental aircraft and the fuselage on the SureFly at CES has not been waterproofed, although it will be on future production models.\n\n\"To avoid potential risks associated with rain affecting the aircraft\u2019s electrical system and the SureFly\u2019s rotor blades, the SureFly\u2019s first flight has been postponed.\"\n\nPatrick Miller, from Unmanned Aerial Systems Magazine, said such delays were not unusual and that the company was wise to avoid any remote risk of a malfunction.\n\n\"With an unmanned aircraft designed to carry a person,\" he said, \"why risk negative publicity by flying in rainy weather?\"\n\nWorkhorse said it hoped to carry out the maiden flight soon.\n\u2022 None First look at coolest tech of CES 2018\n\nMr Mundell had previously told MSPs the amendments would be introduced in the Commons\n\nPromised changes to the UK government's EU Withdrawal Bill that would reflect concerns over its impact on devolution will be delayed, it has been confirmed.\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell told MPs last month that the amendments would happen during next week's report stage in the House of Commons.\n\nHowever, he has now said the changes will not happen until the bill reaches the House of Lords.\n\nHe also said the government remained committed to improving the bill.\n\nGovernment sources said that the resignation of Damian Green - who had been leading talks with the devolved administrations - from his Cabinet Office post, coupled with the festive break, had caused the timetable to slip.\n\nThe Scottish government has previously said it would not put the legislation to a consent vote in the Scottish Parliament unless changes are made.\n\nMr Mundell said: \"I can confirm today that amendments to clause 11 of the bill will be brought forward in the House of Lords, allowing for further discussions to take place between the UK government and Scottish government.\n\n\"A substantial number of powers will transfer direct to the Scottish Parliament. The two governments agree that in some areas common frameworks will be required.\n\n\"I regret that it has not been possible to bring forward amendments at the report stage but our commitment to improve the bill remains absolute. The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides, and talks between Scotland's two governments will continue.\"\n\nA series of summits between ministers from around the UK have failed to resolve the impasse over post-Brexit powers\n\nHe added: \"I remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish Parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation.\n\n\"The two governments have made good progress on how powers should be brought back from Brussels, including through the JMC(EN) meetings, and expect to make further progress in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nThe Scottish government's Brexit minister, Mike Russell, told Holyrood that the UK government's failure to introduce the amendments in the House of Commons was \"very regrettable\" and \"unacceptable\", but said that talks over the bill would continue.\n\nHe added: \"We have spent six months discussing bringing forward this amendment, and no amendment has been brought forward.\"\n\nLots of frustration at the announcement tonight there won't be changes to the Withdrawal Bill next week.\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell had promise amendments to reflect concerns over the impact the bill will have on devolution at report stage. But today he confirmed that's not happening now; there's been no agreement with Edinburgh and ministers in London don't want to bring the changes until that happens.\n\nMy sources say the departure of Damian Green - who had chaired high-level meetings with the Scottish government on this - didn't help. Nor did the fact the next parliamentary stage of the bill is happening a bit earlier than most expected.\n\nIt doesn't mean changes won't happen. The government says it's still committed to amendments, but they'll happen in the Lords instead.\n\nBut the Scottish Tories aren't happy. This morning, Tory MPs were still expecting the changes next week. I've heard the words \"frustrated\" and \"disappointed\" from a few. They're meeting tonight as a group to discuss the next steps.\n\nThe SNP are furious because it means MPs won't get to scrutinise the changes. Labour are too; they say it shows contempt for democracy.\n\nThe Scottish Tories will, I believe, ultimately be happy as long as the changes do happen in the Lords. But tonight there are a lot of angry faces across the parties.\n\nScottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said he too was \"deeply frustrated and disappointed\" that the amendments had not been made yet, and that he had been led to believe the bill would have been changed by now.\n\nHe also said it was \"imperative\" the legislation was passed at Westminster with the Scottish Parliament's consent.\n\nThe UK and Scottish governments are locked in a dispute over what will happen to powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels.\n\nUK ministers want them all returned to Westminster in the first instance, before some are devolved and some woven into UK-wide frameworks - but Scottish and Welsh ministers term this a \"power grab\".\n\nIn a report published on Tuesday, Holyrood's constitution committee - which includes Conservative MSPs - backed the Scottish government's stance, and said the bill was currently \"incompatible with devolution\".\n\nThe argument over the EU Withdrawal Bill focuses on Clause 11, which deals directly with the devolved administrations and the powers coming back from Brussels post-Brexit.\n\nThe clause has been attacked by groups including the Scottish government, SNP MPs at Westminster and even Scottish Conservative MPs, one of whom described it as \"not fit for purpose\".\n\nMSPs on the constitution committee unanimously added their weight to this, saying that \"Clause 11, as currently drafted, is incompatible with the devolution settlement in Scotland\".\n\nThey said the committee \"will not be in a position to recommend legislative consent for the bill unless Clause 11 is replaced or removed\", adding that resolving this should be \"a matter of priority\" for the UK government.\n\nCommittee convener Bruce Crawford said that in its present form, the bill \"represents a fundamental shift in the structure of devolution in Scotland\".\n\nOpposition party leaders met at Westminster to talks about Brexit on Tuesday morning - with an empty chair for Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBut Mr Tomkins, the deputy convener of the committee, welcomed the \"progress that has been made\" in \"developing an approach to agreeing common UK frameworks\" for returning powers.\n\nAnd he said members \"welcome the UK government's commitment to respect the devolution settlement\".\n\nScottish Brexit minister Mike Russell - who welcomed the committee's report - has said the government is looking at the possibility of introducing its own \"continuity\" legislation, should it fail to come to an agreement over the UK bill.\n\nThe committee said this approach would result in \"a reduced timetable for parliamentary scrutiny\", urging the government to engage in \"early discussions\" with the parliament about this.\n\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments jointly put forward potential amendments to the Withdrawal Bill during the early part of its progress through Westminster, but saw them rejected by MPs.\n\nHowever, Mr Mundell told MPs on 6 December that \"the bill will be amended\", later clarifying that this would \"happen on report\".\n\nMeanwhile, MSPs have been debating the Brexit process and the position of the remaining EU member states on their first day back after the festive recess.\n\nThey discussed evidence gathered by the culture, tourism, Europe and external relations committee on the Brexit process, which began with the triggering of Article 50 in March 2016.\n\n", "has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What the world thinks of Trump\n\nAt the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment.\n\nMr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased.\n\nThe total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years.\n\nSome of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US.\n\nAnother survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign.\n\nThere were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap.\n\nMr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line.\n\nMaking waves? Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades.\n\nIn a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers.\n\n\"For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,\" the president said. \"But all that changed the day I took the oath of office.\"\n\nWhile it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues.\n\nShortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception).\n\nThe government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances.\n\nMr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history.\n\nOn 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory.\n\nMaking waves? President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down.\n\nMr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark.\n\nUnemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015.\n\nThe hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, a small-business confidence index hit the highest level in its 45-year history.\n\nOf course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge.\n\nIn a recent Quinnipiac survey that showed 66% of the public believes the economy is \"excellent or good\", 49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump.\n\nMaking waves? The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an \"America First\" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action.\n\nThe president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements\n\nMr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him \"little rocket man\" and saying his nation would be met with \"fire and fury\" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric.\n\nThe most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa.\n\nIn Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants.\n\nMr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community.\n\nWith great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed.\n\nMaking waves? Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some\n\nThere's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump.\n\nNo one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage.\n\nFor many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke.\n\nThey asked for different, and different is what they got.\n\nMr Trump has said", "be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained within the EU's single market and customs union.\n\n\"If that's the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn't worry about it,\" Lord O'Neill said ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where there are likely to be a number of positive growth upgrades published for the global economy.\n\n\"Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we'll probably suffer more than that 3%.\n\n\"But if it is only 3%, what's going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily.\"\n\nLord O'Neill said it was ironic that Britain was leaving the EU at just the time growth was increasing across the continent, given that one of the arguments for leaving was unshackling the UK from a number of \"sclerotic\" European economies.\n\nBetter global growth helps UK exports - an important driver of the British economy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. UK economy will do better than expected, says Lord Jim O'Neill, a former minister and a Remain supporter\n\nI asked him whether his optimistic forecasts now revealed that he, and many economists, had simply been too pessimistic about the effects of a Brexit vote.\n\n\"I'm almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that,\" Lord O'Neill replied.\n\n\"Because of course, in principle, I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective.\n\n\"And maybe this [better global growth] means the country's going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago.\n\n\"But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn't the most important thing facing Britain's future.\"\n\nHe said that global growth, better productivity and rebalancing government policies to support the north of England and other regions beyond London was much more important.\n\nThere was some evidence, Lord O'Neill argued, that was now happening.\n\nHe said that the \"Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream. They're like 'there you go, told you so', which of course is ridiculous\".\n\nLord O'Neill said that major sectors of the economy that are closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats because of the government's proposals to leave the customs union and the single market.\n\nChina's economy has been buoyant in recent months\n\nOver the past six months economic forecasts have become more bullish on world growth. China, the US and Germany have all published strong economic data and last autumn the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global predictions.\n\n\"I'm guessing world GDP growth of at least 4%, so a good half percent higher than the consensus is currently saying - and signs of it actually accelerating,\" Lord O'Neill said.\n\n\"Virtually every major place I can think of, [with the] possible exception of us, are all sharing in it at the same time. World trade - just when everybody's trying to write it off - has actually risen sharply.\"\n\nHe said that President Donald Trump's reforms of the tax system and plans to loosen regulatory controls would boost the US economy.\n\n\"The secular stagnation that the likes of Larry Summers [the former US Treasury Secretary] have talked about for a few years looks suspiciously dodgy. I would imagine that the idea is going to be back tracked pretty quickly now.\"\n\nTokyo has carried out an evacuation drill amidst fears of a missile attack from North Korea.\n\nVolunteers were evacuated from a fair ground and a park and then took cover in subway stations and underground spaces.\n\nA couple have said they are \"heartbroken\" after losing a third child to a rare heart condition.\n\nIt follows the death of his sister Charlotte, 16, in 2010 and 17-year-old brother Craig in 2013.\n\nParents Robert and Maggie Underwood say they felt \"numb\" after their loss, but would continue fundraising for equipment that could help prevent future deaths.\n\nThe couple have been calling for defibrillators in schools since losing Charlotte.\n\nAt the time, her death was put down to Sudden Arrythmia Death Syndrome (Sads).\n\nCharlotte Prentice-Underwood was 16 when she died in December 2010\n\nBut when Craig died, he underwent tests which showed he had Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes heart problems.\n\nThey now believe that may also have been the cause of Charlotte's death.\n\nTheir older children including Carrick, Christopher, 25, Caroline, 24, and Cameron, 17, had tests which showed they had the same genetic condition.\n\nMr Underwood said they would now be pushing for tests for their younger children, five-year-old Poppy and Mitchell, seven.\n\nHe added: \"We're just numb, angry, upset.\"\n\nThey informed people of Carrick's death in the Charlotte and Craig Saving Hearts Foundation Facebook group.\n\nThe couple said: \"We are heartbroken, numb and totally lost.\"\n\nThey have received hundreds of messages of support online since the announcement.\n\nCraig Prentice-Underwood died almost exactly three years after the death of his sister, aged 17\n\nTwo days after Carrick's death, the couple and son Mitchell were out fundraising in Sainsbury's, Redditch, in his memory.\n\nMr Underwood said: \"We are the Sainsbury's charity of the year and we have had a couple of dates set up.\n\n\"When it came to it, we thought about cancelling but we asked Mitchell what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to go fundraising for Carrick and the charity.\n\n\"It broke our hearts, but he wanted to do it.\n\n\"It was hard, but a lot of people came up and showed us support and it was really needed.

Talks had previously stalled over how the purse would be split but a compromise was reached last month which will see Parker, 25, earn 30-35%.\n\nParker is undefeated in his 24 professional fights, with 18 of those wins coming by a knockout.\n\n\"Anthony Joshua is in for a huge shock,\" Parker said. \"A couple of months ago I heard him say: 'Why should I be worried about this little kid from New Zealand?'\n\n\"Well, now he's about to find out.

But why do these shortages persist and is there anything that can be done to get rid of them?\n\nIn this week's In Business on BBC Radio 4, I spoke to historians, economists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare staff to try to get to the bottom of these questions.\n\nAnd to pose another one - does the NHS have the right mix of staff with the right mix of skills or could changing traditional roles rather than just boosting numbers help?\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing says England is currently short of at least 20,000 nursing staff.\n\nAnd the Royal College of Midwives says the country needs 3,500 more midwives.\n\nMeanwhile, GP leaders and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine say the UK urgently needs greater numbers of general practitioners and emergency doctors - just a few of the medical specialities struggling with recruitment and retention right now.\n\nIncreasingly, an older population, with often complex health needs, adds extra demand.\n\nBut these problems are far from new.\n\nStephanie Snow, medical historian at the University of Manchester, says staff shortages have existed since the very birth of the NHS, in 1948 - though people are often quick to label recruitment crises as one-off problems.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"Over the first decade in particular, the NHS expanded its specialist services rapidly and there were many new technologies on board.\n\n\"All of these things led to unprecedented increases in the number of staff required.\n\n\"By the time we get to the late 1960s, hospitals had to turn to mass recruitment, looking towards countries such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - where courses were taught in English and aligned to the UK's General Medical Council, as a consequence of colonial rule.\"\n\nPhysician associates are a relatively new role within the NHS\n\nMeanwhile, Anita Charlesworth, director of Research and Economics at the think tank, the Health Foundation, argues the UK has perpetually trained lower numbers of medical and nursing students than it needs.\n\nShe said: \"There is not a problem that we don't have enough bright, young people who would meet the standards and would love to have a career in medicine and nursing.\n\n\"They just can't get a place. We have systematically trained fewer than we need.\"\n\nAnd she suggests being able to recruit doctors and nurses from overseas has offered a \"get out of jail card\" for successive staff shortages.\n\nDr Mark Porter, of the doctors' union, the British Medical Association, argues we have generally staffed a health service we can afford - rather than look at what the population needs.\n\nBut he says planning for the NHS workforce of the future is not easy.\n\nHe said: \"It is difficult to get planning perfect for every one of 50 or 60 specialities all of the time.\n\n\"The population's needs are genuinely not quite as predictable as one might imagine.\n\n\"We know the trajectory illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are taking over the next five years.\n\n\"But what about the next 25 years?\n\n\"Will public health messages and new technology be successful, or won't they?\n\n\"The answer could give us completely different trajectories in the future.\"\n\nNurses starting work on the first day of the NHS\n\nFor its part, the government says it plans to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses it trains and boost other healthcare staff too.\n\nAt the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said: \"My job is to prepare the NHS for the future, and that means doing something today that we have never done properly before, and that's training enough doctors.\"\n\nThe government announced there would be up to an extra 1,500 medical school places each year from 2018 in England.\n\nAnd, looking back, the NHS Confederation said there had been an extra 32,467 doctors employed in England in 2014 compared with 2004.\n\nHealth chiefs also say current plans to scrap nurse bursaries will help increase the number of nurse training places available this year - though whether this will work in practice is unclear and has been disputed by nursing leaders.\n\nOther positions such as nurse apprentices and physician associates are being explored.\n\nPhysician associates (PAs) - trained to do some of the jobs junior doctors do, might be able to cut some pressures on wards.\n\nBut current numbers are tiny, most cannot prescribe and they are not professionally regulated in the same way doctors are.\n\nMs Charlesworth is worried options for filling shortages quickly might be running out.\n\nShe said: \"There's a massive gap globally now in the number of doctors and nurses compared to projected demand.\n\n\"So India keeps many more of its doctors.\n\n\"It has fantastic leading hospitals that are an exciting place to work if you are a young Indian doctor.\n\n\"There is a global shortage of clinical healthcare staff.\"\n\nAnd of course there is another issue to consider.\n\nIt is estimated about 10% doctors and 7% of nurses working in the NHS in England are nationals of other EU countries.\n\nThe question is -

Footage of car on fire in Londonderry\n\nA bomb has exploded inside a car outside the courthouse in Londonderry.\n\nThe explosion occurred in Bishop Street at about 20:15 GMT on Saturday, shortly after police received a warning.\n\nOfficers were on the scene when the blast occurred. No one is believed to have been injured.\n\nPolice had just started evacuating nearby buildings, including a hotel, when the explosion took place. A cordon remains in place at the scene.\n\nLocal politicians have told the BBC that the vehicle was hijacked in Derry some time before the explosion.\n\nAn eyewitness told the BBC: \"The remains of the car could still be seen burning in the middle of the road.\n\n\"A cordon has been set up around the scene and police are evacuating more buildings on Bishop Street.\"\n\nThe cordon remained in place on Sunday morning as officers inspect the scene\n\nIn a statement issued on Facebook, the PSNI said: \"As far as we know no one [is] injured.\"\n\nHowever, they said that there is another car they \"are not happy about\" and are evacuating the area and advising residents in the area to make preparations to leave.\n\nGreg McLaughlin, who lives nearby, said his windows shook with the force of the blast.\n\n\"It was very, very loud. I knew right away this was a bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"We knew it was quite close.\n\n\"You could see the ball of fire on the street. It sounded to me like a very significant blast. I haven't heard anything like it in Derry for quite a while.\"\n\nBusinesses and other properties have been evacuated and the cordon on Bishop Street has been extended.\n\nOne business owner said she heard a bang and was lucky to be inside at the time. She said she could have been on the street minutes later.\n\nThe PSNI has asked members of the public to stay away.\n\nColin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the explosion had caused major disruption in the Bishop Street area of the city.\n\n\"This has to be condemned in its strongest terms, taking place on a Saturday evening when many people are out enjoying themselves.\n\n\"The loss of trade for the local hospitality sector and the impact that this will have on tourism and the local economy benefits no one.\"\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was concerned at the reports coming from Londonderry and was \"being kept informed by PSNI\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MP Elisha McCallion said the incident had \"shocked the local community\".\n\n\"In particular, there are many elderly residents who live in the area who have been alarmed by this incident,\" she said.\n\nSDLP MLA Mark H Durkan tweeted: \"Whoever is responsible for this explosion outside Bishop Street Courthouse in Derry clearly hasn't got the message that the people of Derry DO NOT want this on our streets.\"\n\nThe DUP MLA, Gary Middleton, described the incident as a \"disgraceful act of terrorism\".\n\nHis party leader Arlene Foster tweeted: \"This pointless act of terror must be condemned in the strongest terms. Only hurts the people of the city.\n\n\"Perpetrated by people with no regard for life. Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries.\"\n\n\"There is no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHow long do you wait to see your GP?\n\nMembers of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group report waits of three weeks or more are common.\n\nLisa Johns said: \"Ours book five weeks ahead. For the last three weeks, I've been trying to book a standard appointment and can't get one, as they go in seconds.\"\n\nAnother member posted: \"I booked a non-urgent appointment with my GP last week.... for 22 January 2019.\"\n\nTheir experiences are backed up by statistics.\n\nEarlier this month, NHS Digital published figures showing that, while 40% of patients were seen on the day they booked, just under a fifth waited longer than a fortnight for a routine appointment with a GP or practice nurse.\n\nBut what's the story behind these figures?\n\nHave waits actually got longer?\n\nThe NHS Digital figures show of 307 million appointments booked at practices in England between November 2017 and October 2018:\n\nIt is the first time such figures has been published - so there aren't similar figures to compare them with. But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop.\"\n\nBut the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability.\n\n\"We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,\" an RCGP official said.\n\nIs it safe to wait weeks for an appointment?\n\nSome patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of", "two huge personalities straight from the top tier of management - and it brought a victory for Jurgen Klopp to cherish at Pep Guardiola's expense.\n\nThe head-to-head was locked at 4-4 after their meetings in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. This was a different stage with different prizes on offer - but it was an occasion that was just as charged.\n\nKlopp, in 15 months, has revitalised Liverpool and given hope to supporters longing to end the wait for a first title since 1990. And as they continue their pursuit of relentless Chelsea, belief continues to grow that the charismatic German can still haul in Antonio Conte's side.\n\nLiverpool's manager was, as usual, celebrating with his players after the final whistle before pumping his chest in mock relief in front of Anfield's huge new Main Stand.\n\nAnd, when City fleetingly threatened a second-half comeback, he turned cheerleader in front of those same fans with a demand to lift the noise levels that was met instantly.\n\nKlopp has become the new Anfield talisman. Under him, the transformation of his team and the mood around the club continues.\n\nSomething else that will give Liverpool's fans great heart is the way in which Klopp is getting results against his closest rivals.\n\nSince his appointment in October 2015, Klopp has faced a total of 13 Premier League games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. He has lost only one - a single goal defeat by United last season.\n\nHe has also enjoyed a Europa League win over two legs against United, although the balance is redressed slightly by a loss on penalties against Manchester City in last season's Capital One Cup final.\n\nLiverpool - and indeed Manchester City - are having to run to stand still in the Premier League title race, with Chelsea stretching their winning run to 13 games as they beat Stoke City earlier on Saturday.\n\nIt meant this was a game both sides needed to win - hence the contrasting emotions of Klopp and Guardiola at the final whistle.\n\nLiverpool are underdogs but six points is still a gap that can be closed and Chelsea have to visit Anfield on 31 January.\n\nKlopp's players have shown strength of character with their response to setbacks earlier this month, when they lost 4-3 at Bournemouth and drew 2-2 at home to West Ham.\n\nThey have also shown they can win in different ways. Recent victories over Middlesbrough and Stoke showcased a free-flowing style. At Everton and against City, they toughed it out - and answered questions about a supposedly vulnerable defence. It is evidence that Liverpool must be taken very seriously as title challengers.\n\nIt is far too early to dismiss a manager of Guardiola's ability - and a team of City's talents - in terms of the Premier League title race. However, the 10-point gap between themselves and Chelsea is starting to look as if it will only be overturned by extraordinary events.\n\nCity were too timid for too long here at Anfield. Sergio Aguero - returning after a four-match ban - was starved of service, while Kevin de Bruyne was marginalised and largely snuffed out by Liverpool's intense pressing style.\n\nIt was still David Silva who called the shots when they did put some moves together after the break but Yaya Toure could not exert serious influence.\n\nGuardiola's task should at least be put in context. City were a team short on inspiration and spark for much of last season under Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps it was too much to expect even a manager of Guardiola's pedigree to apply an instant fix.\n\nCity should never be ruled out. But on the evidence of this flat performance - and the growing sense that significant renewal of the squad is still needed - dragging back Chelsea may be beyond them for this season.\n\n'I don't care about criticism' - what they said\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I know everyone talks about our defence. It's not about avoiding goals - that's the end product - it's about how we work together.\n\n\"I think we have the smallest number of shots on our goal in the league. Tonight the concentration level was outstanding.\n\n\"I don't care about criticism of our defence. You always pick out things that aren't right but that's how goals are.\"\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was an equal game. The goal made it difficult against a team who use the counter-attack like a master. The second half was much better.\n\n\"We have to wake up for another game. We need to focus and work - we can't think about the big goals.\"\n\nFormer England defender Phil Neville: \"It was a poor game. I was so disappointed by how poorly Manchester City passed the ball. They didn't get back into shape quick enough.\n\n\"Aleksandar Kolarov should have been winning that header against Georginio Wijnaldum. They were really poor in possession and well off the pace. Full credit to Liverpool, they set up deeper and didn't let City have possession.\"\n\u2022 None Liverpool have won four consecutive league games against Manchester City for the first time since 1981 (when they managed a run of seven).\n\u2022 None Pep Guardiola has now suffered twice as many league defeats this season (four) as he did in the entire 2015-16 Bundesliga campaign with Bayern Munich (two).\n\u2022 None Manchester City have kept just four clean sheets in their 19 Premier League games under Guardiola.\n\u2022 None Liverpool have scored 87 league goals in 2016; their most in a calendar year since 1985 (also 87).\n\u2022 None Adam Lallana has made seven assists in the Premier League this season (in 17 appearances); his most in a single campaign.\n\u2022 None Lallana also ends 2016 having been involved in 21 goals in the Premier League (11 goals, 10 assists); no midfielder in the competition has had a hand in more.\n\nA swift turnaround.

And scientific research.\n\nStudies show that pubic hair grooming is becoming increasingly common.

fell 5.7% in the 18 weeks to 5 January.\n\nLike many High Street retailers Debenhams has been hit by a shift to online shopping and rising costs. Last year it issued three profit warnings. It is closing up to 50 of its stores and is seeking new finance.\n\nThe board said Mr Bucher was not re-elected to the board \"principally as a result of the votes of the same two major shareholders\" who voted against Sir Ian - that is, Sports Direct and Landmark Group.\n\nHowever it added: \"Of the votes cast... Sergio received 44.15% votes in favour of his re-election. Excluding those two shareholders, the vote for Sergio to continue on the board was approximately 99.6% in favour.\"\n\nDebenhams board said it was \"mindful of its responsibilities to all shareholders and has full confidence in Sergio and in the management's plan to boost the business.\n\nAs a result, it added, the board and Mr Bucher had agreed that he should continue as chief \"reporting to the board\".\n\nHowever, Sir Ian had \"concluded it is no longer possible for him to remain chairman of Debenhams,\" it said.\n\nSir Ian had been on the Debenhams board for two years.\n\nTerry Duddy, Debenhams' senior independent director, has been appointed interim chairman. He said: \"I recognise that individual shareholders have wished to register their dissatisfaction.\n\n\"I am looking forward to working with Sergio. My first task is to meet with shareholders so that I understand any concerns that they may have.\"\n\nMr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, has been taking an increased interest in Debenhams.\n\nSports Direct already owns nearly 30% of the shares in the department store chain and has offered a further \u00a340m investment. Debenhams rejected his offer, but said all options remain open.\n\nEarlier on Thursday Mr Bucher said there had been fewer customers visiting the company's stores.\n\nHe confirmed that Debenhams was in talks with its lenders about its \u00a3520m credit line. Those talks were \"constructive\", he said.\n\nThe Ose robot massager has been banned from CES\n\nA sex toy designed for women has been banned from the technology show CES.\n\nLora DiCarlo said it had been invited to display its robotic Ose vibrator at CES, after winning an innovation award.\n\nCES organiser the Consumer Technology Association, which granted the award, said it had included the device by mistake and could withdraw any immoral or obscene entry at any time.\n\nLora DiCarlo chief executive Lora Haddock said the CES and CTA had a history of gender bias.\n\nIn a statement to The Next Web, the CTA said: \"The product does not fit into any of our existing product categories and should not have been accepted.\n\n\"We have apologised to the company for our mistake.\"\n\nBut, in a statement on the Lora DiCarlo website, Ms Haddock", "build a culture of openness.\n\n\"I also had my own experiences of the menopause to draw on and I talked about it very candidly.\n\n\"There was me, at the top of an organisation making difficult decisions, and I didn't want anyone blaming those decisions on irrationality. It was quite a challenge to overcome.\"\n\nMs Newson works with West Midlands Police and the fire service to give advice and support on the menopause and its impact on work.\n\nShe said: \"Is enough being done to address it in the workplace? No. It's still a silent issue for too many organisations.\n\n\"We don't talk about the menopause. We don't get taught it at school and it's not standard to learn about it in medical training either.\"\n\nShe added: \"Things are improving but there needs to be much more openness and understanding not just from employers but doctors as well.\"\n\nAn ageing population and an increasing number of women in the workforce means in the future there will be a higher proportion of working women at menopausal age.\n\nA similar study is being carried out at Kings College London in collaboration with the University of Nottingham, looking to improve the menopausal experience for working women.\n\nDr Claire Hardy is the lead author. She said: \"It might be possible to make some adjustments at work, things like having a desk fan, or moving to a desk that is near a window that can be opened to cool down.\n\n\"Or even having some flexible working. The woman might have been having difficulty sleeping so having a later start to work might be feasible for some women, or just to miss the rush hour as well.\"\n\nEmployment lawyer Jenny Arrowsmith from Irwin Mitchell said greater openness in the workplace would help women feel supported.\n\nShe said: \"Just as many employers now have a stress policy, some employers have brought in a menopause specific policy which provides guidance for managers and reassurance for employees on how menopause related issues will be managed and what support is available.\"\n\nProfessor Jo Brewis, who authored a government report on the issue, said: \"I feel like we're 30 years behind where we should be.\n\n\"The menopause needs to be normalised in the same way that it is standard to talk about pregnancy.\n\n\"Every woman will experience it differently so there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\"Not all women will want to talk about it at work and that is fine. The main thing they need is understanding and flexibility and an awareness that the support is there if needed.\"\n\u2022 None British Menopause Society - For healthcare professionals and others specialising in post reproductive health The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThe unusual sight of a wallaby bounding across the Sydney Harbour Bridge has surprised early-morning motorists.\n\nPolice said the 13kg (29lb) swamp wallaby, also known as the black wallaby, may have come from a golf course about 3km (1.8 miles) from the bridge.\n\nHalf of the bridge fell into the ravine below\n\nA motorway bridge under construction in Colombia has collapsed, killing at least nine workers and injuring five others.\n\nThe bridge in Chirajara was to be part of a highway connecting the capital, Bogot\u00e1, with the city of Villavicencio.\n\nPhotos from the scene show a large part of the 450m-long bridge lying in the ravine below.\n\nTransport Minister Germ\u00e1n Cardona spoke of a \"tragedy\" and said the cause of the collapse would be investigated.\n\nThe pillar holding up the bridge toppled over\n\nRescue workers combed through the tangled web of metal for survivors\n\nThe bridge was due to be finished in June, officials said\n\nOne of the workers injured in the collapse described the moment it happened.\n\n\"Everyone started shouting that the bridge was falling, I didn't have time to do anything and then I felt a blow to my head,\" Luis Alvarado told El Tiempo newspaper.\n\nConstruction officials said that fortunately not many workers were on the bridge at the time of the collapse as staff were receiving a safety briefing.\n\nThe bridge is part of an ambitious programme to improve the route leading from Bogot\u00e1 to the eastern plains by turning parts of it into a dual carriageway.\n\nThe planned works include the construction of 18 new tunnels and 42 bridges and viaducts as well as new lighting and CCTV cameras.\n\nThe existing - winding and narrow - road faces frequent closures with lorries supplying the capital with produce often breaking down, blocking traffic.\n\nThe company tasked with the works is Coviandes, a firm which is majority-owned by a Colombian investment corporation.\n\nCoviandes issued a statement on Monday (in Spanish) saying it would do everything it could to help the families of the workers who died or were injured in the collapse.\n\nA photo taken in October shows the existing road and the half-built bridge before the collapse\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya are living in refugee camps in Bangladesh\n\nBangladesh and Myanmar have agreed a timeframe for repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled crackdowns from the military.\n\nMyanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week, Bangladesh says, adding that it aims to return all of them to Myanmar within two years.\n\nMore than 740,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh amid violence in Rakhine state in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAid agencies have raised concerns about forcibly repatriating them.\n\nBangladesh says it aims to repatriate families together, as well as orphans and \"children born out of unwarranted incidence\" - meaning children conceived as a result of rape.\n\nHowever, displaced Rohingya in Bangladesh have expressed concerns about returning to Myanmar.\n\nSirajul Mostofa, a community leader in a camp in Cox's Bazaar, told the BBC: \"We are still not clear about what agreement was signed.\n\n\"Our first priority is, they have to grant us citizenship as Rohingyas. Secondly, they have to give back our lands. Thirdly, our security must be ensured internationally. Otherwise, this is not good for us.\"\n\nBangladeshi foreign secretary Shahidul Haque told BBC Bangla that the government had wanted to repatriate the Rohingya more quickly.\n\n\"We asked them to take back 15,000 every week. But they said they will take back 300 people every day, so that makes 1,500 every week.\n\n\"So we compromised that we will start by sending 300 people each day, but there will be a review in three months' time and the number will be increased.\"\n\nAt 1,500 refugees a week it would take almost 10 years to bring back all 740,000 who have left since October 2016. Bangladesh hopes that flow can be increased. But as matters stand it is difficult to see how.\n\nBoth countries have agreed the repatriation will be voluntary. And most refugees say they will only return if their safety can be assured, their homes rebuilt, and if they are no longer subjected to official discrimination. None of these conditions is in place.\n\nMyanmar has started rebuilding, but mostly for non-Muslims. It is preparing two transit camps, the first able to accommodate 30,000 people. Beyond that not much has changed.\n\nMore than 350 villages, nearly all of them Rohingya, have been burned down, some recently. The military, which is accused of terrible human rights abuses, still runs northern Rakhine state. It has denied the abuses, denied access to independent investigators, and strictly limits access for aid agencies.\n\nThere is talk of closing the camps in which 130,000 Rohingyas are still confined, but not yet of ending restrictions on Rohingya movements. And nothing is yet happening to reduce the mistrust and fear of Rohingyas felt by the non-Muslim population, some of whom have vowed to fight against any large-scale refugee return.\n\nMyanmar's foreign secretary U Myint Thu told BBC Burmese: \"The repatriation process will commence on 23 January.\"\n\nHe said three more transit camps were \"under construction\", and there were plans to \"build new villages\".\n\nRakhine's state secretary, U Tin Maung Swe, told BBC Bur", "\u00c9RIE \ud83c\udf52 This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They are waiting for the waters to recede to allow the first estimates of the financial cost of the flooding to be made.\n\nA statue of a French soldier from the Crimean War- known as The Zouave - on the Pont de l'Alma has long been used as a marker for water levels in the city.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the water was still well below his waist; during the historically bad floods of 1910, when the city was submerged for two months, it reached his neck.\n\nAs of 09:00 (08:00 GMT) on Saturday, the river level had reached 5.7m above normal.\n\nParisian anglers are getting closer to the fish\n\nWhile forecasters believe it will continue to rise, peaking on Sunday night or Monday, it is not expected to reach the 2016 high of 6.1m, AFP news agency reports.\n\nSaying the city was coping, Mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested the flooding, coupled with recent summer heat waves, was \"clearly a question of the town adapting to climate change\".\n\nShe warned that the high water levels would remain into next week, as water levels subside slowly due to waterlogged soil in the region.\n\nAt the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert.\n\nPerching seagulls are barely out of the water now\n\nIn the prestigious 16th Arrondissement (district), some basements in residential buildings were slowly being inundated.\n\n\"There are six studios in the basement, and we've had to set up blocks outside to keep the windows from breaking and covering everything in water,\" one caretaker, Joao de Macedo, told AFP.\n\nInside the studios, tables and dressers have been lifted off the floor as water seeps through the walls, the agency says.\n\nOutside, a young woman said it was \"great to see ducks instead of cars\" in places.\n\nA health centre in the north-western suburbs, where 86 patients were receiving care, was evacuated on Friday.\n\nA number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have attracted the artist\n\nA mural by graffiti artist Banksy has appeared on a bridge in Hull.\n\nSpeculation about the artist's identity was rife after the work, on a disused river crossing, was spotted by passers-by on Thursday.\n\nThe stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text \"Draw the raised bridge!\"\n\nImages of the mural were shared on Banksy's official Instagram account on Friday.\n\nThe elusive street artist posted two photos of the permanently raised bridge, situated on Scott Street in the Wincolmlee area of the city.\n\nHundreds of fans responded, with some expressing surprise at the location and others speculating on the meaning of the work.\n\nA number of users suggested Hull's recent run as UK City of Culture may have inspired the decision.\n\nAnd many were quick to link the work to Brexit, after recent pieces which touched on the UK's impending departure from the European Union.\n\nLast May, Banksy unveiled a mural in Dover which dep", "aged his ears in an airport after getting a headphone cable tangled on a doorknob, Mr Lappala told me.\n\nIt was inspired by the traditional fisherman's vest.\n\nThe laptop pocket is on the back of the coat, making it feel like a backpack\n\nScotte Vest claims to have sold more than 10 million garments so far, ranging from trench coats to shorts, all with varying tallies of pockets.\n\nIt is great for travellers, said Mr Lappala. And drone pilots.\n\nThe firm even has a rival in the form of the J25 made by AyeGear - although as its name suggests, that one has a mere 25 storage areas.\n\nI can't believe I've come to Las Vegas to write about pockets.\n\nRead all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nA strap which effectively turns one of your fingers into a phone - which can send and receive calls -has been developed.\n\nThe strap sends vibrations down the wearer\u2019s hand and can be fitted to any watch.\n\nBBC Click's Marc Cieslak tried it out at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nThe Red Cross is warning there is a \"humanitarian crisis\" in its hospitals in England, something the NHS denies.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the remarks from the charity were \"unprecedented\" and \"the biggest wake-up call ever\".\n\nSet in an animated Manila, 'Saving Sally' has been billed as a teenage love story\n\nIt's a tale of unrequited teenage love terrorised by giant animated monsters in the chaotic streets of Metro Manila.\n\nSaving Sally tells the story of Marty, a young aspiring Philippines comic book artist, played by Enzo Marcos.\n\nHe falls in love with his best friend Sally, a gadget inventor - portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos - who is also the centre of Marty's universe.\n\nThe story quickly unfolds with stunning cartoons which tell the story of Marty's lonely world.\n\nLike every love story, there are numerous complications and challenges for the hero.\n\nNamely defending the love of his life from a beastly rival and her difficult parents, who take the form of monsters because to Marty, that is simply what they are.\n\n\"Sadly, Marty also has the innate ability to do nothing about everything despite his vivid fantasies of defending Sally from the big bad world,\" described the film's director Avid Liongoren.\n\nMarty often dreams of defending Sally from the evils of her world\n\nWhile it has been described as a \"typical teen movie about love, monsters and gadgets\", the film also touches on serious issues prevalent in Philippine society.\n\n\"On the surface, it's a fun and straightforward love story, with good laughs and visual gags that reference Filipino as well as Western pop culture,\" said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra , who wrote and conceptualised the film.\n\n\"But it also touches on darker themes like physical abuse and escapism.\"\n\nSaving Sally's darker themes are mixed in with the teenage love story\n\nAfter an arduous 10-year journey and a series of setbacks, the team's efforts paid off. Saving Sally gained an entry into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\n\nThe annual festival serves as an outlet to better promote local talent in the Pinoy film industry. But the MMFF sadly still could not save Sally.\n\nThe humble film was not widely shown in local cinemas.\n\nThe Philippine skyline takes centre stage in this film, which features stunning artwork\n\nIts creators said the answer could lie in the nature of the domestic cinema industry.\n\nLargely unregulated, Philippine cinemas have built a notorious reputation for favouring commercial successes movies like Hollywood blockbusters and \"manufactured\" romance dramas.\n\n\"They pick the films that they think people will watch. So it is more of a perception that since ours is a small, non-studio film, no-one would want to watch it,\" explained Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra said \"demand\" was often a deciding factor before a film could be considered for screening.\n\n\"Theatre owners here think that local audiences will only watch films starring big-names and A-list stars, produced by major studios. Saving Sally has neither,\" she said.\n\n\"Because of this, many cinemas don't want to take the risk and would rather see how audiences responds to our movie first.\"\n\nSaving Sally earned a festival entry but was not widely screened in cinemas\n\nTo film critic Oggs Cruz, another problem with the film lay in its animation, the very thing that its makers fought so hard to create.\n\n\"While most Filipinos enjoy animated films, the animated aspect in Saving Sally doesn't favour its commercial ability,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It is an adjunct of the main characters and I don't think it has any effect in its marketability. Sadly it won't entice children or adults.\"\n\n\"A lot of Filipinos are proud of their heritage but ironically, they would rather watch the latest Star Wars movie than support local film festival entries.\n\n\"It's a losing situation for the film makers whose work will get pulled out for more commercially viable movies that will earn more money.\"\n\nThe show's creators turned to the power of social media and launched an online campaign to save Sally, calling on audiences to contact theatre owners demanding they screen the film.\n\n\"Let your voices be heard. Please help us make noise and reach out,\" read a Facebook post on the movie's official page which drew close to 50,000 reactions and was shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nThousands of curious Facebook users and fans began to show their support for the film by leaving comments and writing posts using the hashtags #ShowSavingSally and #ImSavingSally.\n\n\"It was worth the wait and our money. Great storytelling and amazing animation - good job,\" gushed Dicay Galvez from Makati city who shared his joy in finally being able to catch the film.\n\n\"I cannot imagine the love and passion that went into this film, it may be a typical love story but the entirety of the movie itself is a work of art,\" wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.\n\n\"Big movie companies in the Philippines just don't put this kind of effort anymore but the efforts of a small group of people who worked for 10 years just to complete this beautiful masterpiece will be cherished forever.\"\n\n\"I guess business is business but I just don't understand why some cinemas saved spots for other movies over Saving Sally. Please show it in Bacolod,\" said Fraire Acupan.\n\nGiven its animation-meets-real life component which plays out heavily, and its slacker hero, Saving Sally has drawn comparisons with popular 2010 geek sleeper hit Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\n\nBut will Sally see a similar indie cult following to that which Scott Pilgrim enjoyed?\n\nIts makers said the public response \"has been incredible\" and fan demand played a crucial role in boosting the film.\n\nSaving Sally was shown on around 50 screens to begin with, but was expected to close at 86 screens.\n\n\"Theatres have relented to the barrage of messages from Filipino youngsters wanting to see our film,\" said Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra said: \"Saving Sally surpassed what it was expected to earn, according to Industry experts. It also made it to the top four of the festival films based on how it did at the Philippine box office.\"\n\nShe also added that they have received offers for a North American release but that has not yet been finalised.\n\n\"We've also been invited to film festivals in Portugal, Spain and Belgium,\" she said.\n\nIt is as if the campaign is still going on.\n\nTwo weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of \"candidate\" - flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp.\n\nIt is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back", "id raped both women at the property before cutting Ms Dookhran's throat and putting her body in a deep freezer he had installed two days earlier.\n\nHe also cut the second woman's throat, but she managed to escape death and raise the alarm by persuading him they could be together, the court heard.\n\nAccording to the account of the surviving victim, Mr Arshid raped Ms Dookhran and then ordered her to climb into the freezer, but changed his mind and let her out.\n\n\"If he had originally intended to leave Celine to freeze to death, he must now have decided that he would have to kill her with the knife and then, only once she was dead, put her body in the freezer\", Mr Aylett said.\n\nMr Arshid (right) abandoned his car at a nearby railway station and was later arrested in a hotel in Folkestone, Kent\n\nLater, the woman said she heard more screams as Mr Arshid allegedly killed Ms Dookhran.\n\nThe woman refused to get into the freezer as well, and Mr Arshid allegedly told her: \"I'm this close to slitting your wrist and getting this rope and tying it round your neck and just killing you here right now.\"\n\nThe court heard he went on to cut the woman's neck, chest and stomach and bang her head against the floor before sexually assaulting her.\n\nAs she tried to talk him around, the defendant described himself as a \"nasty, horrible, evil person\", the jury were told.\n\nThe defendant abandoned his car at a nearby railway station and was later arrested in a hotel in Folkestone, Kent.\n\nMr Arshid, of no fixed address, is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the second female between 2008 and 2010.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Dylan Farrow: \"Why shouldn't I want to bring him down?\"\n\nDylan Farrow says she feels \"outrage\" after \"years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside\".\n\nWoody Allen's adopted daughter has appeared on CBS This Morning to talk about her sexual assault claim against the director.\n\nIn what is her first TV interview, Farrow says she is \"hurt\" and \"angry\".\n\nThe 32-year-old has repeatedly accused Allen of molesting her when she was seven - claims the director has always denied.\n\nFarrow expressed anger at the suggestion she was simply caught up in the Hollywood #metoo campaign, saying: \"Why shouldn't I want to bring him down? Why shouldn't I be angry? Why shouldn't I be hurt?\n\n\"Why shouldn't I feel some sort of outrage... after all these years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside?\"\n\nThe excerpt, in which Farrow was visibly emotional, was a preview of a longer interview, which will be aired on Thursday.\n\nFarrow, now 32, was adopted by Mia Farrow when she was two weeks old\n\nThe interview was filmed on Monday at Farrow's home in Bridgewater, Connecticut.\n\nFarrow discussed why it was the right time for her to do a television interview after years of claiming Allen had abused her.\n\n\"All I can do is speak my truth and hope - hope that somebody will believe me rather than just hearing,\" she said.\n\nAllen was investigated over a 1992 claim by Farrow that he sexually assaulted her at the family's Connecticut home.\n\nProsecutors did not charge the film-maker and he has always denied the allegations, which he claims had been fabricated by his former partner Mia Farrow.\n\nIn 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter alleging she had been molested by Allen - but he responded to the claims calling them \"untrue and disgraceful\".\n\nMore recently, in a series of tweets posted ahead of last week's Golden Globes award ceremony, Dylan Farrow reiterated her claims that Allen was a \"predator\".\n\nChalamet said he would donate his salary to charities including Time's Up\n\nA number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen as Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal continues.\n\nThey include Timothee Chalamet, who announced this week he will give his salary for appearing in Allen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, to charity.\n\nChalamet claimed: \"I don't want to profit from my work on the film.\" His co-star, Rebecca Hall, also donated her fee to charity and said she \"regretted\" her decision to appear in the film.\n\nHowever, Alec Baldwin, who worked with Allen on Alice, Blue Jasmine and To Rome With Love, said the \"renunciation of him and his work\" was \"unfair and sad\".\n\n\"Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states\" - New York and Connecticut - \"and no charges were filed,\" he tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nSexual misconduct in the film industry has been a hot topic since last October, when a number of women came forward to accuse producer Harvey Weinstein of harassment and rape.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Theresa May \"will miss his advice, will miss his support\" - Laura Kuenssberg on Damian Green sacking\n\nIn her written response, Mrs May expressed \"deep regret\" at Mr Green's departure but said his actions \"fell short\" of the conduct expected of a cabinet minister.\n\nLike Mrs May, Mr Green campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum and had been a leading voice in Cabinet for a \"softer\" Brexit.\n\nHe had been under investigation regarding allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards journalist and Tory activist Ms Maltby. He denied suggestions that he made unwanted advances towards her in 2015.\n\nHe also denied that he had either downloaded or viewed pornography on a computer removed from his Commons office in 2008 and said police had \"never suggested to me that improper material was found\".\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Green said statements he made about what he knew about the pornography could have been \"clearer\", conceding that his lawyers had been informed by Met Police lawyers about their initial discovery in 2008 and the police had also raised the matter with him in a phone call in 2013.\n\n\"I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point,\" he said.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Green had \"lied\" about \"a particular incident\" and that was why he had to go but it was a \"sad moment\".\n\nAsked if his departure left Theresa May more isolated, he said \"leadership is lonely\" but she had shown \"extraordinary resilience in very challenging circumstances\" and was someone \"who is capable of taking very difficult decisions\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"I was shocked\": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC\n\nAn official report by the Cabinet Office found that public statements he made relating to what he knew about the claims were \"inaccurate and misleading\" and constituted a breach of the ministerial code.\n\nThe report also found that although there were \"competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings\" between himself and Ms Maltby, the investigation found her account \"to be plausible\".\n\nHer parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, said in a statement they were not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been \"untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness\".\n\nThey praised their 31-year-old daughter for her courage in speaking out about the \"abuse of authority\".\n\nMs Maltby is not commenting on Mr Green's resignation until she receives more details from the Cabinet Office.\n\nDamian Green was a confidant of the prime minister for many years\n\nDamian Green has never been a politician with a huge public persona, or even a hugely well-known character.\n\nBut he was an extremely important ally of Theresa May. Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades.\n\nThe government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become \"weak and stable\", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks.\n\nSo it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil.\n\nBut the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously.\n\nShe is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure.\n\nIn her reply, the PM said while the report had found his conduct to have been \"professional and proper\" in general, it was right that he had apologised for making Ms Maltby \"feel uncomfortable\".\n\nAddressing breaches of the ministerial code, she added: \"While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations made in the past few weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards that the public demands of ministers of the crown.\n\n\"It is therefore with deep regret that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

They were really concerned for the other people who were injured and for the Metrolink staff.\"\n\nHe added: \"Their quick-thinking and outstanding response helped to prevent more passengers being hurt and stands as a testament to the force.\"\n\nSgt Valentine was treated in hospital for knife wounds to his shoulder but was later discharged. The injured man and woman, who are both in their 50s, remain in hospital.\n\nPolice patrols have increased at all the city's stations since the attack\n\nA Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said the man was making \"some good progress\" and was expected to be discharged next week, but his partner was expected to stay in hospital for a \"longer\" period\".\n\nThe family of the 25-year-old suspect, who was detained under the Mental Health Act on Tuesday, have said their \"thoughts and prayers\" are with the three victims.\n\nIn a statement, they said they were \"eternally grateful for the swift response from the emergency services\".\n\nA GMP spokesman said officers had now completed a search of the suspect's home in Cheetham Hill.\n\nHe said officers were \"increasingly confident that the man acted alone in the final stages of the attack\", but added the investigation would continue to \"examine if anybody may have encouraged or", "\nReaching his ton restored Roy's fluency and power as he surged to 150 off 126 balls before passing the record set by Hales against Pakistan in 2016. He also now has the record for the highest ODI score at the MCG, beating Mark Waugh's 173 against West Indies in 2001.\n\nIt seemed only the lack of runs required would prevent Roy reaching his double century before he finally miscued a pull shot off Starc and was caught by sub fielder Jhye Richardson.\n\nAt the other end, Root deftly manipulated the field in an almost flawless knock to anchor the chase. The lack of runs required was the only reason he did not complete a century of his own.\n\nMorgan chose to put Australia in to bat after rain on Saturday suggested the pitch might be sluggish - only for Finch to punch the first ball down the ground for four.\n\nWhile the hosts' scoring was restricted by the early wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith, Finch continued to bat fluently, if not quite at his destructive best, to reach 50 off 65 balls.\n\nHe was dropped on 60, with Moeen Ali failing to cling on to a tough caught-and-bowled chance, but began to up the tempo of his innings, bringing up his ninth ODI century with a huge six off Adil Rashid.\n\nYet he fell soon after, mistiming Moeen to Bairstow in the deep and Australia ultimately needed him to have kicked on to have posted a par target on a pitch that improved as the match went on.\n\nNot that Finch alone should have been responsible. Mitchell Marsh could not convert his fifty, bowled through the gate by a Rashid variation that went straight on, while Marcus Stoinis hit an entertaining 60, but England's attack did well to limit the hosts with a late flurry of wickets.\n\nThey set more than 300 with a four from the final ball, but that is no longer an imposing target in ODIs and England were confident rather than cowed by it.\n\nMaking his return after knee and heel injuries, Mark Wood set the tone for an assured England display with a vicious opening spell, finding the pace and bounce that the Test side sorely lacked during the Ashes defeat.\n\nThe fast bowler removed Warner with just his fifth delivery, getting one to lift sharply and loop up off the top corner edge of the bat, with Root completing a simple catch.\n\nThat brought imperious Australia captain Smith to the crease, but he could not find the rhythm of his stunning Ashes performances, making 23 before a thin inside edge through to Buttler off Rashid.\n\nRashid finished with expensive figures of 2-73, somewhat softened by the key wickets of Smith and Finch, while Moeen offered far greater control than during the Ashes series, ending with a fine 1-39.\n\nWhile Wood was excellent, Chris Woakes struggled for accuracy until a more promising third spell and Liam Plunkett was solid in taking 3-71, his figures affected by a couple of loose overs.\n\nIn fielding only five bowlers, England will be susceptible to conceding bigger totals if one particularly struggles, but their attack looks to have the variation needed on Australian pitches.\n\nMan of the match Jason Roy: \"It was incredibly special. I don't have too many words right now. It is a huge honour to be out there for England again and to get runs on the board.\n\nOn beating Alex Hales' record ODI score for England: \"He [Hales] wasn't too happy by the sounds of things. The first thing the boys said was about him being pretty disappointed.\"\n\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan: \"I would have taken [Australia's total] at the start - 300 these days isn't that big a total to chase down. It wasn't a huge task. I have no doubt someone else would have put their hand up if Jason hadn't.\"\n\nAustralia captain Steve Smith: \"We left ourselves a bit short in the first innings. We lost wickets in the middle and it stopped us going as hard at the back end.\"\n\nBrandon Lewis became party chairman in last week's reshuffle\n\nConservative candidates will be suspended if they insult rivals, the new party chairman says.\n\nBrandon Lewis said a new code of conduct would require people standing for Parliament to \"behave responsibly and show respect\" to others.\n\nMr Lewis urged Labour to sign up to the same guidelines as he vowed to improve the Tories' digital campaigning operation.\n\nLabour's Jeremy Corbyn said respect should be \"the norm in public life\".\n\nAsked about previous remarks by his shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Mr Corbyn said: \"I would rather stick to where I disagree with somebody on their policies.\"\n\nIn 2015 Mr McDonnell described Conservative Esther McVey, who was last week made the new work and pensions secretary, as a \"stain of inhumanity\", and he has also been criticised for quoting someone talking about \"lynching\" her during a meeting in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. John McDonnell was quoting one of Ms McVey's constituents during a comedy night in 2014\n\nThis was used by Mr Lewis to claim there was a \"rot\" at the top of the Labour Party.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"It's a basic in the Labour Party that you treat people with respect. I don't do personal abuse, I don't expect candidates to do so.\"\n\nMr Lewis - who was made Tory chairman in last week's reshuffle - also set out his plans to improve the Tories' online campaigning.\n\nLabour's digital strategy was a key part of its 2017 general election campaign.\n\nMr Lewis told the Sunday Telegraph young Tory activists would be given a digital \"toolkit\" of graphics, Gifs and videos to help them.\n\nThe Great Yarmouth MP said the party needed to be \"very positive and proactive about outlining what we're doing in government... so we can enthuse them about being Conservative and... not just vote for us but get involved\".\n\nThe Conservatives are trying to boost their social media campaigning strategy\n\nMr Lewis said his focus would be on getting the party \"battle ready\" for the next general election and prepared for some \"really difficult local elections\" in May.\n\nHe added: \"It's not just young people, older people are accessing their information through the digital world as well... It's important that we've got to engage through that medium.\"\n\nAppearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lewis also defended a Tory social media campaign that promoted a new ban on credit card surcharges.\n\nThe ban had actually come about as a result of EU legislation.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

the women's equivalent of the Tour de France.\n\nThe 2008 road race world champion added she had to take her own skin suit to the event in Italy after British Cycling had forgotten to organise one, having to then sew a Team Sky logo onto it at the behest of Brailsford.\n\n\"The facts are they did nothing for the women,\" said Cooke.\n\nAn independent review into the culture of British Cycling began after its former technical director Shane Sutton was accused of using offensive and discriminatory language towards cyclist Jess Varnish.\n\nDespite being cleared of eight of the nine charges against him, the Australian was found guilty of using sexist language in October but denies any wrongdoing and said he would appeal the ruling.\n\nWhat has the response been?\n\nIn her written evidence, Cooke said she had \"no faith in the actions in support of investigations conducted by Ukad or the testing they conduct, both completed at significant expense to the public purse\".\n\nIn response, Ukad said: \"There should be no doubt about the determination of this organisation to protect clean sport; our staff passionately believe in protecting everyone's right to clean, fair and honest competition.\n\nRegarding Cooke's accusations of sexism, British Cycling said in a statement: \"There is always more that can be done and we strive to make continual improvements to ensure that cycling is reaching out to women and girls of all ages and abilities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, UK Sport has launched an independent review to investigate some of the issues raised by Cooke.\n\n\"UK Sport takes its responsibilities as an investor of public funds and a champion of equality in sport very seriously,\" said a spokesman.\n\n\"On matters raised relating to the governance of the national governing body, UK Sport and Sport England have recently published a new code for sports governance which raises the bar for the requirements around governance that all sports bodies who receive public funding will need to address and comply to.\"\n\nThae Yong-ho is one of the highest ranking North Koreans officials ever to defect.

About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America.\n\nThe wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild.\n\nIts natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas.\n\nResearch led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal.\n\n\"This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,\" said Dr Nicol\u00e1s G\u00e1lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the g\u00fci\u00f1a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss.\n\nThey say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the g\u00fci\u00f1a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat.\n\nThe wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile\n\nThis is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say.\n\nAnother threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens.\n\nQuestionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a g\u00fci\u00f1a over the last decade.\n\n\"This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,\" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent.\n\nThe research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology provides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat.\n\nThe approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Islamic State.\"\n\nMohammed, of Leopold Street, Derby, was unanimously convicted of preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016.\n\nHis co-accused El-Hassan, of Willesden Lane, north-west London, was convicted of the same charge by a majority of 10 to one jurors.\n\nThe court was shown footage of Mohammed visiting an Asda store near his home in Derby where he allegedly tried to buy ingredients for a homemade bomb\n\nMunir Mohammed was trying to make a pressure-cooker bomb, like the device used at the Boston Marathon, detectives told me. They were also concerned that he posed a threat to the factory where he was making supermarket ready meals.\n\nIn his bedroom, the police found bomb-making instructions and two of the three chemicals needed for a high-explosive called TATP.\n\nDerby's police commander, Ch Supt Jim Allen, said Derby was \"clearly on the sharp end of a very serious plot that presented a very real risk to very many people\".\n\n\"We don't know where his target was, but we have to be alarmed that he was so close to the centre of our city,\" he said.\n\n\"We arrested him within a few hundred metres of a large crowded shopping centre and we know that terrorists are attracted to that kind of location to do the most damage to create the most impact, and I can't rule that out.\"\n\nMohammed worked in Burton in Staffordshire in a job making sauces for ready meals sold in Tesco and Morrisons.\n\nCounter-terrorism officers discovered that he had been researching and trying to source the poison ricin, and he had pledged allegiance to an IS commander, called Abubakr Kurdi, who called for poison attacks on food.\n\nDet Ch Insp Paul Greenwood, who led the investigation, said officers did not believe Mohammed had selected a definite target by the time he was arrested but was awaiting orders from Islamic State.\n\nThe officer said Mohammed was \"an extremely dangerous terrorist\".\n\nMr Greenwood added: \"Had he not been arrested when he was -

Clive Lewis and Emma Dent-Coad - and a host of academics and campaigners had earlier signed an open letter to Theresa May urging the prime minster to reverse KPMG's appointment.\n\nThey said the appointment would \"only further fuel rumours of a deliberate cover-up and erode public trust.\"\n\nKPMG said its role on the inquiry as project management advisor was \"purely operational\" and that it had no role advising \"on the substance of the inquiry\".\n\n\"Whilst we are confident that no conflicts exist between our role advising the inquiry and our work for other clients, we recognise that strength of opinion about our role risks undermining confidence in the Inquiry,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nThe firm said it would waive its fees for the work undertaken to date.\n\nThe blaze on 14 June last year killed 71 people\n\nLast month, survivors and bereaved families warned the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry could become a whitewash unless a diverse panel was appointed to oversee proceedings.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick's appointment as the inquiry chairman has already been criticised by residents, who say he is an establishment figure.\n\nVictims groups were further angered when the retired Court of Appeal judge said he would not appoint a member of the Grenfell community to the panel, arguing it would \"risk undermining impartiality\".\n\nFewer women who suffer a heart attack would die if they were given the same treatments as men, according to researchers.\n\nThey analysed the outcomes of 180,368 Swedish patients who suffered a heart attack over a 10-year period.\n\nWomen were two times more likely to die from the most serious type of heart attack than men in the year after having one.\n\nResearcher believe it is due to differences in the care given.\n\nThe team from the University of Leeds and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden analysed data from Sweden's online cardiac registry.\n\nThey found women were on average less likely than men to receive the recommended treatments after a potentially fatal type of heart attack called a STEMI.\n\nThis is the most serious type of heart attack where the coronary artery is completely blocked by a blood clot and it requires urgent treatment.\n\nIn the study, women who had a STEMI were 34% less likely to receive procedures which clear blocked arteries, such as bypass surgery and stents.\n\nThey were also 24% less likely to be prescribed statin medication, which helps to prevent a second heart attack, and 16% less likely to be given aspirin, which helps to prevent blood clots.\n\nThis is despite guidelines suggesting all three treatments should be given to both genders.\n\nThe study found that when women did receive all the recommended treatments, the gap in mortality between the sexes decreased in almost all circumstances.\n\nRoughly 124,000 men and 70,000 women are hospitalised for heart attacks in the UK per year.\n\nCo-author of the study Prof Chris Gale, from the University of Leeds, said gender biases for heart disease occur in the UK too.\n\n\"There's misconception amongst the general public and healthcare professionals about what heart attack patients are like.\n\n\"Typically, when we think of a heart attack patient, we see a middle-aged man who is overweight, has diabetes and smokes.\n\n\"This is not always the case; heart attacks affect the wider spectrum of the population - including women.\"\n\nProf Gale said that from their very first point of contact with healthcare professionals, women are less likely to receive the same diagnostic tests, leading them to be 50% more likely to be initially misdiagnosed.\n\n\"That then feeds the whole pathway of care,\" he said. \"If you missed the first, earliest opportunity for care - you're much more likely to miss the next point of contact - and it all adds up cumulatively and leads to a greater mortality.\"\n\nThe study also found that women were more likely to suffer from other illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, but these did not fully account for the difference", "President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week.

But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. \n\n\n\nMr Trump was said to have had a \"contentious\" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. \n\n\n\nA Washington Post report said Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as \"the worst deal ever\". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as \"dumb\", insisted the phone call had been \"civil\" while Mr Turnbull said it was a \"very frank and forthright\" conversation.\n\n\n\nLast summer, footage leaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.\n\n\n\nThe pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: \"The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before \u2014 maybe because of our relationship, our friendship.\"\n\nPresident Trump and his wife Melania with Queen Mathilde and King Philippe (Getty Images) Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump's first visit to Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit. \n\n\n\nMr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the \"critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria\". \n\n\n\nHe also took the chance to remind him of \"the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,\" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.\n\n\n\nNo one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a \"hellhole\" or the geographically dubious \"Belgium is a beautiful city\".\n\nPresident Trump and Mr Temer pose for photos before a dinner with Latin American leaders (AFP) Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far. \n\n\n\nThe president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela. \n\n\n\nVice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather \"Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space\".\n\n\"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" - President Trump's widely reported comments made in private during a meeting on immigration, 11 Jan 2018 Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\"\n\n\n\nMr Trump tweeted that he had used \"tough\" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used \"racist\" language.\n\n\n\nAs the African Union expressed \"shock, dismay and outrage\" and demanded an apology, Botswana summoned the US ambassador and asked the envoy \"to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US.\" \n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.\n\n\"PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, 'US Tariffs were kind of insulting' and he 'will not be pushed around.'

Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had \"stabbed us in the back\" while another adviser said there was \"a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy\" with the president. \n\n\n\nWith Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term.\n\nMr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on \"issues of mutual interest,\" according to a read-out of the call.\n\n\n\nThe two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) - also discussed their \"desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people.\"\n\n\"In the coming months and years ahead I look forward to building an even STRONGER relationship between the United States and China.\" Mr Trump takes part in a welcoming ceremony in Beijing with President Xi (Getty Images) Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned into a meme.

Two ladies worked there. Every time I dashed in and out, there was constant chit-chat and the air was blue with the mix of cigarette smoke and steam from the machines.\n\n\"For years I thought about doing a painting but by the time I got round to it, the launderette had had a facelift and lost its character. The ladies had retired and the smoky atmosphere had evaporated thanks to red 'No smoking' signs.\n\n\"Then, on a Sunday morning foray to Ben Jonson Road, I spied a couple of legs sticking out from a launderette situated in a parade of shops.

Her son David explains why he's backing the appeal and hopes to see his mother freed.\n\nSally's last words to David were supposed to be heartfelt but undramatic. \"You know I love you, don't you?\" she said, fixing his gaze through an open car door, as she dropped him off at work.\n\nA day earlier, she had killed her long-time husband, and father of David, in a frenzied hammer attack. But as he headed to his job, David knew nothing of Richard Challen's gruesome death.\n\nAfter that drop-off, she had planned to swiftly end her own life - jumping from the top floor of a nearby car park. When she realised the car park was closed, she pressed on regardless, driving to Beachy Head in East Sussex. There she planned to jump to her death off the chalky precipice.\n\nFrom the clifftop, Sally called her cousin to admit the killing. She repeated the admission to a suicide team and a chaplain, who had been called to help her.\n\nIt took them two hours to talk her down from the edge.\n\nShe was charged with her husband's murder, convicted and jailed for life.\n\nHowever, eight years on, lawyers acting for Sally Challen are hoping to make legal history, and David is working to help them. They hope to use a law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse, to secure her release.\n\nDavid Challen says his mother suffered years of abuse at the hands of his father\n\nJust as physical violence in a relationship has been recognised as a mitigating factor in a killing, her lawyers say her history of psychological abuse by Richard provides a defence of provocation.\n\nThe circumstances around the killing itself give a taste of the sort of coercive control Richard exerted over his wife.\n\nIn the wealthy suburban village of Claygate, Surrey, one wet Saturday morning in August 2010, Sally visited the house she had, until recently, shared with Richard, her husband of 31 years.\n\nHe lived there alone since she had walked out on the relationship the previous November, after discovering he had been visiting prostitutes.\n\nDavid and his elder brother James, who prefers to avoid media attention, say their father inflicted years of psychological abuse on their mother. Having left Richard, the sons were adamant their mother should stay away from him.\n\nHowever, unknown to them, she had secretly begun seeing Richard again, hoping to patch up their marriage.\n\nWhat actually happened in the family home that morning was far removed from reconciliation.\n\nOn this particular morning, she drove the short distance from her new home. In the car with her was a handbag and, stashed inside it, a hammer.\n\nRichard had wanted her to approve a post-nuptial agreement that would cut her rights to the \u00a31m family home and impose stringent conditions, such as not interrupting him and not talking to other people when they were together in restaurants.\n\nThere was no food in the house and Richard was hungry, so he asked her to go out and buy something for his lunch.\n\nAs she headed back from the shops, Sally suspected Richard had had an ulterior motive for getting her out of the house. So, on her return she picked up his phone, rang the last number he had dialled and found it answered by a woman.\n\nIn the family kitchen, Sally fried bacon and eggs on the hob. Richard sat with his back to her at the table.\n\nShe served him, and, as he ate, she pulled the hammer from her bag and hit Richard 20 times over the head.\n\nShe then wrapped his body in curtains and blankets, left a note saying: \"I love you, Sally,\" and left.\n\nShe bought herself some cigarettes, drank some wine and composed a suicide note. But she decided to delay killing herself until she had seen David who, at 23, still lived with her.\n\nThe next day, David remembers, his mother dropped him at work and, as he stepped out of the car, she made her heartfelt pledge of love.\n\nLater that day, David was summoned by his manager.\n\n\"Then came round the corner, my cousin, followed by a police officer, uniformed, and rushed to me, grabbed me on both shoulders and said, 'your father's dead'.\"\n\nCharged with her husband's murder,", "a decade.\n\nIn addition to the event on 22 December, an earthquake and tsunami cost the lives of more than 2,000 people on Sulawesi island in September.\n\nThe Indonesian finance ministry says $750m will be reserved for immediate post-disaster responses, while another $350m will be reserved for reconstruction efforts.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nMelissa Sharp (right) said \"Barbie bombshell\" criticism was \"disgusting\"\n\nA model has brushed off criticism that her appearance at an agricultural machinery show was \"outdated\".\n\nAt the Lamma show in Birmingham, agricultural firm Agrifac encouraged visitors to get selfies with glamorous trade show models at their stand.\n\nOne of the women, Melissa Sharp, said she had a \"great time\" - adding that her role at the event was \"harmless\".\n\nHowever some objected, including estate manager David Hill, who told the BBC it felt \"like a backward step\".\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Farming Today Mr Hill, who was not at the event, said: \"A lot of women are wanting to be recognised for their contribution to the industry and want to be taken seriously in a previously male-dominated industry.\"\n\nDuring the exhibition Agrifac tweeted pictures of the women posing in front of agricultural machinery and with competition winners.\n\nKaren Carter chaired her local Young Farmers club in Devon and is a volunteer for the Farming Community Network.

Bercow: I require no lessons or lectures on how to be Speaker\n\nJohn Bercow has been accused of \"unilaterally changing\" parliamentary rules in the wake of a row over a government Brexit defeat in Parliament.\n\nCritics of the Commons Speaker say he broke with precedent and ignored the advice of officials when he approved a vote on the PM's \"Plan B\" response, which ministers lost by 11 votes.\n\nMr Bercow said he had made an \"honest judgement\" in the interests of MPs.\n\nCommons leader Andrea Leadsom said his actions were \"extremely concerning\".\n\nBut Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the Speaker as \"a House of Commons champion\" - despite disagreeing with his decision - and said the amendment itself was \"completely irrelevant [and] unimportant\".\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Bercow remained defiant in the face of more criticism from Mrs Leadsom during business questions, as she again accused him of \"arbitrarily changing the rules\" for the amendment.\n\nThe Speaker told the Commons he required \"no lessons or lectures\" on how to do his job, and that he would carry on with his duties \"no matter how much abuse I get\".\n\nThere were angry scenes in the Commons on Wednesday when Mr Bercow agreed to allow a vote on an amendment to a government motion tabled by Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.\n\nThe vote was ultimately lost by the government, meaning ministers will have to come up with revised plans within three days, rather than the three weeks previously agreed in law, if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this interactive Did my MP vote For or Against Dominic Grieve's amendment?

Click here if you cannot see the look-up.\n\nMinisters argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with long-standing precedent in saying it was.\n\nMrs Leadsom was among MPs to challenge the basis of his ruling and ask for clarification in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions.\n\nShe later told ITV's Peston programme that it had set \"a very damaging precedent\" for the conduct of business in the House and the passage of future legislation.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about the decision that was taken today,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\n\"What happened today was that the Speaker, instead of being the guardian of the rules, decided to unilaterally change the rules... It doesn't just damage me, it damages all of Parliament.\"\n\nMrs Leadsom said Mr Bercow's future was a matter for him but asked if she was questioning his impartiality, she said she had the \"greatest regard\" for the office of Speaker.\n\nEarlier in the chamber, ex-minister Crispin Blunt said Mr Bercow had served nine years in the job but questions now had to be asked whether he remained a \"neutral referee of our affairs\".\n\nBut Mr Rees-Mogg said he was a \"great admirer\" of the Speaker, even though he believed the decision \"could make parliamentary business extraordinarily difficult\".\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I happen to think on this occasion Mr Speaker came to the wrong interpretation, but that doesn't mean I think he is not a fair speaker and a good speaker.\n\n\"I do think... that the speaker's interpretation was eccentric, but I don't think it is part of a plot or undermines his standing or any of", ", however, with a tinge of regret despite an excellent, fully merited result that gives them real reason for optimism for the second leg at Anfield.\n\nKarius and the woodwork kept them at bay and they had many other opportunities to produce a scoreline reflecting their superiority.\n\nSouthampton could have slammed the door on Liverpool - instead it remains ajar.\n\nKarius has had to undergo a severe examination of his goalkeeping credentials and endure heavy public criticism in the early months of his Liverpool career.\n\nKlopp placed great faith in the 23-year-old German, signed from his former club Mainz in a \u00a34.75m deal this summer - eventually choosing him ahead of established first-choice Simon Mignolet.\n\nThe decision backfired and he was forced to drop Karius after two poor, error-strewn performances in the 4-3 loss at Bournemouth and the 2-2 home draw with West Ham.\n\nKlopp has never lost belief, however, choosing Karius as his cup keeper - and he was rewarded here with an outstanding display, especially with two excellent saves from Redmond.\n\nHe is responsible for Liverpool still being in this tie after a shocking display.\n\nWhat the managers said\n\n\"Liverpool had just the one chance all game. We were unlucky at the end because we know Liverpool away in the second leg will be very difficult.\n\n\"This competition is exciting, now it is important to keep the good concentration for the Premier League.\n\n\"We lost three games so it is important to have a good reaction.\"\n\n\"We needed Loris Karius to save our lives two or three times.\n\n\"The best thing for us is the result. We know that we can play better at Anfield - nothing is decided.\n\n\"We cannot be happy with the performance, Southampton cannot be happy with the result.

Here Vicky Spratt, deputy editor of The Debrief, describes years of depression, anxiety and panic as she tried one version of the pill after another.\n\nI sat in the GP's office with my mum and told her that I'd been having my period for three weeks. She told me that the contraceptive pill might help. She warned that it wouldn't protect me from sexually transmitted infections and told me that if I had unprotected sex I could get cervical cancer, so I'd best use it wisely. She had to say that, though I was 14 and sex was very much not on the agenda.\n\nMy prescription was printed in reception. And then, a three-month supply of the combined pill was mine. Picking up the green foil-covered packets full of tiny yellow pills felt like a rite of passage - I was a woman now. In the plastic pockets was the sugar-coated distillation of feminism, of women's liberation, of medical innovation.\n\nThis is where it all began, 14 years ago. I then played what I call pill roulette for more than a decade, trying different brands with varying degrees of success and disaster. It was around this time that I also developed anxiety, depression and serious mood swings which, on and off, have affected me throughout my adult life.\n\nRelationships have ended and I had to take a year out from university - I thought that was just \"who I was\", a person ill-equipped for life, lacking self-confidence and unhappy. It wouldn't be until my early 20s, after graduating from university - when my mental health problems and behaviour could no longer be dismissed as those of a \"moody teenager\" - that I would seriously question whether it was linked to my use of the pill.\n\nOne day in the early hours, sitting at my laptop, unable to sleep because of a panic attack which had lasted overnight, I began to Google. I had started taking a new pill, a progestogen-only pill (POP) which had been prescribed because I was suffering from migraines, and the combined pill is not safe for people who suffer from migraines with aura.\n\nI tapped the name of the pill + depression/anxiety into the search engine and the internet did the rest. There it was: forum threads and blog posts from people who were experiencing the same symptoms as me.\n\nAt this point I had already seen my GP several times, following the sudden onset of debilitating panic attacks, which I had never experienced before. At no point had my contraceptive pill come up in conversation, despite the fact that the attacks had started when I switched to the new contraceptive. Instead, I was prescribed a high dose of beta blockers, used to treat anxiety, and it was recommended that I should undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\n\nI lived like this for somewhere between six and eight months - I can't tell you exactly because that year of my life is a blur, recorded by my mind in fast-forward because of the constant sense of urgency and impending doom that coursed through my veins.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Debrief carried out an investigation, surveying 1,022 readers, aged 18-30\n\nI wish, wholeheartedly, that I could look back on this and laugh. That's how all good stories end, isn't it? But there was then, and is now, nothing funny about what I went through. It was terrifying. I was scared. I didn't recognise myself, I didn't like myself and I couldn't live my life. I didn't know what to do, who to turn to or whether it would ever end. I was not only anxious but lethargic, I felt completely useless. I blamed myself.\n\nAt the time, convinced that I had lost my mind and feeling as though I was having an out-of-body experience, I explained to my GP that \"I felt like someone else\", as though my brain \"had gone off and gone mouldy\".\n\n\"Do you think this could have anything to do with my new pill?\" I asked. I remember the look on her face, an attempt to look blank which barely concealed a desire to tell me I was ridiculous. I explained to her that I had felt awful on every single one of the six or seven pills I'd taken up until that point, with the exception of one high-oestrogen combined pill which made me feel like superwoman for a year, before it was taken away from me (partly because of the migraines and partly because of an increased risk of thromb", "\"The civil service is very defensive on Brexit. They do see it as a problem.\"\n\nTom Fletcher, an Oxford contemporary of Mr Robbins who later served alongside him as a senior official in Downing Street, strongly defended his old friend. He described Mr Robbins as an impartial civil servant committed to implementing the wishes of his political bosses.\n\nMr Fletcher told Newsnight: \"[Olly Robbins] believes in public service. My impression is he believes he is there to work for the minister, for the prime minister. That comes through all of his interactions with them. It is not like an episode of Yes Prime Minister.\"\n\nMr Robbins, a low profile official who started his Whitehall career as a high flying Treasury official, wields immense influence in Whitehall. His proximity to the prime minister, from his perch in the cabinet office, means that he speaks with authority on her behalf in Whitehall, in Brussels and during visits to other EU capitals.\n\nSome Leave figures in government regard him with suspicion. Mr Robbins is understood to be aware of the criticisms and has worked hard to build up relations with the likes of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.\n\nMr Robbins was appointed as the prime minister's EU \"sherpa\" and as the founding permanent secretary of the new department for exiting the EU (DEXEU) in 2016. He won Mrs May's confidence as a senior Home Office official during her time as home secretary.\n\nIn September, he dropped his post as permanent secretary at DEXEU to allow him to concentrate on his sherpa role on behalf of the prime minister.\n\nWatch the full Newsnight profile of Olly Robbins on BBC iPlayer.\n\nYouTube has denied its content should be regulated in a way similar to traditional broadcasters.\n\nSpeaking to Newsbeat, the platform's chief business officer says the site is \"different\" and doesn't have the same \"editorial hand\" broadcasters have.\n\nThe Google-owned company is about to launch its first original UK-based production on its ad-supported platform, fronted by Jack Whitehall.\n\nIt will be produced by James Corden and the team behind his US talk show.\n\nYouTube's Robert Kyncl has insisted in a rare interview: \"We're not content creators; we're a platform that distributes the content\".\n\nThere were calls for YouTube to be regulated after a vlog by Logan Paul - one of its biggest stars - showed the body of a man who appeared to have killed himself.\n\nA screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest\n\nThe upload broke YouTube's community guidelines and the company says it's putting in measures to ensure a video like that is never uploaded again.\n\nIn the UK, licensed broadcasters have to stick to rules set by the regulator Ofcom, but YouTube insists it's an open platform.\n\n\"It doesn't absolve us of responsibility, we actually take that very seriously,\" Kyncl says.\n\nThe site's community guidelines act as the \"standards which are a guide on how to behave on YouTube,\" he adds.\n\nHe also says YouTube's committed to hiring \"up to 10,000\" more people to monitor controversial content - and insists the site is \"constantly evolving\" to cope with new problems.\n\n\"The steps we're taking are not steps any government is asking us to do, these are the steps we're choosing to do because we believe that is the right thing to do.\"\n\nRobert Kyncl admits monitoring an open site is \"one of the hardest things you can do\" but says it's worth doing properly \"because openness brings so many great benefits\".\n\nOriginal programming on the site - like the new comedy Training Days, focusing on what famous footballers get up to when they train - is going to increase.\n\nDemi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated was broadcast on YouTube in 2017\n\nLast year it broadcast Demi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated, as well as Katy Perry's Witness Worldwide, a Big Brother-style four-day exclusive stream.\n\nKyncl says it's using shows like that to \"drive more interest to YouTube to benefit content creators.\"\n\nWorking with James Corden and his team is no surprise after the success his Late Late Show's Carpool Karaoke feature has had on YouTube.\n\nThe segment with Adele has had more than 175m views.\n\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

We should not take what we have seen so far as a template for the future.\".\n\nIt comes as the Russian army conducted large scale military exercises last year on home soil, in Belarus and in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad - which is sandwiched between Nato members Poland and Lithuania.\n\nIt was one of Russia's biggest military exercises since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the UK's \u00a336bn annual defence budget meant the government was addressing the range of threats from \"a position of strength\".\n\nHowever, Labour shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said she was sure Gen Carter would have tried to make his case behind closed doors but had gone public as a \"last resort\".\n\nShe added that if voicing concerns over funding made the prime minister and the chancellor \"wake up\", it would have been worth \"making the fuss\".\n\nAdmiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said such warnings from a serving chief were unprecedented.\n\n\"For them to talk about the need for more resources, I haven't known that in my 52 years in the navy - I mean this is extraordinary,\" he said.\n\nThe reality is that Britain would never confront a threat like Russia on its own. That's why it is part of Nato.\n\nBut even as a key member of the alliance, the truth is that some of the UK's weapons are increasingly outdated.\n\nWhile Russia's been developing new Armata tanks, the Army's Challenger 2 hasn't been modernised for 20 years.\n\nMany have been mothballed as the UK focused on the counter-insurgency campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan. Britain's ground-based air defence systems are also becoming increasingly obsolete and no match for Russia.\n\nStill, the likelihood of any direct military confrontation with Russia seems extremely remote.\n\nTrue, the US National Defence Strategy recently highlighted the risks of a more assertive Russia and China.\n\nBut for now, the concern is more about those countries using cyber and misinformation to disrupt life in the West.\n\nGeneral Carter's intervention is more driven by fears of further deep cuts to the UK's armed forces. The Ministry of Defence has a black hole in its budget.\n\nIt is rare for a military chief to make such an obvious and public appeal for more cash.\n\nBut he's doing it under the orders of the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has sent his generals over the top to put pressure on the chancellor.\n\nRobert Hannigan, who stood down as director of the intelligence monitoring service GCHQ last year, said Russia was the single country that had \"kept me awake\" in recent years.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 5 live: \"They have always been very capable, but in the last two, three, four years they've become quite aggressive.\"\n\nGen Carter's speech comes as national security adviser Mark Sedwill conducts a review of the UK's security capabilities.\n\nAll three armed forces have been asked to put forward options for cuts as the Ministry of Defence looks at how it will control spending.\n\nThere are concerns within the forces that the review will prioritise counter-cyber attacks and terrorism, rather than major defence.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Russia's war game in 2017 under way\n\nCol Rupert Wieloch, a former senior British commander of forces in Libya, said the structure of funding needed to be addressed so that money for the armed forces was not \"confused\" with money for cyber security.\n\nHowever, Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the Army has been cut from more than 100,000 to 82,000 since 2010.\n\nLast week Conservative MP Julian Lewis, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, posed an urgent question in the Commons after speculation that there were plans to cut the UK military by 14,000 service personnel, nine warships and 100 helicopters.\n\nMr Williamson said \"hard work\" is taking place to give the armed forces the \"right resources\".\n\nSome MPs have called to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP. It is currently at 2% - in line with guidelines for Nato members.\n\nBrand's wish is for the council to give a building to a homeless charity\n\nRussell Brand has called on a council to donate a building to house the homeless people of Windsor as a wedding gift to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nA petition launched by the comedian has gained more than 70,000 signatures.\n\nIt comes after Windsor and Maidenhead Council leader Simon Dudley called on police to tackle \"aggressive begging\" in the town.\n\nBrand wants neighbouring Slough Borough Council to give a building to charity Shoc (Slough Homeless Our Concern).\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Medieval\": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row\n\nShoc chief executive Steve Headley said if \"people forced to sleep rough in Windsor are forcibly removed\" the charity would be the \"obvious service that would assist them\".\n\nHe added: \"If Shoc closes due to a lack of a building, this would not only overwhelm the other projects, but lives will be at risk.\"\n\nIn a video, Brand criticised Mr Dudley's comments, saying they were \"some terrifying sort of eugenics, genocide, burn the books, burn the people-type language\".\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel in Windsor on 19 May\n\nBrand added, \"of course it's not Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's fault\", but \"it is an interesting indication that in order to make this wedding spick and span and spotless, the most vulnerable people in society are being exposed to yet more persecution\".\n\nA Slough Borough Council spokeswoman said the authority was in contact and discussion with the homeless charity.\n\nMr Dudley defended his comments about begging and said he was referring to anti-social behaviour, not homelessness.\n\nThe prime minister was among those who disagreed with Mr Dudley's views.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel in Windsor on 19 May.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said a man was charged with throwing an item on to the pitch and will face court\n\nA goalkeeper's water bottle was urinated in during a match, prompting police to arrest an opposition fan.\n\nA video on social media showed a man throw a bottle on to the pitch behind the QPR goal during their match against Middlesbrough at Loftus Road on Saturday.\n\nIt is believed the bottle may have been taken earlier by a pitch invader.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said a man was charged with throwing an item on to the pitch and will face court.\n\nThe force's football unit tweeted: \"After an investigation @MPSFootballUnit can confirm that the male arrested at the @QPRFC v @Boro game yesterday has been charged with throwing an item on to the pitch.\n\n\"The male has been bailed", "Germany and Italy.\n\nTwo separate avalanches killed two German skiers in Austria's Vorarlberg mountains.

Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas\n\nNext has reported a sharp rise in online sales over the Christmas period, while trading at its stores declined.\n\nThe retailer said strong sales during the three weeks prior to Christmas and the October half-term holiday had made up for a \"disappointing\" November.\n\nIn a continuation of recent trends, online sales rose 15.2% between 28 October and 29 December from a year earlier, while store sales fell 9.2%.\n\nIn total, full-price sales at the retailer were up 1.5% over the period.\n\nThe retailer expects an annual profit of \u00a3723m, slightly lower than its previous forecast of \u00a3727m.\n\nIt blamed the lower forecast on strong sales of less profitable items such as beauty products and personalised gifts.\n\nThe company said it was particularly difficult to forecast how its business would perform this year, due to the uncertainty around the UK's upcoming departure from the European Union.\n\n\"People are maybe a little bit more cautious, given the uncertainties around Brexit. But I think that's as strong as you can put it,\" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson, a prominent supporter of Brexit.\n\nAt the moment, Next assumes economic conditions this year will be the same as the second half of last year and expects store sales to fall 8.5% and online sales to be up 11%.\n\nNext shares rose more than 6% after its trading statement. That follows a near 20% fall in December when investors were rattled by a profit warning from online fashion retailer Asos.\n\n\"Next has delivered some Christmas cheer to the retail sector, but only because its online offering is doing so well. Numbers from the high street stores look pretty dire,\" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nHowever, he points out that stores still make an important contribution to Next as half of online sales are picked up in shops.\n\nPredictions of a Christmas nightmare for retailers appear to have been wide of the mark - at least judging by the trading update from Next, traditionally the first of the big players to confess how they did at Christmas.\n\nSales in the three weeks before Christmas were strong, and there was a big shift from High Street to online sales.\n\nNext, thanks in part to long experience with its directories, has always led the High Street pack when it comes to online sales, and it is well placed to benefit from the move to the internet.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether next week's Christmas trading numbers - especially those from Debenhams and Marks & Spencer - elicit the same positive response.\n\nDebenhams is seen as the weakest of the big High Street names, with its shares trading at historic lows, while Marks & Spencer is the middle of a wide-ranging restructuring that will see it shed staff and stores.\n\nThe update from Next follows strong Christmas trading figures from John Lewis Partnership, which reported an 11% rise in sales in the last week of 2018 compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe partnership includes both John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets.\n\nAttention will now turn to rival retailers Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, which release trading statements next week.\n\n\"We think John Lewis and Next will have outperformed thanks to their strong online presence, so we still wouldn't rule out some bad news from Debenhams or M&S,\" said retail analyst Nick Bubb.\n\nFinding workers with the right skills is becoming increasingly difficult, according to the British Chambers of Commerce\n\nUK firms are being squeezed by labour shortages, rising prices and a slowdown in sales.\n\nMore companies than ever before are finding it hard to recruit staff according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).\n\nIt warned that higher costs meant more manufacturers were expecting to raise prices.\n\nThe proportion of services firms saying sales were improving had dropped to a two year low.\n\nFour fifths of employers in manufacturing, and almost as many in the service sector, reported difficulties in finding the right workers.\n\nDr Adam Marshall, Director General of the BCC, said these findings suggested the government should listen more closely to business when it came to drawing up its migration policies.\n\n\"Business concerns about the government's recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously - and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy,\" he said.\n\nThe BCC said that the lack of clarity over the process of leaving the European Union had led to stagnating growth and business confidence in the UK.\n\nSuren Thiru, Head of Economics at the BCC, said the UK economy was facing \"persistent Brexit uncertainty and rising cost pressures\".\n\nHe added that subdued household", "by police and Swat teams.\n\nDuring the investigation child pornography images had been found on Paddock's laptop computer, he added.\n\n\"This report is not going to answer every question or even answer the biggest question as to why he did what he did,\" the sheriff said.\n\nAfter the shooting, officers stormed the hotel room and found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

And we decided that the video should come down,\" chief business officer Robert Kyncl told Newsbeat.\n\nScreengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest\n\nYouTube was heavily criticised for featuring the video on its front page for 48 hours before doing anything about it.\n\nKyncl says he understands the criticism.\n\n\"It was a borderline case in many different ways and it took us a while to work through it.\n\n\"We should have responded faster, but sometimes in these borderline cases it takes a bit longer to get to those decisions and that was the case here.\"\n\nLogan Paul has apologised for the video and thinks that he deserves a second chance.\n\nThe video was viewed more than five million times before being removed\n\n\"I'm not sure I would say it exactly that way - but I think you always want to make sure the punishment fits the crime.\n\n\"This is a very evolving ecosystem - so many times we face new things so we keep on evolving those very rapidly.\n\n\"You have to realise that many YouTube stars are young, they are very popular, they have large teams around them and we're all twice their age.\n\n\"It's easier and quicker for us to make decisions than it is for them.\n\n\"And it is our job to work with our creator community to make sure that they are consistently making the right decisions.\"\n\nWith 400 hours of video uploaded to the website every minute, YouTube has a lot to monitor.\n\n\"I think every time you grow larger and larger you always assume more responsibility,\" says Kyncl.\n\n\"We take all this very seriously - it's our top priority and it has been for the past year.\"\n\nKyncl says without technology YouTube couldn't deal with the volume of videos the site hosts.\n\n\"Algorithms have done the job of 180,000 people working 40 hours a week, dealing with controversial content.\n\n\"Then our people, whether that's our community vloggers or our employees, work through context which is harder for machines to discern.\"\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat\n\nKardashian West was told there could be health risks if she got pregnant again\n\nKim Kardashian West and Kanye West have named their new-born daughter, delivered by surrogate on Monday, Chicago West.\n\nKardashian West said that not carrying the child herself was \"so hard\", but that the couple had an instant connection with her.\n\nWest was raised in the US city Chicago.\n\nKardashian West carried and gave birth to her older children but was advised against getting pregnant again because of possible medical complications.\n\nHer daughter North is now four years old and her son Saint is two.\n\nBut she suffered from pre-eclampsia and placenta accreta on those occasions.\n\nPre-eclampsia is a condition that usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can cause serious complications including seizures and death if not monitored and treated.\n\nPlacenta accreta is when the placenta attaches itself too deeply into the wall of the uterus and remains attached after childbirth.\n\nKardashian West, a reality TV star, said in a post on her app that \"doctors said that it wasn't safe for my, or the baby's, health to carry my own\".\n\nThe 37-year-old said she and her rapper husband decided to use a \"gestational carrier\", meaning the baby is \"biologically mine and Kanye's\".\n\nShe wrote: \"Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it's the easy way out is completely wrong.\n\n\"People assume it's better because you don't have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint.\"\n\nKardashian West's surrogate was discussed on her reality show Keeping up with the Kardashians, but her identity was not revealed.\n\nThe star said she had a \"great\" relationship with the surrogate, and \"trusted her completely throughout the entire process\".\n\nShe added: \"I'm so grateful for modern technology and that this is even possible. It's not for everyone, but I absolutely love my gestational carrier and this was the best experience I've ever had.\n\n\"Having a gestational carrier was so special for us and she made our dreams of expanding our family come true.\"\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced that her daughter was born at 12.47am on Monday and weighed 7lb 6oz.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit filed by Blac Chyna against Kim Kardashian West and mother Kris Jenner has been \"tentatively\" dropped, according to TMZ.\n\nBlac Chyna, who has a daughter with Kim's brother Rob, was suing the pair after claiming they stopped the second series of E! show Rob & Chyna from being commissioned.\n\nThe show documented the birth of their now one-year-old daughter Dream and was not renewed for another series.\n\nIn December, lawyers for Jenner and the Kardashians filed for a dismissal of the lawsuit against them, which a judge has granted because there was no contract for the show's renewal.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

They grow fast and big and consume more snails, but being male they do not need to migrate in the same way as females, which require a saline estuary for spawning - so the dam becomes less of an issue.\n\nBut prawns are not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, cautions Dr Sokolow.

That increases population densities and potentially puts agrochemicals in the river that influences the system. But when you add in the loss of the prawns, the situation becomes worse; and it suggests that this tool of restoring prawns could be a big factor in helping to reduce and mitigate the impact of dams on schistosomiasis.\u201d\n\nIt may not be just prawns - ducks and catfish may be useful tools, also\n\n\"Corbyn's fat-cat attack\" is the headline in the \"i\" newspaper - which is one of several to lead on his proposals for limiting the executive pay.\n\nThe Guardian believes pay ratios could gain acceptance, given time, and that the labour leader, Mr Corbyn should run with the idea. But the paper asks why, in a momentous week for the NHS, he chose to deviate from that subject.\n\nSimilarly, the Daily Mirror thinks the idea has flaws and has diverted attention from the NHS crisis - but says the leader of the opposition deserves credit for his willingness to contemplate radical answers to major problems.\n\nThe Financial Times believes many high earners would avoid any cap by setting themselves up as a company.\n\nThe main front page story in The Sun and the Daily Mail is the death of Katie Rough - the seven-year-old girl found seriously injured in a field in York.\n\nHer headmistress tells the Mail that Katie was kind, thoughtful and hardworking, with a particular talent for creative writing.\n\nThe number of cars clamped for non-payment of road tax has more than doubled since paper tax discs were abolished, according to figures obtained by The Times.\n\nThe paper also claims that savings made by the new online system have been dwarfed by losses from non-payment, as the amount of money collected has fallen.\n\nThe DVLA disputes the figures, but the Times says the DVLA has \"taken a wrong turning\" and that paper tax discs worked and it may make sense to reinstate them.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph and The Times report that Bath could become the first city in Britain to charge visitors a \"tourist tax\".\n\nCouncillors say the levy on all those staying in a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, would help pay for local services, offsetting \u00a337m in budget cuts they need to make.

I had to because we share the same name. Middle name as well. Good day sir,\" he wrote.\n\nThe reply came quickly: \"Yeah, and what is stranger is that I've just moved from the UK to Australia.\"\n\nFour hours later, the Australian and his friends pooled their money to buy the London man a ticket from Victoria to Tasmania for the following morning, New Year's Eve.\n\n\"The idea of flying him down got tossed about,\" Australian Sam told the BBC. \"The more beers we had, the better the idea became.\"\n\nAfter collecting their new friend from Launceston Airport, the group staged what they called the \"Sam Mitchell Olympics\".\n\nThis involved a sack race using laundry buckets, a taste-testing game and beer pong.\n\nThe British traveller documented his journey to Launceston\n\nThe new friends staged what they called the \"Sam Mitchell Olympics\"\n\nLater at a bar, the Sams celebrated 2017 with a kiss.\n\n\"It was strictly platonic, but it was very nice for me knowing that he had chosen to kiss me at midnight, instead of his girlfriend who he has been with for four years,\" British Sam said.\n\nThe story of their unlikely meeting and ensuing fun has made news around the world.\n\n\"The games.

Her first serve was landing regularly and with some potency, and she hit 20 winners as she recovered from a slow start.\n\nTomljanovic played the better second set, and it looked as if Konta might pay for failing to convert break points when the deciding set tie-break began.\n\nKonta found herself 6-4 down after developing a sudden addiction to the drop shot but, to her credit, did prove marginally the stronger in an angst-ridden conclusion.\n\u2022 None Follow the Australian Open on BBC TV, radio and online\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\nThe purple dots and lines on this photo of the Stratosphere hotel in Las Vegas show the damage...\n\nA man who took a photograph of a driverless car on display at the CES tech fair says his camera was damaged as a result.\n\nJit Ray Chowdhury noticed purple spots on all his photographs after taking a photo of a lidar laser scanning system displayed by San Francisco firm AEye.\n\nHe says the $1,198 (\u00a3930) Sony camera was one month old and the firm has offered to buy him a replacement.\n\nAEye said its system is not harmful to human eyes.\n\nMr Chowdhury said at first he thought he had damaged the camera himself.\n\n\"It was the first morning of CES and I had some helicopter tours later on where I wanted to use this new camera and now it's not working,\" he said.\n\n\"Later at night after reading up on different types of camera sensor damages and going through the photos again I discovered that it was the lidar.\"\n\n... and in this aerial view of the Hoover Dam\n\nAEye did not respond to the BBC's request for comment but in a statement to Ars Technica, chief executive Luis Dussan said: \"Cameras are up to 1,000 times more sensitive to lasers than eyeballs... Occasionally, this can cause thermal damage to a camera's focal-plane array.\"\n\nMr Chowdhury said he was happy with the firm's response but he thought a warning should have been issued at the stand.\n\n\"I have personally tested many lidar systems and taken pictures up close and [they] did not harm my camera,\" he said.\n\n\"Lidar companies should test how camera-safe they are.\"\n\nLidar works in a similar way to radar and sonar, using lasers rather than radio or soundwaves, explained Zeina Nazer, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Southampton specialising in driverless car technology.\n\n\"Powerful lasers can damage cameras,\" she said.\n\n\"Camera sensors are, in general, more susceptible to damage than the human eye from lasers.

The consequence of those scenarios has encouraged sterling to rally despite the PM suffering the worst parliamentary result in a century,\" said Jeremy Stretch of CIBC Capital Markets.\n\nOn Friday, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a major donor to the Brexit campaign, said he now expected the project to be abandoned altogether and that he is positioning for the pound to strengthen.\n\nThe markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise.\n\nBut more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down.\n\nSo what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely.\n\nThe other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds.\n\nReal businesses are not so sure. With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent.\n\nBut others are concerned the rejection of Mrs May's plan makes a no-deal Brexit more likely as other options become fewer in number.\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit means the public will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium.\n\n\"British businesses desperately need certainty about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. The time for Parliamentary games is over.\"\n\nWhile there is speculation that Britain's exit from the EU must now be suspended as the most-developed plan has been scrapped, businesses may not be counting on this, particularly complicated ones like banks.\n\n\"Firms in the finance industry have put conting", "Ireland\n\nThe backstop element of the Brexit plan is \"not going to change\", Ireland's deputy prime minister has said.\n\nThe proposal - aimed at preventing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - played a major part in Theresa May's deal being voted down by a historic margin last week.\n\nBut Simon Coveney told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the EU would not ratify a deal without it.\n\nMr Hancock also denied reports that the government was \"specifically\" planning for martial law if the UK left without a deal - but he did not rule it out.\n\nHe said that the government \"looks at all the options in all circumstances,\" but when pressed by Andrew Marr, the health secretary added: \"It remains on the statute book, but it isn't the focus of our attention.\"\n\nMartial law involves the suspension of normal law, and temporary rule by the military. It can include measures such as curfews and travel restrictions.\n\nThe UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. If a hard border comes about, people and goods passing between Ireland and the UK will need to be checked.\n\nMeanwhile, a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian claims that the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, has told Mrs May that to revisit the backstop issue she would need to agree a permanent customs union with the EU.\n\nA customs union would mean that no tariffs would be put on goods travelling between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, but that the UK could not negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries.\n\nThe comments come ahead of a crunch week in Parliament.\n\nMrs May will return to the Commons on Tuesday for a vote on her deal, which includes the withdrawal agreement - the so-called \"divorce deal\" on how the UK leaves the EU - and the political declaration - a statement on the future relationship.\n\nIt was voted down by 432 to 202 votes last week, with hard-line Brexiteers in her own party and members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - on whom Mrs May relies for votes in Parliament - citing the backstop as their main reason for voting against it.\n\nA number of MPs have been tabling amendments in a bid to force the government to change direction.\n\nOne amendment, put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper, seeks to introduce a bill that would allow the government to extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU - by up to nine months in order to get a deal agreed in Westminster.\n\nYvette Cooper has the support of a number of MPs, including Conservative Remainers\n\nAlso appearing on Andrew Marr, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to \"block Brexit\" and said the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be.\n\nShe appealed for the support of the prime minister and MPs, as well as for the backing of her own party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: \"We can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out.\"\n\n\"We can't carry on with a kind of game of chicken,\" she said.\n\n\"In the end, someone has to take some responsibility and say, 'if the prime minister runs out of time, she may need some more time'.\n\n\"That is not about blocking Brexit, that is about being responsible and making sure you can get a Brexit deal.\"\n\nEnter the word or phrase you are looking for\n\nThe UK is allowed to scrap Article 50 altogether - and halt Brexit - but to extend it, it would need the approval of the EU.\n\nMr Coveney said Ireland \"won't be an obstacle\" if the UK wanted to go down the route of extending Article 50, adding: \"Ireland wants to help in this process.\"\n\n\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next to each other,\" he said. \"We have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"\n\nBut Mr Hancock said delaying Brexit would not help solve the arguments between MPs.\n\n\"You can't just vote for delay,\" he said. \"You've got to vote positively for a deal\".\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

It's as simple as that.\n\n\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises.

The guy hits it forever. He's got a really, really nifty short game. He manages the course well. It's awesome to see\n\nYes, this scenic January gathering on the PGA Tour is a gentle affair, with a limited field restricted to winners from the previous year. But Thomas and Matsuyama both showed they had not lost any of their increasingly impressive edge during the Christmas break.\n\nWorld number one Jason Day was taking his first, relatively rusty steps back into the competitive arena after three months off and headlined a field that included US Open champion Dustin Johnson and US PGA winner Jimmy Walker.\n\nTwo-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Ryder Cup hero Patrick Reed were also competing, yet Thomas and Matsuyama separated themselves from these elite chasers to maintain the impressive momentum they had built towards the end of 2016.\n\nWhile Thomas triumphed, his 24-year-old Japanese rival came second to continue an extraordinary run of form. In his past six tournaments Matsuyama has won four times and now been runner-up twice.\n\nThe only player to have beaten him in this sequence is Thomas, who also triumphed by three strokes when he successfully defended the CIMB Classic in Malaysia in October.\n\nMatsuyama's hot streak began a couple of weeks earlier with a fifth place at the Tour Championship. Since then, he has picked up two titles in Japan, as well as the WGC HSBC Champions crown in Shanghai and Tiger Woods' Hero World Challenge.\n\nLast Sunday, an eagle at the 14th in the final round in Kapalua piled pressure on Thomas, who then steadied himself after a double bogey at the 15th to claim his fourth professional victory.\n\n\"I think it's potentially floodgates opening,\" Spieth said of his 23-year-old compatriot's promise, after he finished three shots clear of Matsuyama.\n\n\"The guy hits it forever. He's got a really, really nifty short game. He manages the course well,\" Spieth added. \"It's awesome to see.\"\n\nThomas was unlucky to miss out on a wildcard debut in last year's US Ryder Cup team. The Kentucky youngster admits that he feared he was losing ground on contemporaries such as Spieth, who is already a Masters and US Open winner.\n\n\"I think it drove me a lot,\" Thomas said. \"I wasn't mad, but it was maybe a little frustrating sometimes seeing some friends and peers my age do well - not because I wasn't cheering for them, but because I feel like I was as good as them. It's just immature of me.\n\n\"I mean, the fact of the matter is, over the course of a long career, we're going to beat each other. That's just how it is.\n\n\"I think now, I feel so much more comfortable. I really do. Maybe the first time in Malaysia when I won [in 2015], I was kind of like, what am I doing here?\n\n\"But now it's like, OK, I belong here. I should be here.\"\n\nThomas, now ranked 12th in the world, and Matsuyama will remain in Hawaii to continue their rivalry in this week's Sony Open at Waialae CC in Honolulu. Spieth is also competing, along with Olympic champion Justin Rose.\n\nRory McIlroy and Henrik Stenson were the only members of the world's top six who did not play last week's tournament. McIlroy comes out of hibernation to take part in the South African Open in Gauteng, which starts on Thursday.\n\nThe Northern Irishman is embarking on a busy schedule that provides a strong opening to the European Tour year. He will play the following week in Abu Dhabi and joins Tiger Woods in the field for February's Dubai Desert Classic.\n\nOff the course, the Tour as a whole has made an impressive start to 2017 by attracting Chinese money to bolster the French Open.\n\nPlayed at the end of June, the tournament will be known as the HNA Open de France and with a prize fund in excess of $7m (\u00a35.75m) becomes the eighth event in the elite Rolex Series.\n\nThe idea behind these big-money tournaments is to provide Europe's young stars with a viable alternative to the PGA Tour.\n\nIf they succeed in this objective it can only raise standards and, as Thomas and Matsuyama have just demonstrated, they are already sky-high on the other side of the pond.\n\nArtist Claudine O'Sullivan offers an alternative to the Tube\n\nCommuters and travellers in London have been hit by a Tube strike.\n\nMore than four million people could be affected, but some have taken to social media to see the lighter side.\n\nFrom The Daily Grindstone, there was just a hint of sarcasm about alternative routes, such as the bus, which no-one else would have thought of:\n\nEarlier, Clapham Junction rail station was evacuated, but commuters were appeased by a little light music, as tweeted by Alicia Harries:\n\nIt's not just commuters who were struggling.

Twitter user Mark was glad people could enjoy the walk:\n\nAnd Sofia noted an increase in the capital's cyclists:\n\nOn a more serious note, some organisations, like the MS Society, have been using the strike as an opportunity to highlight the suffering of others:\n\nApplicants for the Women Who Draw website were asked to submit an illustrated portrait of a woman\n\nA website designed to showcase the work of female illustrators and promote diversity has got off to a flying start, after receiving submissions from around the world.\n\nThe Women Who Draw website, which had its \"soft launch\" in December, crashed under the weight of more than six million page views in its first three days, according to its US founders, Wendy MacNaughton and Julia Rothman.\n\n\"We had to close submissions because we were overwhelmed. We received 1,200 submissions in 24 hours,\" said Ms Rothman, citing contributions from Iran, Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe site's mission statement is to \"increase the visibility of female illustrators, female illustrators of colour, LBTQ+, and other minority groups\".\n\nOn Monday, it is relaunching, backed by a new server and showcasing 700 new members, whose work organisers have collated within three weeks.\n\nThey also have more than 300 artists on the waiting list.\n\nMs MacNaughton and Ms Rothman, who are both successful illustrators, said they were motivated to create the project after noticing certain publications were dominated by male artists.\n\n\"We counted a certain magazine that often has illustrated covers, and noticed that in the past 55 covers, only four were by women,\" said Ms Rothman.\n\nSomething seemed to be amiss, considering that the arts field within education is often dominated by women.\n\nIn the UK, data from higher-education admissions service Ucas shows that in 2016 the number of women enrolled in design studies courses (including illustration) was more than double the number of men.\n\nSo, do the women behind Women Who Draw think sexism in the industry is an enduring problem?\n\n\"When I see who wins the awards, who are on the juries and who speaks at conferences, it is clear that there is a bias. Although no-one has specifically said", "back initiative\".\n\n\"The moment you have guns in society, you will have gun violence but I think it's about the quantity,\" says Overton. \"If you have very few guns in society, you will almost inevitably have low levels of violence.\"\n\nJapanese police officers rarely use guns and put much greater emphasis on martial arts - all are expected to become a black belt in judo. They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms.\n\n\"The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015],\" says journalist Anthony Berteaux. \"What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Japanese police practise martial arts every week and avoid using weapons whenever they can\n\nOverton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been \"to militarise the police\".\n\n\"If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals,\" he says.\n\nTo underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift.\n\nThe care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces.\n\nJournalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing.\n\n\"One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell,\" he says.\n\nThere is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. \"A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again,\" he explains.\n\nThere are a limited number of longstanding rifle owners in Japan - when they die their heirs must hand the rifles in\n\n\"People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace.\"\n\nIn fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters.\n\n\"It is unknown territory,\" says political science professor Koichi Nakano. \"Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?\"\n\nAccording to Iain Overton, the \"almost taboo level of rejection\" of guns in Japan means that the country is \"edging towards a perfect place\" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership.\n\nHenrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as \"a civil liberty\", and rejecting the idea of firearms as \"something you use to defend your property against others\".\n\nBut for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country.\n\n\"The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna,\" says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. \"But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find the BBC World Service on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFord insists it will have fully autonomous cars, without steering wheels or brake pedals, on the roads by 2021.\n\nThe firm plans to use them within an Uber-like ride-sharing service at first before considering putting them on sale.\n\nBut rival car-makers have suggested that deadline is too ambitious, as Rory Cellan Jones reports from the CES tech show in Las Vegas.\n\nFollow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017\n\nEd Sheeran describes \"driving at 90\" in his new song Castle on the Hill\n\nA new song by Ed Sheeran which features the lyrics \"driving at 90\" has prompted a safety warning by police.\n\nCastle on the Hill, released on Friday, has been described as a \"love song for Suffolk\".\n\nIn addition to describing the Framlingham area where he grew up, Sheeran sings \"driving at 90 down those country lanes\".\n\nSgt Chris Harris, from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing, responded by tweeting \"please slow down\".\n\nThe new singles are the first to be released since he announced in December 2015 that he would be taking a break from music \"to travel the world\".\n\nThey are taken from his forthcoming album, which is called \u00f7 (Divide).\n\nPolice respond to Sheeran's new song by urging drivers to slow down\n\nOn the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Sheeran said he wrote Shape of You with the singer Rihanna in mind.\n\nWhile in his homage to growing up in Suffolk, Castle on the Hill, he says he \"can't wait to go home\".\n\nSgt Harris said: \"Know you want to go home but please slow down on Suffolk roads.\"\n\nAnd warned to \"drive to arrive\".\n\nSheeran is not the first singer to reference excessive speed in his lyrics.\n\nIn Crosstown Traffic, Jimi Hendrix sang \"ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive\".\n\nThe BBC has approached Sheeran's representatives for a comment.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\nLast updated on .From the section Rugby Union\n\nNewcastle produced a superb late comeback at Kingston Park to stun Bath and condemn the visitors to their third straight Premiership defeat.\n\nThe Falcons trailed 22-10 in the final 10 minutes, but forwards Mark Wilson and Ben Harris both bundled over after relentless pressure.\n\nSecond-half tries from George Ford and two from Semesa Rokoduguni built a lead for Bath before the late drama.\n\nThe much-improved Falcons have now won six Premiership matches this season, one more than the whole of last campaign, and move up to sixth, while Bath stay fourth.\n\nBath looked edgy once again following back-to-back league defeats against fellow play-off chasers Exeter and leaders Wasps.\n\nA torrid first half started with Fiji wing Goneva being given too much space to race in under the posts, followed by England fly-half Ford missing two relatively simple penalties.\n\nFord, who failed to land another crucial penalty and conversion after the break, did start a clinical first 20 minutes of the second half when he strolled in to score as Bath were camped in front of the try-line.\n\nWing Rokoduguni produced two pieces of individual brilliance to help stretch Bath's lead to 12 points - first dotting down while being tackled by Goneva and then showing his pace after latching onto the returning Anthony Watson's pass.\n\nBut the visitors could not hold onto the advantage as big flanker Wilson was pushed over and replacement prop Harris touched down in almost identical circumstances, with Joel Hodgson coolly converting both.\n\nNewcastle director of rugby Dean Richards: \"The boys had belief and really stuck at it.\n\n\"We went 12 points down and just went for it. They showed a lot of courage to do that and come back against a side like Bath.\n\n\"The crowd were outstanding, especially that last five minutes, the players came in afterwards and said the crowd carried them through.\"\n\nBath director of rugby Todd Blackadder: \"I'm very disappointed that we couldn't close out the game.\n\n\"We had a terrible first half.

For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes.\n\nThis does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack.\n\nA former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered.\n\nIf this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process.\n\nBut if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, \"the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.\"\n\nThe BBC's Siobhann Tighe was unsure what to do when she sat down on a bus beside a man who was watching porn on his mobile phone, as she wrote last Saturday.\n\nHer story provoked a fiery debate - while some deplored the man's behaviour, others said what he chose to watch was his own business. Many readers also described similar encounters on public transport and elsewhere. Here is a selection of their comments.\n\nI was travelling home from London to Newcastle with two children on a busy train. There was one man at a table with three empty seats. I realised he was sitting next to a conspicuous stack of porno mags and leafing through them. Everyone in the corridor had chosen to stand apart from him. \"Mummy!\" - my four-year-old daughter exclaimed loudly as she swung into the empty seat - \"that man has got pictures of ladies with big boobies!\". The porno man looked at her, looked at them, and crumpled. He put his mags in a bag and freed up the space next to him so that we could sit down. Hellen, Newcastle\n\nWhilst on a flight from Germany to Hong Kong a man in the next seat started up his laptop and was oblivious to the fact that his hardcore porn could be seen and heard by me and people in the next aisle. As a woman travelling on my own on an overnight flight, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I raised it with the purser - the man was moved and spoken to, apparently. As for the countless times I've witnessed this on the train, there's been no hope of anyone in authority sorting it out. You either have to move seats, say something and risk being verbally attacked, or seethe quietly until your stop. I'm not anti-men, anti-sex or anti-porn. Yet whenever I've raised this issue in the past, there's always someone ready to call me out for being a prude. I'm not. I just don't think porn has a place on public transport, or in any areas frequented by the general public. Annie G, UK\n\nI admit I've viewed online porn occasionally in the privacy of my own home, but even I was surprised and felt a little uncomfortable when the person on the next train seat began viewing very hardcore porn on his tablet. I ended up moving and informed the guard. He said he would \"have a word\" with the guy, and duly did, at which point the perpetrator (no doubt embarrassed) got up and moved. The guard apologised to me, then explained that this was an increasing problem. Lawrie, Sleaford\n\nThis happened to me on a train to London. I was shocked and offended. The man was watching porn video involving a yoga instructor, on his phone in the seat beside me. I decided to ask the man to stop watching the video because, like the man, I have free will and I could ask him to stop doing something I was uncomfortable with. Of course, he could refuse and I was prepared for that. As it happens, he obliged and actually apologised. It is not the law's role to protect people from offence. If we disagree with views, we must challenge these views and have an open debate, for that is the only way society can progress. Mel Lane, Guildford\n\nl was on a bus in Huddersfield working with a looked after child who was 14 years old at the time. My young person tapped me and pointed out the man sitting in front of us was watching \"disturbing stuff\". He was watching hardcore porn on a large screen. I quietly approached the man and asked him to either sit at the back or please turn it off, otherwise I would have to have very loud words with the driver. He looked horrified when l told him that a 14-year-old had pointed out what he was watching to me. He didn't say anything, he just turned his phone off and shoved it in his pocket. I still told the driver quietly when l was getting off. I left him having a word with him. I felt l had to say something as a professional, responsible adult and a mother. Annabel, Bradford\n\nWhen I was 14, I was on a plane with my dad. I had the middle seat and an unknown man was in the window seat with his computer. He was reading a lot of documents and then started watching porn. I was so shocked and then I got scared, like who does that in a plane? I've never told anyone about this, but I haven't forgotten it somehow. Lais, Brazil\n\nI went to McDonald's one evening with my wife and children. I sat at a large table while my wife and children went to the counter. A group of children aged between 12 and 14 were watching porn on a large iPhone with the sound on. I asked them to switch it off and received a cold shoulder. I insisted since I had young children or I would report them to the manager. Happily they switched it off before my children came. Paul Brown, Glasgow\n\nI was at an upmarket bar/restaurant having a meal with friends. At a table close by a man sitting on his own had his laptop out. I glanced at the screen and the man was searching porn websites full of pornographic explicit images of women. I was rather shocked, particularly as he was making no attempt to be discreet. It felt to me like a blatant case of sexual harassment to myself and my female friend. The waitress agreed to talk to him and he dimmed the screen. I said I would only be happy if it was turned off or we would leave. She went back to him and he closed his laptop and left. In my view a man wouldn't be able to expose himself in a restaurant so why should he be able to expose degrading images on his laptop?

VIDEO: From disgust to it's ok, Woman's Hour took to the streets to find out what you think of watching porn on buses\n\nI was standing on a packed tube train and a man was standing watching a porn movie on his phone. A boy, around 12 years old, realised what the man was watching and moved away. I tapped the man on the shoulder and very loudly asked why he was watching porn in a public place with children around? All he could reply with was \"you shut up\" and [swore at me]. I told him loudly to stop watching porn and switch it off but he refused. He said it was his personal right. Only my 16-year-old daughter supported me and told him to stop. Nobody else joined in or tried to help me. His behaviour was very threatening. I wanted to take his photo but was worried about his reaction. It wasn't until after he left the train at Leicester Square", "by President Clinton's well-known oratorical talents.\n\nAndy says: \"President Clinton was amazing, he is an incredible public speaker, I owe him a great deal.\"\n\nBut why was President Clinton so impressed with a South African businessman he had only recently met?\n\nAndy had ambitious plans to help transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, to help pull them out of poverty.\n\nInstead of giving them aid, his plan was to invest in, help run and expand indigenous companies, mostly insurance and healthcare funds, so that populations would not be blighted by ill-health.\n\nAnd instead of being a charity or non-profit organisation, Leapfrog planned to be very much profit-making and offer its investors a decent rate of return. The idea was to make globalisation and capitalism work for the world's poorest people.\n\nAfter a very slow start, the business today has more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) of funds on its books. It currently invests in 16 companies across 22 countries in Africa and Asia that have a combined 100,000 employees and serve 91 million people.\n\nThe son of anti-apartheid campaigners and brought up on a farm outside of Johannesburg, Andy doesn't seem qualified to run a global investment firm on first glance at his CV.\n\nHe has no business qualifications and instead studied philosophy at university, before going on to lecture in the subject.\n\nLeapfrog typically invests in insurance and healthcare firms across Africa and Asia\n\nYet he started investing in the stock market aged 10, using money he made from selling the family's crops on the side of the road. By aged 13, he was making money for clients.\n\nAfter attending the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Andy went to Cambridge University. It was while at Cambridge that Andy spent a summer working for a non-government organisation in India, which he said was \"one of his most formative experiences\" and is the genesis of his future idea for Leapfrog.\n\n\"We were trying to get Indian farmers to adopt drip irrigation, which could triple their production and lift them out of poverty,\" says Andy, now 41.\n\n\"But they just wouldn't do it. At the time, I thought they were being so irrational, but they weren't - they weren't prepared to take the risk of doing something new and seeing their crops fail as a result. Why? Because this would have meant that their children starved.\n\n\"So I thought, why don't we give these people a safety net to enable them to take a chance on bettering themselves, such as insurance cover.\"\n\nAfter spending his 20s lecturing and heading up an organisation that supports social entrepreneurs, Andy started work on Leapfrog. Initially, he got nowhere fast, because, he says, the idea was so new.\n\nMost Leapfrog firms, such as insurer Bima, utilise mobile technology\n\nHe says: \"It seemed close to impossible to begin with, but I just believed so fundamentally in the idea, which I call profit with purpose, of investing in companies that serve the other half of humanity - the four billion people that conventionally have not been served.\"\n\nWith no money coming in, Andy had to live off his and his wife's savings until Leapfrog got its first small investment after a year and a half.\n\nThe Clinton connection then followed, thanks to Andy knowing someone who worked for the organisation.\n\nHowever, the president's September 2008 speech failed to immediately open the investment floodgates, because it was quickly overshadowed by global events.\n\nA week later, investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the world was plunged into the global financial crisis.\n\nYet despite this backdrop, Leapfrog was able to secure $135m of investment by late 2009. Today its institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Axa, JP Morgan, AIG, Swiss Re and the European Investment Bank.\n\nCompanies that Leapfrog invests in and helps run include All Life, a South African insurance firm that gives low cost cover to people with HIV, Kenyan pharmacy chain Goodlife, and India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers. Andy says that Leapfrog helps the firms see revenues grow by an average 43% per year.\n\nRobert van Zwieten, president of Emerging Market Private Equity Association, the trade group for firms that invest in the developing world, says that Andy and Leapfrog have been \"trailblazers\" in helping to create a new industry known as \"impact investing\".

But even in this unpromising landscape, defiance takes root in unlikely corners.\n\nWe were in the private dining room of a showy restaurant and the boss was already slurring his words. A large man with a level gaze, he'd finished one bottle of fine French wine and was moving on to a second.\n\nAs he lit a cigarette, two glasses went over like nine pins, one splashing red wine across the table and the other smashing on to the floor.\n\nIf influential people join the fight for legal rights - in between trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming\n\nBut he barely seemed to notice and went on telling me how he'd loved London's casinos when he stopped off on the way back from visiting his daughter's British boarding school.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, when across the dishes stacked with roast duck and dumplings, this local Mr Big suddenly thrust at me a brown file full of well-thumbed papers.\n\n\"Fifteen years I've been fighting this miscarriage of justice,\" he declared. A handbrake turn from talk of boarding schools and casinos.\n\nHe told me he'd got embroiled in a factional power battle. One local Communist Party boss wanted him to dish the dirt on a rival.\n\nNine members of his family had been detained and interrogated and when he wouldn't sign statements incriminating the political target, he himself was jailed on charges of tax evasion.\n\nEven worse, a cousin had died mysteriously in police custody. By the time he'd got to the end of this grimly familiar story of crime and injustice, the second bottle of red wine was empty and we'd long run out of things to toast.\n\nNow I don't usually see it as my job to deliver unpalatable truths to provincial restaurant bosses. The private dining rooms of China have seen more coldblooded politics than I will ever conceive.\n\nBut I had eaten his dinner and the least I could do in return was point out that he would not win his battle for justice and instead would waste a lot of money and a lot of political capital in the process of losing.\n\n\"I don't care about the money!\" he replied. \"The innocent must never give up on justice. I'll campaign for this wrong to be righted till the day I die.\"\n\nWell that brought me up short. I'm not used to private citizens standing on principle in China, especially not rich people. After all, this is a huge, homogenising society under an authoritarian one-party state.\n\nPrinciples often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury. Yes, Communist Party leaders make speeches about principles, but for the public that's even more reason to regard such talk as arrant hypocrisy.\n\nI'd even go so far as to say that many Chinese people today are actively intolerant or suspicious of those who stand up for values.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw may have written, \"the reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man\".\n\nBut you don't hear people quoting that in China. Instead there are plenty of proverbs telling people to keep their heads down or they'll get them lopped off.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's unreasonable man is plain crazy in this worldview. Not someone heroic and brave, but a loser who will go down and probably take his family and friends with him.\n\nIt's not so surprising given that people with convictions are the enemy to a paranoid political class which regards alternative values as an existential challenge.\n\nBut at this dining table I was now rethinking my assumptions about the people standing up to the system and shrugging off the crazy tag.\n\nI'd recently met a renegade bishop who was defying both the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAnd when I noted that many Roman Catholics were calling him crazy, he observed that people had called Jesus Christ crazy too.\n\nI'd observed brave human rights lawyers standing up for imprisoned colleagues. And young politicians in Hong Kong resisting Beijing's surreal version of democracy.\n\nBut the story that made me stop and think was this one among the wine stains and the scallops sprinkled with cigarette ash\u2026 a well-fed restaurant boss with so much to lose from upsetting local party bosses determined to join the ranks of George Bernard Shaw's unreasonable men and women.\n\nIf people like this join the fight for legal rights - in between their trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming.\n\nThe past 12 months have marked another restive year for the Middle East, with wars raging, populations suffering and militancy on the rampage. Here the BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, highlights five issues which helped shaped the region in 2016.\n\nSome hoped that 2016 would be the beginning of the end for the jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS). That might become one of the stories of 2017. But those who predicted that IS would fall easily were optimistic.\n\nThe Iraqi government offensive to re-capture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, has stalled. In house-to-house fighting, the Golden Brigade, which was trained by the US military, has suffered a 50% casualty rate, according to the Americans, though this figure is denied by Iraqi military personnel in Baghdad.\n\nThe Golden Brigade is part of the Iraqi government's elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has been bearing the brunt of the fight against IS.\n\nIn early December combat operations in Mosul were slowed down, because the level of casualties meant that the CTS risked running out of trained men.\n\nThe Iraqi Security Forces have said they will concentrate more on artillery and air operations but that will kill more civilians, which could play into the hands of IS.\n\nBy the end of the year the battle for Aleppo had been won decisively by a coalition made up of the Syrian state, Russia, Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and a variety of other militias.\n\nIt did not mean the end of the war but it was another sign that the war in Syria was entering a new phase.\n\nMore than ever, it was much more than a fight between the government and those who wanted to destroy it.\n\nIncreasingly the war is dominated by the agendas of the major powers that have intervened in the Syrian war. One example that affected matters in Aleppo was Turkey's decision to make a priority of its fight with the Kurds.\n\nThat meant it needed better relations with the Russians, which meant looking away in Aleppo as Russia led the charge against its erstwhile clients, in return for Russian acquiescence in Turkey's actions in northern Syria.\n\nIn 2017, unless the new ceasefire holds and gives way to meaningful peace talks, more Syrians will die and the war will continue to export crisis, violence and uncertainty.\n\nYears of war, corruption and under-development weakened Yemen before the war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition pushed it into catastrophe.\n\nFigures are not precise but one estimate is that 10,000 have been killed in the war and 37,000 wounded. Many are civilians.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, 19 million people in Yemen need urgent assistance. More than half the population has no healthcare.\n\nLarge numbers of Yemenis have been displaced by the war and are destitute.\n\nEvery war is brutal but the one in Yemen also features the grotesque sight of the region's wealthiest countries bombing the poorest, helped by the US and Britain who sell vast amounts of weaponry to the Saudis and other coalition allies.\n\nDespite all that firepower, the Saud", "sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban.\n\nThe executive order titled \"protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States\" was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March.\n\nThe order's new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system.\n\nImmediate impact: Soon after the order was signed, it was once again blocked by a federal judge, this time in Hawaii.\n\nSurrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers, Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama.\n\nThe 2015 regulation - known as the Waters of the United States rule - gave authority to the federal government over small waterways, including wetlands, headwaters and small ponds.\n\nThe rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources, which the president described as \"puddles\" in his signing remarks.\n\nOpponents of Mr Obama's rule, including industry leaders, condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington.\n\nScott Pruitt, Mr Trump's pick to lead the EPA, will now begin the task of rewriting the rule, and a new draft is not expected for several years.\n\nImmediate impact: The EPA has been ordered to rewrite, or even repeal the rule, but first it must be reviewed. Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obama's rule was announced, so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen. Instead the EPA must re-evaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act.\n\nA bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an \"attack on coal miners\".\n\nThe US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests.\n\nAn attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses.\n\nDescribed as a \"two-out, one-in\" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney.\n\nSome categories of regulation will be exempt from the \"two-out, one-in\" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and \"any other category of regulations exempted by the Director\".\n\nImmediate impact: Wait and see.\n\nProbably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said.\n\nThe effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US.\n\nImmediate impact: Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure.\n\nA fence is already in place along much of the US-Mexico border\n\nOn Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority.\n\nHe pledged repeatedly at rallies to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, saying it would be \"big, beautiful, and powerful\".\n\nNow he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise.\n\nOne order declares that the US will create \"a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier\".\n\nThe second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.\n\nImmediate impact: The Department of Homeland Security has a \"small\" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans.\n\nThe department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.\n\nThey argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen...\n\nOn his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access.\n\nMr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement.\n\nKeystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change.\n\nThe second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site.\n\nImmediate impact: Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, to move forward with the controversial pipeline. As a result, TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for $15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement. Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraska's Public Service Commission.\n\nThe Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil.\n\nIn one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system.\n\nThe order states that agencies must \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers.\n\nAlthough the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible.\n\nImmediate impact: Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation. That means Mr Trump's executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare.\n\nAbortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trump's presidency one day after his inauguration\n\nWhat's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from \"providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country\", even if they do so with other funding.\n\nThe ban, derided as a \"global gag rule\" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back.\n\nAnti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them.\n\nImmediate impact: The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants. The US State Department has notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US funding for United Nations Population Fund (", ".\n\nIncidents involving smaller planes also did not figure in the data.\n\nAviation deaths have been steadily falling for the last two decades. In 2005, there were more than 1,000 deaths on-board commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.\n\nThe last fatal passenger jet airliner accident took place in November 2016 in Colombia, and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in Egypt a year earlier.\n\nASN said the accident rate was one fatal passenger flight accident per 7,360,000 flights.\n\n\"Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline, for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry,\" ASN president Harro Ranter said.\n\nDutch consultancy To70, estimated there was now one fatal accident for every 16 million flights, though its report was compiled before the Costa Rica crash.\n\n\"2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,\" the firm's Adrian Young said, but added civil aviation still carried \"very large risks\".\n\nHe pointed to new technology including fears of lithium-ion batteries catching fire on-board, as well as \"mental health issues and fatigue,\" among the main risk factors for the industry.\n\nAnd he highlighted that there were \"several quite serious non-fatal accidents\" including the \"spectacular\" failure of an engine on an Air France A380.\n\nBritain's Andy Murray says he may have to consider surgery after withdrawing from the Brisbane International because of his long-term hip injury.\n\nThe 30-year-old is down to 16th in the world, having not played since July.\n\nMurray said on Instagram surgery was a \"secondary option, something I may have to consider but let's hope not\".\n\nThe Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 15 January and Murray added he would decide by the weekend whether to stay in Australia or fly home.\n\nMurray had been given a bye to the last 16 in Brisbane and was due to play American Ryan Harrison on Thursday.\n\nThe former world number one said: \"It's quite demoralising that when you get on the court it's not at the level you need it to be to compete at this level. It's really hurting inside.\"\n\u2022 None Konta through as cramp forces Muguruza to withdraw for fourth straight year\n\nIn an earlier statement announcing he would not be playing in Brisbane, three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, who won the event in 2012 and 2013 said: \"I'm very disappointed to be withdrawing.\n\n\"I came here with every intention of making a strong start to the year.\"\n\nMurray has not played competitively since his defence of the Wimbledon singles title ended in a five-set defeat by Sam Querrey in July, when he was hampered by the hip injury.\n\nHe made an unsuccessful attempt to return at the US Open in August, pulling out two days before the start of the tournament.\n\nHis only public on-court appearances since then have been in exhibitions against Roger Federer in November, and on Friday against Roberto Bautista Agut in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn a recent interview, Murray said he would be content to be playing at \"30 in the world level\" given his lengthy injury problems.\n\n\"I just want to enjoy playing again. I've really missed it the last six months or so,\" he said.\n\nThis heartfelt and poignant post from Murray is the first time he has publicly voiced the anxiety that many others have felt for him and for his future in the game.\n\nHe will have approached this period of rehabilitation as meticulously, thoroughly and professionally as everything else in his career. And now - as he approaches six months away from the match court - he has discovered all too painfully that it has so far not been sufficient.\n\nMurray is still very reluctant to opt for surgery, but he may come to the conclusion over the next few days that he has little alternative.\n\nMurray has never addressed the precise nature of his hip problem. There is not one accepted diagnosis, but a very good source has told me Murray has a torn labrum. Any surgery would therefore be fraught with uncertainty and my understanding is that even if successful, the repair can sometimes have a limited shelf life.\n\nEvery condition is of course different, but Lleyton Hewitt had surgery on both hips for similar reasons in 2008 and 2010. He was never quite the same player again but still won three ATP titles after going under the knife for a second time.\n\nMurray's other concern with surgery will be his extended absence from the sport. By July, he will have been missing for a whole year. However great a player, it is hugely challenging to rediscover that competitive edge after such a long break from the tour.\n\nJon Flanagan admitted assault when he appeared before magistrates\n\nLiverpool footballer Jon Flanagan has pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend.\n\nThe 25-year-old defender appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday accused of kicking Rachael Wall.\n\nHe was charged following an incident at 03:20 GMT in Duke Street, in Liverpool city centre, on 22 December. He will be sentenced later this month.\n\nLiverpool-born Flanagan has made more than 50 first-team appearances for the club since making his debut aged 18.\n\nThe court heard he had been seen on CCTV assaulting his partner, who he has been in a relationship with for 18 months.\n\nLionel Greig, mitigating, said the victim had not provided a statement and there had been no previous instances of domestic violence in their relationship.\n\nBoth parties were under the influence of alcohol at the time, he added.\n\nThe judge told Flanagan he would face a community penalty\n\nDistrict Judge Wendy Lloyd said she had been given a breakdown of the CCTV, which showed Flanagan assaulting his partner on \"several occasions\" and kicking her at one point.\n\nThe case was adjourned to 17 January when Flanagan will be sentenced.\n\nFlanagan was a standby for England's 2014 World Cup squad, but has only played once for Liverpool this season and spent last season on loan at Burnley after a 20-month injury lay off.\n\nWriter Toby Young says his appointment to the board of a new higher education watchdog is being criticised largely because he is an \"outspoken Tory\".\n\nUnions and Labour MPs have attacked his job at the Office of Students while remarks he made in 2012 on inclusivity have sparked a social media backlash.\n\nThe Spectator columnist said his efforts to widen access to education meant he was \"tangentially qualified\".\n\nHe said he was a target for the left because he supported the government.\n\nMr Young, who co-founded the West London Free School in 2011 and runs the New School Network, is one of six new appointments to the regulator's board.\n\nIts remit is to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus, with powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards.\n\nThe Department for Education has spoken of the \"vital insights\" his record as the founder of a free school will bring to the role but his lack of direct experience and past comments on educational issues have attracted criticism.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

She gets a lot of balls back. You need patience to also play with her.\n\n\"That's definitely one thing I have gotten better at over the years.\"\n\nKonta winners too much for Brengle\n\nBrengle's lack of power on serve proved tricky in the opening stages as Konta searched for rhythm on her return, and the Briton would end the match with 34 unforced errors.\n\nHowever, a first-serve percentage of 71% meant Konta was dictating points for much of the time and she finished with a crushing 37 winners to Brengle's four.\n\nA sharp backhand slice down the line brought the first break of serve in game three and Konta moved a double-break up with a drive volley for 5-2.\n\nWith the contest in her hands it took three errors in a row from Konta to give Brengle some hope, and a break back, at 5-3, but a ruthless return game followed and the first set was hers.\n\nA forehand winner gave Konta a 3-1 lead in the second set, but there were still signs of areas to work on before tougher tests with some loose work around the net.\n\nKonta made sure wasted energy would not be a problem as she accelerated towards the finish line, a rasping forehand return taking her 5-1 in front.\n\nA testing game followed as Brengle clung on until Konta converted her fourth match point, securing her place in round two on Thursday, when the temperature is forecast to rise dramatically.\n\n\"I'll love it,\" said Konta. \"I'm really looking forward to that. I love the Australian heat.\"\n\nKonta revealed after the match that she had managed to concentrate on her tennis despite suffering a recent \"blueberry debacle\" in Melbourne.\n\nThe world number 10 posted a message on social media on Monday saying she had \"just bought blueberries and forgot them at the store\".\n\nAsked about this seemingly innocuous incident, Konta said: \"Oh, my goodness.

If those expectations aren't met then people who should be convicted aren't being convicted.\"\n\nAlison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, insisted earlier this week that there are \"safeguards in place\" to prevent wrongful imprisonment.\n\nMr Afzal described this as a \"bold statement\".\n\n\"I know of cases where digital evidence and DNA evidence would have perhaps meant that person wasn't convicted,\" he told Today.\n\nMr Afzal, who initiated prosecutions against the so-called Rochdale grooming gang, added that internet giants should be required to assist police investigations.\n\n\"A police officer shouldn't have to - as they currently do - try and scour the internet for the relevant evidence.\"\n\nUS musician Tom Petty died of an accidental overdose after taking various painkillers, according to a statement issued by his family.\n\nPetty \"suffered from many serious ailments...most significantly a fractured hip\", the statement said.\n\nFamily members say they believe he was overusing prescription pain medication when he died in October aged 66.\n\nPetty found fame as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, with hits like American Girl and Breakdown.\n\nHe was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, recording albums with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison.\n\nPetty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home on 2 October.\n\nHe was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening.\n\n\"On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication\", the statement said.\n\n\"We knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including Fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident.\"\n\nThey added that his death \"may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that is a necessary and healthy discussion\".\n\nThe Los Angeles coroner's office attributed his death to \"multisystem organ failure\" due to a \"mixed toxicity\" of seven medications. They are fentanyl, oxycodone, emazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetyl fentanyl, and despropionyl fentanyl.\n\nYears of over-prescription of opioid painkillers in the US has created a", "of the tropical storm is passing over Nakhon Si Thammarat, to the south, and is expected to weaken into a tropical depression over Surat Thani province.\n\n\"But all tourist islands in the Gulf of Thailand including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao will be affected because Pabuk is huge,\" meteorological department chief Phuwieng Prakhammintara said.\n\nOne fisherman is reported to have died early on Friday in Pattani province, near the Malaysian border, as waves engulfed his boat.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office is advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to provinces near the Thai-Malaysia border.\n\nDaniel Moroz, from Bristol, said the situation on Koh Phangan was \"fairly calm\".\n\n\"It's just persistent rain at the moment but I've been told the worst is coming later. We've been reassured our place is safe and I think by tomorrow afternoon it should have cleared,\" he said.\n\n\"What's weird is that the locals aren't too bothered at all as I think the other islands will be hit more than here.\"\n\nWhile storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is thought to be the worst in decades to hit during the peak holiday season.\n\nPower lines were brought down as the storm approached\n\nIn the past, tropical storms have killed hundreds of people but authorities say they are well prepared and able to cope with the expected storm surges of up to five metres.\n\nThe last big storm, Typhoon Gay, struck in 1989 and killed hundreds of people.\n\nAuthorities say they are well prepared for the tropical storm\n\nThailand's meteorological department said the storm would affect the south of the country for the next few days and that \"widespread rainfall, and torrential downpours are possible [in] much of the area\".\n\n\"People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,\" the authority warned.\n\nThe storm will weaken as it crosses over from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, but tourists there are also being warned to be prepared for heavy rain, rough seas and landslides.\n\nIn Thasala district of Nakhon Si Thammarat, a thousand evacuees had to be relocated to a university gymnasium after the government shelter they were in was damaged by the storm.\n\nIn the nearby district of Kanom, a businessman told BBC Thai his 1,000-room hotel had to be closed temporarily. He was optimistic that tourists would return after the storm was over.\n\nUK house prices grew at an annual pace of 0.5% in December, the Nationwide building society has said, the slowest annual rate since February 2013.\n\nThe lender says uncertainty over the economic outlook appears to be undermining confidence in the market.\n\nLondon and surrounding areas saw a small fall in house prices in 2018.\n\nNorthern Ireland saw the biggest house price rises, up 5.8%. Prices in Wales climbed 4%, in Scotland they were up 0.9% and in England they rose 0.7%.\n\nDecember's growth rate, based on its own mortgage data, was a marked slowdown from the annual pace of 1.9% recorded by the Nationwide in November.\n\nThe Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, told the BBC the severity of the slowdown was unexpected: \"It is a little bit surprising that house price growth has slowed as much as it has in the last month or so.\n\n\"It seems to be the uncertain economic outlook that is really weighing on buyer sentiment. I think once that lifts then things should start to pick up to normal levels of about 2%.\"\n\nHe said a lot of it \"depends on how we get through this Brexit uncertainty\".\n\nChief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, Samuel Tombs, said the slowdown was striking, but the overall outlook for the market was relatively benign: \"The hefty month-to-month fall in house prices in December [of 0.7%] - the biggest Nationwide has reported since August 2011 - brings an end to a weak year for the housing market.\n\n\"While the supply of homes for sale also has dwindled, the balance of demand and supply has shifted in buyers' favour. That said, we continue to doubt that a sustained period of falling house prices is likely.\"\n\nHe said that assuming MPs back some form of Brexit deal, with a subsequent recovery in consumers' confidence, prices were likely to pick up to grow by 2% this year.\n\nNicholas Finn, executive director of Garrington Property Finders, said: \"At one extreme we are seeing a surge in the numbers of opportunistic, frequently cash, buyers emerging to snap up homes at large discounts.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile thousands of would-be sellers are instead hunkering down and waiting until things improve before putting their home on the market.\"\n\nSeparate figures from the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals for house purchases fell in November, and are now at half the level of 15 years ago.\n\nThe Nationwide said that house prices in London and the surrounding areas, such as Berkshire, had fallen by 0.8% and 1.4% in the past year.\n\nHowever, outside these areas, each nation and English region - based on Nationwide's local mortgage data - recorded annual house price growth.\n\nIn addition to steady price growth in Northern Ireland and Wales, the East Midlands also saw prices increase by 4%.\n\n\"With prices in both inner and outer London falling, the capital bears a share of responsibility for dragging down the national pace of growth,\" Mr Finn said.\n\nWhere can you afford to live?
