["Mr Xi will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces\n\nXi Jinping is set to deepen his control of China's government and economy, as lawmakers meet in Beijing to pass far-reaching reforms.\n\nThe National People's Congress (NPC), a rubber-stamp parliament, will confirm Mr Xi's third term as president, and the appointments of his top team.\n\nThey will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.\n\nThe Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.\n\nBut this year's sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions.\n\nThey will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while \"strengthening party-building work\" in private businesses, according to state media.\n\nThe moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party's control of the private sector.\n\nThis comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was one of China's top dealmakers in the tech sector.\n\nThis week's NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi's leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.\n\nHe secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term.\n\nIt was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China's first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.\n\nMr Xi's appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, it was announced that China will pursue a reduced economic growth target of about 5% this year, while defence spending is to rise by more than 7%.\n\nAbroad, Mr Xi is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China's equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.\n\nLi Qiang, one of Mr Xi's most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines.\n\nOutgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October's party congress, will deliver his last work report speech.\n\nThe political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi's cabinet, will also be announced.\n\nMany will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.\n\nObservers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.", "Rishi Sunak has been under pressure to reduce migration to the UK\n\nA group of Tory MPs is calling on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so \"risks eroding public trust\".\n\nThe New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election.\n\nThe group of MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers.\n\nBut critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy.\n\nMr Sunak's official spokesman said the government believes it is \"striking the right balance between keeping migration as low as possible while providing staff for key areas\".\n\nThe UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong.\n\nThe sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010.\n\nThe party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000.\n\nIn a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives say the British public \"did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings\".\n\n\"Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,\" the report says.\n\nThe report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of like-minded Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, Miriam Cates and James Daly.\n\nAt the report's launch, Mr Hunt, Ms Cates and Mr Daly insisted they were loyal to the prime minister, but felt his government could go further on cutting immigration.\n\nOne of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers.\n\nThe report says this policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000, leading to a reduction in long-term inward migration to the UK of 82,000.\n\nPart of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn \u00a338,000 a year or more.\n\nA report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22.\n\nSam Monaghan, chief executive at Methodist Homes, said not being able to recruit carers from overseas would put more pressure on the sector.\n\n\"Cutting off a key supply of care workers at a time when 500,000 people nationwide are waiting for care is not the answer,\" Mr Monaghan said.\n\nMr Sunak's official spokesman said the government was not planning to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list.\n\nThe government was \"using the flexibility we have through our migration system to ensure we have sufficient staff in key areas\" and \"looking to boost the numbers of domestic care staff that are available\", Downing Street said.\n\nMs Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector.\n\nShe said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force \"employers to look at recruiting local young people\".\n\n\"We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,\" the Tory MP said.\n\nBut fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said while the principle of reducing met migration was right, there was a shortage of care workers in the UK.\n\n\"It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,\" he said. \"There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country.\"\n\nSome of the report's other proposals include:\n\nMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said \"trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard\".\n\n\"Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,\" she said.\n\nShe said immigration policy was a \"political choice\" and there was \"no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive\".\n\nBut she said the report does not \"engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve\".\n\n\"For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,\" Ms Sumption said.\n\n\"International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education.\"\n\nShe said some of the proposals in the report were \"a bit outlandish\".\n\n\"Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,\" she added. \"However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNato has condemned as \"totally unacceptable\" attacks by demonstrators in Kosovo that left at least 30 of its peacekeepers injured.\n\nPolice and Nato troops clashed with Serb protesters in the north where there has been unrest over the installation of ethnic Albanian mayors.\n\nTear gas and stun grenades were used to deter protesters in Zvecan, after they tried to invade a government building.\n\nNato soldiers also formed a security cordon around two other town halls.\n\nThe crisis dates back to April when Kosovo Serbs boycotted local elections, allowing ethnic Albanians to take control of local councils with a turnout of less than four per cent.\n\nBoth the EU and US have criticised the Kosovan authorities for destabilising the situation in north Kosovo, and warned against any actions that could inflame ethnic tensions there.\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, after years of strained relations between its Serb and mainly Albanian inhabitants.\n\nIt has been recognised by the United States and major European Union countries, but Serbia, backed by its powerful ally Russia, refuses to do so, as do most ethnic Serbs inside Kosovo.\n\nWhile ethnic Albanians make up more than 90% of the population in Kosovo as a whole, Serbs form the majority of the population in the northern region.\n\nPeacekeepers from Italy and Hungary were among those hurt in the latest violence on Monday, Nato said.\n\nOfficials said 30 troops were hurt, with injuries including fractures and burns from improvised explosive incendiary devices. Three soldiers were also wounded by firearms.\n\nBut Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 11 were Italians, three of whom were in a serious but not life-threatening condition. Hungary's defence ministry said at least 20 of its soldiers were injured, and seven were in a serious but stable condition.\n\nFive people have been arrested in relation to the attacks.\n\nSerbian President Aleksander Vucic said more than 50 Serbs had needed hospital treatment and that even more were injured.\n\nProtesters were outraged not just that ethnic Albanian mayors had taken office, but by the heavy-handed actions of Kosovo police, who turned up with rifles and armoured vehicles.\n\nFurther provoking them was the fact Serbian flags had been removed from municipal buildings and replaced with Kosovo flags.\n\nKosovo's prime minster, Albin Kurti, insisted the security forces were merely ensuring that democratically elected mayors could represent their constituents.\n\nBut he has been accused of trying to create chaos for everyone in the region by trying to install leaders who do not have a credible mandate.\n\n\"Do not allow those fake mayors to enter here because they won 50 votes,\" said Igor Simic, the deputy head of the Serb List, the biggest Kosovo Serb party backed by the government in Belgrade.\n\n\"Even Albanians are not voting for it.\"\n\nThe worst incidents of violence on Monday were in Zvecan. A crowd gathered at the municipal building early in the morning. They were hoping to prevent the new, ethnic Albanian mayor from entering the building.\n\nThe Nato-led troops at first tried to separate protesters from the police, but later dispersed the crowd using shields and batons, AFP news agency reported.\n\nSeveral protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the soldiers, the agency said.\n\nKosovo police said one of their cars was set on fire and that \"provocative captions with Serbian and Russian symbols\" were written on other vehicles.\n\nNato called the attacks \"totally unacceptable\", adding in a statement that it called on all sides to \"refrain from actions that further inflame tensions, and to engage in dialogue\".\n\nAnd the task force's commander, Maj Gen Angelo Michele Ristuccia, urged both sides to \"take full responsibility for what happened and prevent any further escalation, rather than hide behind false narratives\".\n\nMr Vucic put the army on the highest level of combat alert in response to the fresh protests. He moved army units close to Kosovo's border on Friday, following similar clashes.\n\nThe recent disorder began after Kosovo Serbs - who account for about 5% of the country's 1.8 million population overall - boycotted April's local elections in four northern municipalities that are majority Serb. This allowed ethnic Albanians to take control of the councils.\n\nBelgrade backed the boycott - resulting in a turnout of just 3.47% - which was sparked after the Serb community demanded the establishment of a promised association of Serbian municipalities.\n\nDespite its support for Kosovo, Both the EU and US have criticised Pristina for destabilising the situation and urged the authorities to \"de-escalate\". This advice appears to have fallen on deaf ears.", "The conflict unfolding in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, threatens to spread across the most fragile parts of Africa\n\nIf you want to know why Sudan matters to so many other countries, just take a look at a map.\n\nThere's a reason why the fighting that has erupted there over the past week is ringing so many international alarm bells. Sudan is not only huge - the third largest country in Africa - it also stretches across an unstable and geopolitically vital region.\n\nWhatever happens militarily or politically in the capital, Khartoum, ripples across some of the most fragile parts of the continent.\n\nThe country straddles the Nile River, making the nation's fate of almost existential importance; downstream, to water-hungry Egypt, and upstream, to land-locked Ethiopia with its ambitious hydro-electric plans that now affect the river's flow.\n\nSudan borders seven countries in all, each with security challenges that are intertwined with the politics of Khartoum.\n\nTrouble in Sudan's western Darfur region almost inevitably spills over into neighbouring Chad, and vice versa. Weapons and fighters from coup-prone Chad, and from the war-torn Central African Republic, often flow freely across the region's porous borders. Much the same has proved true with Libya, to the north-west.\n\nSudan borders the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia - only recently emerging from a gruelling conflict that involved another unpredictable neighbour, the isolated and highly militarised autocracy of Eritrea. There is also tension on other parts of Ethiopia and Sudan's shared - and in places, contested - border.\n\nTo the south, Sudan faces a relatively new nation, South Sudan, which formally broke away from its northern neighbour in 2011 after one of Africa's longest and bloodiest civil wars. That border, too, remains unstable.\n\nSouth Sudan quickly spiralled into the sort of broad scale civil war that some fear could now be Sudan's fate too. Upon independence, South Sudan took with it most of the region's precious oil fields, leaving Sudan far poorer, and contributing, indirectly, to the current crisis in Khartoum, as rival military groups now struggle for control of shrinking economic resources, like gold and agriculture.\n\nPeople are fleeing neighbourhoods close to the fighting in Khartoum, as the Sudanese army battles a paramilitary group for control\n\nAs part of that struggle, Sudan's generals - the military have always been big, allegedly corrupt players in the local economy - have gone in search of foreign partners. For agriculture, that has meant inviting Gulf states to invest in the huge, and relatively underused potential of the rich soil that borders the Nile River.\n\nWhen it comes to gold, far murkier deals appear to have been done with Russia's notorious Wagner group, which is accused of smuggling gold out of Sudan. The US Treasury has accused Wagner's head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, of \"exploiting Sudan's natural resources for personal gain and spreading malign influence\" online through his \"troll farm\".\n\nRussia's interests in the country, and region, go much further. Eastern Sudan's stark coastline looks out onto the Red Sea.\n\nThe Kremlin has, for years, been seeking to establish a military base in Port Sudan, giving its warships access to - and influence over - one of the world's busiest and most contested sea lanes. Moscow has come close to finalising a deal about the base with Sudan's military government - which seized power in 2021 in a coup.\n\nNot surprisingly, a vast range of governments are now seeking to influence events on the ground in Sudan.\n\nFor now, the focus appears to be on ending the battle between the army and the RSF paramilitary group before it spreads further, and threatens to evolve from a relatively straightforward power struggle into a more complex civil war.\n\nBeyond that, some foreign governments are anxious to help guide Sudan towards the democracy that many had hoped might follow the overthrow, back in 2019, of the country's brutal ruler, Omar al-Bashir.\n\nBut other states may prefer to back another strongman, and to thwart the will of the Sudanese people, who have waited decades for one of Africa's struggling giants to fulfil its potential.", "A heatwave is sweeping across parts of southern Europe, with potential record-breaking temperatures in the coming days.\n\nTemperatures are expected to surpass 40C (104F) in parts of Spain, France, Greece, Croatia and Turkey.\n\nIn Italy, temperatures could reach as high as 48.8C (119.8F). A red alert warning has been issued for 10 cities, including Rome, Bologna and Florence.\n\nOn Tuesday, a man in his forties died after collapsing in northern Italy.\n\nItalian media reported that the 44-year-old worker was painting zebra crossing lines in the town of Lodi, near Milan, before he collapsed from the heat. He was taken to hospital where he later died.\n\nSeveral visitors to the country have collapsed from heatstroke, including a British man outside the Colosseum in Rome.\n\nPeople have been advised to drink at least two litres of water a day and to avoid coffee and alcohol, which are dehydrating.\n\nTwo Australian tourists on the streets of Rome told the BBC they were \"really surprised\" by the heat.\n\n\"It does spoil our plans as tourists a bit,\" Melbourne friends Maria and Gloria said. \"We are trying to not go out in the middle of the day.\"\n\nMaria and Gloria, from Melbourne, are visiting Rome\n\nItalian tourists Andrea Romano and Michele La Penna told the BBC their hometown of Potenza, in the Apennine mountains, has \"more humane temperatures\" than Rome.\n\n\"We need to start doing something about climate change.

BBC Weather says large swathes of southern Europe could see temperatures in the low to mid 40s - and possibly higher.\n\nBut as Cerberus dies out, Italian weather forecasters are warning that the next heatwave - dubbed Charon after the ferryman who delivered souls into the underworld in Greek mythology - will push temperatures back up towards 43C (109F) in Rome and a possible 47C (116F) on the island of Sardinia.\n\nIt isn't just Europe that is hot.\n\nThis summer has seen temperature records smashed in parts of Canada and the US as well as across a swathe of Asia including in India and China.\n\nSea temperatures in the Atlantic have hit record highs while Antarctic sea ice is at the lowest extent ever recorded.\n\nAnd it is going to get hotter.\n\nA weather pattern called El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific. It tends to drive up temperatures by around 0.2C on average.\n\nThat may not sound much but add in the roughly 1.1C that climate change has pushed average temperatures up by worldwide and we are nudging perilously close to the 1.5C threshold the world has agreed to try and keep global temperatures below.\n\nLet's set things in a historic context to give us some perspective.\n\nThe first week of July is reckoned to have been the hottest week since records began.\n\nBut scientists can use the bubbles of air trapped in ancient Antarctic ice to estimate temperatures going back more than a million years.\n\nThat data suggests that that last week was the hottest week for some 125,000 years.\n\nIt was a geological period known as the Eemian when there were hippopotamuses in the Thames and sea levels were reckoned to be some 5m (16.4ft) higher.\n\nA new study says 61,672 people died in Europe as a result of the heat last year. ISGlobal Institute in Barcelona - which researches global health - said Italy had the most deaths that could be attributable to the heat, with 18,010, while Spain had 11,324 and Germany 8,173.\n\nThe fear is that the heat could cause many more deaths this summer.\n\nCities in Spain with the highest risk of deaths caused by the heat are Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, M\u00e1laga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca and Bilbao, according to ISGlobal's research.\n\nA heatwave is a period of hot weather where temperatures are higher than is expected for the time of year.\n\nExperts say periods of exceptionally hot weather are becoming more frequent and climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.\n\nAt present there is no indication the heat in southern Europe will reach the UK any time soon - with the UK remaining in cooler, Atlantic air throughout next week, according to BBC Weather's Darren Bett.\n\nThe UK is experiencing a July that has been slightly wetter than normal, with temperatures that feel rather low. But this is mostly in contrast to the weather in the UK in June, which was the warmest on record by a considerable margin - something which, according to the Met Office, bore the \"fingerprint of climate change\".\n\u2022 None The new normal - why this summer has been so very hot", "If you are not sure about the potential charges, please ask your mobile network provider.

The prime minister has promised to stop them.\n\nAt least part of what we are seeing in the debates over sorting places for migrants to stay is the consequence of a failure to do that.\n\nAnother element is the colossal backlog of asylum claims that need to be processed. But a significant part of all of this is a generational challenge lots of rich countries will face.\n\nCourtesy of globalisation - smartphones, the internet, satellite television - it has never been easier for poor people in low-income countries, or those caught up in wars, natural disasters or, perhaps in future, the consequences of climate change, to be aware of a richer world they might prefer.\n\nWhat they might easily conclude is a rational decision to seek a better life. Which means rich countries, and their governments, have to conclude what a rational response to this is.\n\nHow can a country be sustainably compassionate, if indeed that is what it chooses to be? And what would that look like, when both of those words would be contested?\n\nRich countries now have to confront what to do about all this, often still in possession of rules and conventions that pre-date the era of the jet aeroplane and mass international travel.\n\nAnd they - we - confront these challenges burdened by the weight and contradictions of the dilemmas they generate.\n\nWhat to do practically, politically, logistically, financially, morally?\n\nRight now, the government confronts an expensive mess.\n\nAs my colleagues Daniel Sandford and Callum May reported earlier this month, more than 51,000 asylum seekers are currently being put up in nearly 400 hotels around the UK.\n\nIt is costing the taxpayer \u00a36m a day. The government is desperate to find a solution.\n\nSomething cheaper, something more obviously basic (in the hope that that itself acts as a deterrent) and big sites that can house a lot of people.\n\nFormer military bases have long been top of the wanted list for ministers - land and buildings relatively easily acquired, that can be converted and up and running quickly. Or so they hope.\n\nThe political strategy here is this sort of thing is always going to annoy some people, but fewer bigger sites will annoy fewer people, while housing plenty of people.\n\nThe thing is, those they are annoying are getting angry and getting organised.\n\nConservative-controlled Braintree District Council has asked the High Court to block plans for a migrants site on an old RAF base in Essex.\n\nAnd a legal battle looms between the Conservative-led West Lindsey District Council and the government over a similar plan in Lincolnshire.\n\nSome senior voices in government were talking up the prospect of ferries and barges also being used to house migrants - leading to some excitable newspaper front pages.\n\nStrikingly, while floating accommodation was mentioned by the Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, there isn't yet any detail about the plans.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

And it is unquestionable the problems are massive.\n\nBut it is also unquestionable that the next government, of whatever political colour, will inherit much of the same set of problems.\n\nAnd they are the same set of problems so many other similar rich countries confront - and will continue to confront for decades to come.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nPolice are searching for multiple suspects after a shooting in the US city of Baltimore left two people dead and 28 others injured.\n\nFifteen children were among those wounded when gunfire erupted at a block party in the Brooklyn Homes area of the city on Sunday.\n\nIt is not clear whether the attack was targeted, police said, and officers are hunting for at least two suspects.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday police announced a reward of $28,000 (\u00a322,000) for information on the suspects.\n\nAuthorities said multiple weapons and bullet casings were recovered from the scene of the crime.\n\nPolice have yet to name a suspect, but said a young man who has been seen in footage circulating on social media appearing to pull a semi-automatic weapon from a backpack is one of the suspects.\n\n\"Anyone who had a weapon at the scene will be one of our suspects until we eliminate that they are not,\" said Baltimore Police Department acting commissioner Richard Worley.\n\nThe shooting began at about 00:35 local time (04:35 GMT) in a courtyard between a pair of rowhouses in the south of the city.

Paid sharing costs 3.99 euros (\u00a33.50; $4.40) in Portugal, and 5.99 euros (\u00a35.27; $6.56) in Spain.\n\nThe company warned investors to expect some cancellations as it expands the programme but said: \"Longer term, paid sharing will ensure a bigger revenue base from which we can grow as we improve our service\".\n\nIn Canada, where the changes were introduced in February, its paid membership base is now larger than it was before the changes and revenue growth has accelerated, it said.\n\nCalifornia-based Netflix has come a long way since it started shipping DVDs to customers in the US in 1998.\n\nIt launched its streaming service in 2007 and is now a global behemoth with more than 232 million subscribers around the world.\n\nIn the investor letter, Netflix described the DVD service, which will shut down in September, as the \"booster rocket that got streaming to a leading position\".\n\n\"We feel so privileged to have been able to share movie nights with our DVD members for so long, so proud of what our employees achieved and excited to continue pleasing entertainment fans for many more decades to come,\" the company said.\n\nBut despite its early lead, Netflix's dominance of the streaming industry has started to erode as competition has intensified.\n\nThe company added just 1.75 million paid memberships in the January to March period.

It reported $1.3bn in profit, down from nearly $1.6bn last year.\n\nPaul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence said the results showed Netflix's paid password sharing program and ads business had hit \"early speed bumps and even in the best-case scenario, will take a long time to scale [up]\".\n\n\"These are worrying signs for a business that, despite still being a market leader, is struggling to get its mojo back,\" he said.", "A soundtrack of explosions, a skyline dominated by bitter, black smoke, a daily existence of fear and uncertainty as bullets, rockets and rumours fly.\n\nLife in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and in many other parts of the country, has taken a sudden, very dramatic turn for the worse.\n\nAt the heart of it are two generals: Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nThe two worked together, and carried out a coup together - now their battle for supremacy is tearing Sudan apart.\n\nThe relationship between the two goes back a long way.\n\nBoth played key roles in the counter-insurgency against Darfuri rebels, in the civil war in Sudan's western region that began in 2003.\n\nGen Burhan rose to control the Sudanese army in Darfur.\n\nHemedti was the commander of one of the many Arab militias, collectively known as the Janjaweed, which the government employed to brutally put down the largely non-Arab Darfuri rebel groups.\n\nMajak D'Agoot was the deputy director of the National Intelligence and Security Services at the time - before becoming deputy defence minister in South Sudan when it seceded in 2011.\n\nHe met Gen Burhan and Hemedti in Darfur, and said they worked well together. But he told the BBC he saw little sign that either would rise to the top of the state.\n\nHemedti was simply a militia leader \"playing a counter-insurgency role, helping the military\", while Gen Burhan was a career soldier, though \"with all the ambitions of the Sudanese officer corps, anything was possible\".\n\nThe military has been running Sudan for most of its post-independence history.\n\nThe government's tactics in Darfur, once described by Sudan expert Alex de Waal as \"counter-insurgency on the cheap\", used regular troops, ethnic militias and air power to fight off the rebels - with little to no regard for civilian casualties.\n\nDarfur has been described as the first genocide of the 21st Century, with the Janjaweed accused of ethnic cleansing and using mass rape as a weapon of war.\n\nHemedti eventually became the commander of what could be described as an offshoot of the Janjaweed, his RSF.\n\nThe Janjaweed militia were accused of ethnic cleansing and mass rape during the Darfur conflict\n\nHemedti's power grew massively once he began supplying troops to fight for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nSudan's then-military ruler, Omar al-Bashir, came to rely on Hemedti and the RSF as a counterweight to the regular armed forces, in the hope that it would be too difficult for any single armed group to depose him.\n\nIn the end - after months of popular protests - the generals clubbed together to overthrow Bashir, in April 2019.\n\nLater that year, they signed an agreement with the protesters to form a civilian-led government overseen by the Sovereign Council, a joint civilian-military body, with Gen Burhan at its head, and Hemedti as his deputy.\n\nIt lasted two years - until October 2021 - when the military struck, taking power for themselves, with Gen Burhan again at the head of the state and Hemedti again his deputy.\n\nSiddig Tower Kafi was a civilian member of the Sovereign Council, and so regularly met the two generals.\n\nHe said he saw no sign of any disagreements until after the 2021 coup.\n\nThen \"Gen Burhan started to restore the Islamists and the former regime members to their old positions\", he told the BBC.\n\n\"It was becoming clear that the plan of Gen Burhan was to restore the old regime of Omar al-Bashir to power.\"\n\nMr Siddig says that this is when Hemedti began to have doubts, as he felt Bashir's cronies had never fully trusted him.\n\nSudanese politics has always been dominated by an elite largely drawn from the ethnic groups based around Khartoum and the River Nile.\n\nHemedti comes from Darfur, and the Sudanese elite often talk about him and his soldiers in pejorative terms, as \"country bumpkins\" unfit to rule the state.\n\nOver the last two or three years, he has tried to position himself as a national figure, and even as a representative of the marginalised peripheries - trying to forge alliances with rebel groups in Darfur and South Kordofan that he had previously been tasked with destroying.\n\nHe has also spoken regularly of a need for democracy despite his forces having brutally put down civilian protests in the past.\n\nTensions between the army and the RSF grew as a deadline for forming a civilian government approached, focused on the thorny issue of how the RSF should be re-integrated into the regular armed forces.\n\nFlames and smoke can be seen in Khartoum as the forces controlled by the two generals clash\n\nAnd then the fighting began, pitting the RSF against the SAF, Hemedti against Gen Burhan, for control of the Sudanese state.\n\nIn one way, at least, Hemedti has followed in the footsteps of the SAF top brass, who he is now fighting - over the last few years, he has built a vast business empire, including interests in gold mines and many other sectors.\n\nGen Burhan and Hemedti have both faced calls from civilian leaders and victims of the conflict in Darfur and elsewhere to face trial for alleged abuses.\n\nThe stakes are extremely high, and there are plenty of reasons for these former-allies-turned-bitter-enemies to not back down.", "The IDF is bolstering troop numbers as it prepares for a possible attack by Iran\n\nGPS is being blocked across swathes of Israel in order to disrupt missiles and drones, as tensions rise with Iran.\n\nIran has vowed to respond after a strike on its consulate building in Syria on Monday -

Jaclyn Daly said she does not earn enough working as a carer to support herself while studying\n\nSocial care providers in Scotland have said a growing pay gap between NHS and social care staff must be addressed to avoid catastrophe in the sector.\n\nThey have warned they cannot pay enough to attract staff to look after Scotland's growing elderly population and keep them out of hospital.\n\nProviders said nurses and carers were leaving for better wages in the NHS and overseas.\n\nScottish ministers said their workforce strategy would address the challenges.\n\nAt the Erskine care home in Edinburgh, Jaclyn Daly from Canberra, Australia works as a care assistant while she studies nursing.\n\nCathy Combe, a resident at the home for military veterans and their spouses, says the staff are all lovely.\n\n\"They do everything for you, and you never have to worry about a thing,\" the 89-year-old says.\n\n\"Before my husband passed on, they were very kind with him. I thought I would have to move when my husband died. But they said, no, you are a widow of the regiment - and that's how I'm still here now.\"\n\nJaclyn is a fourth-year student nurse, who works as a care assistant, but also picks up bank shifts in the NHS.\n\n\"It's hard because when you work in the NHS, the wages are a little bit better, depending on the type of shifts, and the holiday pay that you get compared to here,\" she says.\n\n\"But you've got uncertainty with it. You're not familiar with the area that you might be working in, and you don't know your residents.\"\n\nShe says that in the social care sector \"continuity of care is really important\".\n\n\"It's the little nuances of each resident. It's knowing how they like their tea or their coffee or, for example, a resident who likes to brush his teeth after breakfast.\"\n\nIan Cumming, who runs the Erskine care home charity, says staff deserve to be rewarded for the skills they bring\n\nIndependent companies and charities like Erskine are paid by local authorities to take in residents whose means fall below the threshold to self-fund their own care, under the National Care Home Contract.\n\nIt stipulates that care staff should receive the real Living Wage - \u00a310.90 an hour, as of 1 April.\n\nBut Ian Cumming, who runs Erskine, says this is well below the rate paid to equivalent staff in the NHS and other care homes that are council-run.\n\n\"The NHS and local authority equivalent is 21% higher, moving towards 24% higher [after pay negotiations],\" he says.\n\n\"Ultimately that means \u00a35,000 a year more if you work in the NHS, and that's before you start talking about sick pay, pensions, and additional pay at weekends.\"\n\nHe says care providers cannot compete on that level.\n\n\"We try our very best to make up that shortfall through fundraising,\" he says.\n\n\"People are at the very core of everything we do and our staff deserve to be rewarded for the unique skills that they bring.\"\n\nDemand for staff is strong, with a whole time equivalent (WTE) vacancy rate for NHS nurses (and midwives) at 8.2% as of 31 Dec 2022.\n\nBut data published by the Care Inspectorate in November showed the WTE vacancy rate for nursing staff in care homes for older people stood at 16.2%.\n\nAccording to the Coalition of Care and Support Providers in Scotland (CCPS), the current basic gross salary funded by the Scottish government for an adult support worker is \u00a321,255.\n\nIn the NHS, someone doing the equivalent job is now on \u00a325,468, without taking account of better pensions and other benefits.\n\nRachel Cackett, chief executive officer of the CCPC, says failure to act now to address the pay gap could be \"pretty catastrophic\".\n\nShe thinks NHS staff deserve pay rises, but warns of knock-on effects.\n\n\"The more pay rises we see going into the NHS, the bigger the disparity in pay between a support worker in social care, doing equivalent work to a support worker in the NHS. And that means we've got this really skewed labour market in Scotland, where it's really hard to hold on to people.\"\n\nWhen Jaclyn, 32, is fully qualified, she'll face a choice about which path to take.\n\n\"There is a pay gap and that will come into it. I'm at a fortunate stage with my life that I don't have many bills, I don't have family, so for me, I can go more where my heart leads a little bit,\" she says.\n\n\"But I do know for some of the older girls on my course that have children and more responsibilities, that they will probably follow the money.\n\n\"I guess I'm really privileged in the fact that I'm from Australia and I've got that flexibility to go home. I've got nurses in my family in Australia and they're all telling me to go back, particularly because there has been a whole social care reform in the last couple of years.\"\n\n\"So it's a difficult decision. Scotland has trained me. But you do hear people are going overseas to places like Australia for better conditions and better pay.\"\n\nAnother resident at the Erskine care home, Muriel, says it's important to have staff that know you well.\n\n\"My eyes have been opened to what old age is all about,\" she says. \"It has its moments but it's not wonderful. I have Parkinsons and it's getting worse.\"\n\nIan Cumming believes good care for residents such as 79-year-old Muriel can ultimately reduce strain on the NHS. He says Erskine has a higher bill for staff, because they employ a variety of specialists.\n\n\"We are layering on advanced nurse practitioners, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, all on site to help people to live well and keep out of hospital. Not every care provider can do that, and none of it's funded,\" he says.\n\nThe financial climate means Erskine is running an unsustainable model.\n\n\"We spend \u00a32,000 a week in terms of the staffing ratios, the specialist roles we've got, and the number of activities we have.\n\n\"We can do it because we're a charity, but this year I'm running \u00a36m in the red in order to maintain that and I will be taking that from our reserves,\" Ian adds.\n\nRachel Cackett says many care providers may be forced to hand back contracts - reducing even further the number of care beds available.\n\n\"We need much more laser vision from the Scottish government and pretty much the equivalent of what they're giving to our NHS,\" she adds.\n\nThe CCPS is calling on the new cabinet secretary Michael Matheson to implement an hourly rate of at least \u00a312 an hour for social care staff, and to publish a plan to move towards parity of pay and terms and conditions.\n\nThese issues were due to be at the heart of the design of a new National Care Service - but that legislation has been delayed following concerns about its price tag.\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Social care has felt the impact of Brexit on staffing, restrictions due to the pandemic, and increased costs due to energy prices and inflation and we are grateful to all staff and partners who have been working with us to look at solutions.\n\n\"Extra government funding has already helped deliver two pay rises for staff in two years and we are currently working on improved terms and conditions.\n\n\"Our national workforce strategy looks at how we can plan for, attract, train, employ and nurture our health and social care workforce.\"", "Some motorists are facing waits of more than three months at their closest test centre\n\nSome drivers in Northern Ireland are still struggling to book an MoT despite a record number of tests being carried out in the last six months.\n\nThere has been a backlog since testing was suspended several times in 2020.\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said more than 500,000 tests were conducted in the last six months as part of efforts to cut delays.\n\nBut some drivers trying to book online still face long waits for an appointment.\n\nBetween September last year and the end of February 2023, a total of 506,967 full vehicle tests had been carried out by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA), she added.\n\nThat is a 22% increase on the same period in 2021/2022.\n\n\"This increase in capacity has been achieved by adopting a range of measures including the recruitment of additional vehicle examiners, the use of overtime to provide cover for leave and by offering vehicle test appointments on a Sunday and bank holidays, when testing is not normally available,\" the DfI said.\n\n\"The DVA currently issues reminder notifications six weeks in advance of your MoT expiry date.\n\n\"The DVA will keep this notification period under review as it continues to manage the demand for vehicle testing.\"\n\nThey added that it did not currently hold information to enable it to accurately report the average waiting times for vehicle tests \"given that this position changes on a regular basis\".\n\nBBC News NI logged on to the booking system on Friday to check the current availability.\n\nThe soonest date some MoT centres are offering in Northern Ireland are in June and July\n\nIt appears many motorists are facing two or three-month delays for an MoT, unless a cancellation appears, when using the DVA online system.\n\nAn MoT certificate ensures a vehicle meets legal standards and is required for tax and insurance purposes.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously said it would not penalise drivers whose MoT has expired as long as they met a number of criteria.\n\nThe PSNI told BBC News NI that exemption remains in place.\n\n\"In the event police encounter a vehicle with no current MoT, so long as we can ascertain that a vehicle is roadworthy, has a forthcoming MoT test date and is not sorned (statutory off road notification), then police will not take any further action,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAs for insurers, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said \"where motorists in Northern Ireland have a confirmed MoT appointment booking for their test, they should not be prejudiced by a lack of a valid MoT certificate if it has run out before the test takes place\".\n\nABI said its members had agreed to maintain cover for customers who, \"through no fault of their own\", could not get a test.\n\n\"However, motorists whose MoTs are due must keep trying to book a test with the DVA, even if the date falls after when their MoT certificate expires.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that insurers must keep their vehicle in a roadworthy condition.\n\nDrivers requiring an MoT to tax their vehicle, who cannot get an appointment before their current certificate expires, are asked to \"book the earliest available appointment and keep checking the booking system for an earlier appointment\", according to the DfI.\n\n\"If they get to within five days of the expiry date of their vehicle tax and they have been unable to secure an appointment or their vehicle tax has expired, they should contact the DVA customer services team at dva.customerservices@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk and they will do their best to get an urgent appointment for the vehicle,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nMoT tests in Northern Ireland were first suspended in January 2020 due to safety concerns about equipment being used during the tests.\n\nThen Covid-19 hit, bringing another halt to MoT tests in March 2020.\n\nTesting resumed in stages from June 2020, at a reduced capacity due to social distancing measures, before returning fully in July 2021.\n\nA new online booking system was set up in September 2021 to deal with the backlog that built up from January 2020, but it initially faced technical problems and created further delays.", "Higher bills are expected for Welsh Water's customers, who are already paying the second highest average bill in

discharges are allowed during heavy rainfall to protect people's homes.\n\nMPs heard five of nine Welsh rivers designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) were failing on phosphorus levels and excessive nutrients.\n\nOnly 40% of Welsh rivers meet the criteria for good ecological status. For bathing water, 80% were ranked as excellent.\n\n\"We are going to have to go through a phase of significant bill increases to try and tackle these very important problems,\" said Steve Wilson, managing director of wastewater services for Welsh Water.\n\n\"To have five of the most iconic rivers in Wales, if not the UK, not meeting the right standards is really important.\n\n\"Welsh Water's discharges are accounting for around 20% to 30% of the problem in some of those rivers.\n\n\"We have got to get on top of that and invest in those assets to improve the quality.\"\n\nSewage spills can happen when pumping stations, like this one, overflow - often during heavy rain\n\nWelsh Water said it will spend nearly \u00a31bn over the next five years.\n\nProtecting beaches and tackling storm overflows that cause environmental harm will be the priority, it added.\n\n\"We think it will cost between \u00a314bn and \u00a320bn to get storm overflows in Wales down to spilling 10 or 20 times a year,\" added Mr Wilson.\n\nThat will mean higher bills for Welsh Water's customers, who are already paying \u00a3499 a year - the second highest average bill in Wales and England.\n\nAlun Moseley says he has experienced itching and rashes after being in the sea\n\nAlun Moseley from Port Talbot is a lifeguard and a campaigner for Surfers Against Sewage, and said being in the water played an important part in his mental health.\n\n\"It's the kind of place I come to when I feel sad, happy, when I need to make major decisions, to relax, switch off. It's my go-to place,\" he said.\n\nMr Moseley said he surfed at spots all over Wales and claimed that over the past few years he has fallen ill \"two or three times\" after being in the water, most recently in September.\n\nHe said he believes sewage was the cause.\n\n\"The water was discoloured, bubbling, residue on the beach. You could see stuff floating around that looks like it came from the toilet.\"\n\nMr Moseley, who also works as a surf instructor, said lessons have occasionally had to be cancelled due to sewage discharges.\n\nHe wants to see tougher regulations to tackle the problem.\n\nThe charity Surfers Against Sewage publishes recent spills on an alert map\n\nAlice Hortop, an occupational therapist and a wild swimmer from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said: \"One of my friends' husbands who's a surfer got really ill when he had something he caught, went in his intestines and lingered.\n\n\"We have to keep an eye on the alerts - there's an app you get on your phone - and only three days ago there was an alert that stopped our Llantwit Major swim.\n\n\"You could see all the way along the coast there were different pockets being affected, and they only monitor the water between May and September, but actually people swim and surf all year round.\"\n\nMs Hortop said the alerts are \"usually quite good\", but there was a time recently where the app went down for nearly a week.\n\n\"This is a historical situation that's been left literally to fester for a very long time,\" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\nWelsh Water said many different factors contribute to water quality and wastewater can also come from private systems outside of their control.\n\n\"We do notify Surfers Against Sewage when our assets at bathing waters operate so that they can make people aware through their app,\" a spokesman added.\n\nThe MPs' inquiry also heard from Surfers Against Sewage, which publishes a live map of spills in Wales.\n\nMP Stephen Crabb says he is \"depressed\" about water customers facing higher bills\n\nCommittee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said he felt \"pretty depressed\" for his constituents.\n\n\"They have the prospect of higher bills, but not necessarily a clear plan for reducing sewage discharges,\" he said.\n\nWater regulator NRW said it was proud of the good result for bathing water.\n\nIt said: \"Nevertheless, we are concerned about the impact of storm discharges on our water quality and are taking action to address the issue.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said: \"Ensuring our water is of the highest quality is a vital part of making Wales a prosperous, happy and healthy place to live.\"", "An anti-plastic group has criticised Sainsbury's for swapping its mince out of hard plastic trays into vac packs.\n\nThe supermarket said the change will see 55% less plastic used, after some customers said it turned the mince to mush and was hard to cook with.\n\nCampaign group A Plastic Planet said the vacuum packs will not go in most household recycling collections.\n\nSainsbury's said they could be recycled at stores and customers had to get used to the new look and cook differently.\n\nThe supermarket announced that it was \"the first retailer to vacuum pack all mince, saving 450 tonnes of plastic each year\". It is part of its goal to halve its use of plastic packaging of own brand products by 2025.\n\nBut Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, said: \"While there will be a saving in the weight of plastic used, switching to flexible plastics over rigid ones is no more green than changing from a petrol to a diesel vehicle.\"\n\nShe said soft or flexible plastics were \"almost impossible to recycle, especially where they are food-contaminated\".\n\n\"The old, rigid plastic packaging would at least have gone into recycling, however limited the UK's systems are,\" she added. \"The new vacuum packs will instead be thrown into general waste and end up in incineration.\"\n\nSainsbury's head of fresh food, Richard Crampton, told the BBC the UK was behind Europe and the rest of the world on its use and recyclability of flexible plastics. \"So it's true you can't pick it up at the kerb yet,\" he said.\n\nHe said they had \"exactly the same issue\" with the film that covered the hard plastic trays the mince used to be packaged in.\n\n\"It's the same problem but now there's a lot less plastic,\" Mr Crampton said.\n\n\"Customers can't impact the packaging that we produce,\" he said, but added that Sainsbury's took its responsibility for sustainable packaging \"super seriously\".\n\n\"It's a moral responsibility as well as corporate responsibility - it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nEnvironmental campaign group Wrap said plastic bags and wrapping could be recycled at more than 6,000 places across the UK. It has a recycling locator to find your nearest one.\n\nSome shoppers had posted their dislike of the vac packed mince on social media, and reviews on the Sainsbury's website.\n\nOne said the meat now resembled \"a rectangle of mushed off-cuts\" and another \"someone's kidney\".\n\nMr Crampton said: \"It's exactly the same mince... but more compressed... so we do need customers to cook it slightly differently.\n\n\"It's as straightforward as it just needs more agitation with a wooden spoon to break the product up,\" he said. The new vac packs have cooking instructions on them.\n\nMr Crampton said Sainsbury's had tested the move with chefs and customers and \"didn't get any negative feedback at all\" so felt confident to roll it out across all stores.\n\nHe said the number of complaints they had received were \"fractions of less than a per cent\" and sales and market share had not changed.\n\nAsked if Sainsbury's would consider switching back to the old packaging, he said: \"We always listen to customers but at the moment there's no overwhelming data to tell us to not do this.\"\n\nHe said vac packed meat was common in the EU and US as well as recipe boxes in the UK, and he would not be surprised if other supermarkets followed suit.", "A flooded residential area of Kherson today after the Kakhovka dam was breached Image caption: A flooded residential area of Kherson today after the Kakhovka dam was breached\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken to his counterparts in both Ukraine and Russia, and called for a joint investigation to establish the cause of the breach of the Kakhovka dam.

I always love a challenge and I'm looking forward to the rematch.\n\n\"This isn't how I wanted the homecoming to go but I'm grateful that this event could sell out in a couple of minutes.\"\n\nIn a career brimming full of incredible achievements, Taylor's homecoming will surely go down as one of her most memorable nights, if not her most accomplished performances.\n\nPro boxing in Ireland has been on its knees since a gangland shooting at a weigh-in at the Regency hotel in 2016 effectively ended big-time boxing in the country.\n\nIt was only fitting that potentially Ireland's greatest ever boxer was the one to bring it back.\n\nTaylor waited her entire pro career, 22 fights, to fight at home again and was competing as the challenger for the first time in four years, having stepped up in weight.\n\nCameron had not been afforded any of the trappings of the champion in fight week, her name second on the posters and the Northampton fighter was the first to make her ring walk, breaking from tradition.\n\nMany had wondered whether the occasion would overawe Cameron, but she cut a relaxed figure as Three Little Birds rang out during her ring walk.\n\nThe first glimpse of Taylor promoted the noise to a new level. Cameron, shadow boxing and sharing jokes with her team, turned her back on Taylor's entrance as her challenger finally appeared.\n\nDressed in gold and black like Cameron, Taylor enjoyed an unusually long ring walk, singing as she slowly made her way to the ring.\n\nShe stopped at the ropes to take one last look at the feverish crowd before entering the ring.\n\nCameron had vowed to swarm Taylor from the off and she made good on that promise in the opening round, piling the pressure on her opponent and rarely firing single punches.\n\nThe 2012 Olympic gold medallist was fighting on the back foot, trying to deliver counters as Cameron continued to push the pace brilliantly.\n\nCameron was light on her feet as the aggressor, but the crowd roared whenever Taylor's renowned accuracy shone through.\n\nThe home favourite landed a right-left combination at her trademark lightning speed in the second to huge roars, but those moments of success were fleeting.\n\nCameron came out quickly in the second, producing a lovely combination on the back foot as Taylor moved in.\n\nTaylor was able to respond moments later and was trying to push Cameron back with straight hands, but could not stop the champion pouring forward.\n\nThe partisan crowd would erupt with every punch Taylor landed, no matter how glancing. UFC star Conor McGregor was among those going hoarse at ringside urging Taylor on.\n\nCameron remained dominant, however, and Taylor's hair began to fall out of her plaits as she tried her best to time power-counters.\n\nBut Taylor needed to move at a relentless pace to avoid Cameron.\n\nCameron regularly mixed up head and body shots, and was in control of the contest at the midway point.\n\nBut Taylor's heart is well documented, she has dug deep in fights before and come out on top.\n\nSearching for that spark, Taylor stood in the centre of the ring in the sixth with Cameron, content to box up close, targeting Cameron's head at speed.\n\nBut as she would do throughout the entire fight, Cameron responded with her own heavy shots and never appeared troubled.\n\nThe Briton then enjoyed a stellar seventh round, landing a right hand in the opening seconds and more heavy punches to the body of Taylor.\n\nInto the eighth, and the crowd urged Taylor to stand and fight with Cameron, which she did, before having to eat a sharp uppercut from the champion.\n\nThe eighth bell arrived with both women swinging from the hips.\n\nThe penultimate round saw Taylor desperately trying to wrestle control, but Cameron expertly rode the storm, landing when she could with some smart boxing.\n\nThe two went toe-to-toe again moments later, both lowering their heads, but once again Cameron appeared to come off the better in exchanges and strolled back to her corner confidently for the final instructions.\n\nThe fight's pace barely slowed throughout and Taylor, sensing she needed a big finish, began to step forward first in the final round, punching in threes and fours.\n\nCameron tagged her challenger with short rights as the crowd began to chant \"Katie, Katie\" trying to encourage their fighter, but a last-gasp knockdown never seemed likely as Cameron reached the finish line with ease.\n\nApprehension filled the arena as both fighters' teams celebrated.\n\nThere were several nervous minutes for Cameron and her corner as they awaited the results.\n\nThey would have been forgiven for fearing the worst when the first scorecard was announced as a draw, but there was to be no hometown controversy as Cameron was confirmed a deserved winner.", "A man accused of murdering Metropolitan Police sergeant Matiu Ratana has denied he meant to pull the trigger.\n\nLouis De Zoysa shot Sgt Ratana, 54, the on-duty custody sergeant, at Croydon custody centre on 25 September 2020.\n\nThe defendant, who denies murder, told Northampton Crown Court he had hypermobility, a condition that means it is easier to bend and stretch.\n\nHe admitted he pointed a gun, while he was handcuffed, at Sgt Ratana's chest but denied he meant to shoot him.\n\nThe prosecution alleges Mr De Zoysa, from Banstead in Surrey, \"pulled the trigger on purpose four times\" in a holding room.\n\nLouis De Zoysa used a whiteboard and pen to help him communicate in court\n\nThe jury has heard Mr De Zoysa was hit in the neck by one of the bullets.

We are not going to sit and wait while the fossil fuel industry takes our dreams away from us.\"\n\nAsked if she's worried about the consequences of the trial, she replied: \"I personally am more worried about the horrible harm the fossil fuel industry is doing to the world.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to stop while they are threatening the planet.\"\n\nGreenhouse gases have been pumped into the atmosphere by activities such as burning fuels, which have heated up the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe world has warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial revolution about 200 years ago.\n\nClimate activists around the world have targeted the fossil fuel industry, including the UK group Just Stop Oil which has been disrupting high-profile sports events this summer.\n\nMuch of the oil and gas industry says that continued production is necessary in order to meet global energy demands.\n\nCutting oil and gas production would be \"dangerous and irresponsible\", the head of energy company Shell told BBC News.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal now if governments are serious about the climate crisis.\n\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres recently said investment in new oil and gas production was \"economic and moral madness\".\n\nThis week the world experienced its hottest day on record on Tuesday, topping 17C for the first time.", "A stranded horse stuck down a four metre-deep pit in Lazio, central Italy, had to be pulled to safety by helicopter on Sunday.\n\nFootage released by the Italian fire brigade Vigili del Fuoco shows the dramatic moment the horse is hauled free and taken out of danger.", "Last updated on .From the section England\n\nEarps has made 34 appearances for England since her debut in 2017 Coverage: Live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website & app.Full coverage details; latest news England goalkeeper Mary Earps says it is \"hurtful\" that fans cannot buy a replica of her goalkeeper shirt. The 30-year-old was named the world's top goalkeeper at last year's Fifa Best awards following the Lionesses' win in the European Championship that summer. England's kit for this summer's World Cup is manufactured by Nike. \"Millie [Bright] said 'my niece is desperate to get your shirt, where can I get it?' and I was like, 'you can't',\" Earps said. \"All my team-mates have ordered a lot of shirts for their friends and family. \"They were talking about it at the dinner table, saying 'oh I wasn't able to get this'. And I'm thinking, 'I can't get it at all'. \"There are a lot of people who have spent a tremendous amount of money on outfield shirts and then put a number one and 'Earps' on the back, which doesn't sit well with me either.\" Replicas of Earps' kit with Manchester United, who she plays for in the Women's Super League, sold out last season. It has been reported that producing new women's goalkeeper kits for the public is not part of Nike's commercial strategy. The England home and away shirts are available to buy in men's, women's and children's sizes and retail at \u00a379.95 for an adults and \u00a359.95 for kids. A replica of the men's England goalkeeper shirt is not available on the England Store but is available with other outlets. Earps says she was not told her kit would not be available to the public and only found out when the outfield kit went on sale. From almost quitting football to cover star - Mary Earps \"For my own family and friends and loved ones not to be able to buy my shirt, I know that sounds like 'oh Mary, what a horrible problem', but on a personal level that is really hard,\" Earps added. \"I have been trying to go through the correct channels as much as possible, which is why I have not spoken on it publicly. \"On a personal level, it is hugely hurtful. There has been an incredible rise in goalkeeping participation.\" Earps started every game as the Lionesses won Euro 2022 and became the first goalkeeper to keep 50 clean sheets in the Women's Super League earlier this year. She said she had spoken to her team-mates about the issue and that they were also disappointed by the situation. \"I can't really sugar-coat this in any way, so I am not going to try. It is hugely disappointing and very hurtful,\" she added. Ex-Manchester City stopper Karen Bardsley, who was capped 81 times by England, said she believes the problem is part of a wider issue about goalkeepers being \"undervalued\". \"It has been a common theme for as long as I can remember,\" she told BBC Sport. \"There are only very few moments where my shirt was available in very specific shops and maybe one or two times where it was available online, but very fleeting. \"It speaks of a bigger picture around the position and how well it's valued in the game itself - I think it is massively undervalued.\" BBC Sport has contacted Nike for comment.

In an Instagram video, he also congratulated Muller on her selection.\n\n\"You're in for the most wild, inexplicable ride and I'm chuffed for you,\" he said. \"Have a blast.\"\n\nThe UK's Sam Ryder won the jury vote in last year's contest with his song Space Man\n\nAfter years of dismal results, Ryder turned things around for the UK at the 2022 competition, placing second to Ukraine.\n\nTaP Music management, which has worked with Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey and Ellie Goulding, were the team who selected the TikTok star and his song Space Man for the contest.\n\nThis year, they started with \"a shortlist of 50 or more\" acts, said co-owner Ben Mawson; but when they met Muller, they instantly \"fell in love with her\".\n\n\"We needed someone with a huge amount of charisma and an incredibly strong voice, who can perform flawlessly on the night without making any mistakes,\" added the firm's co-president Anna Neville.\n\n\"Mae is witty, she's funny, We've got so much faith in her. Mae is going to bring it home.\"\n\nSpiky break-up songs are Mae Muller's trademark, and I Wrote A Song is no exception.\n\nOver a polished club beat, she gleefully takes down a cheating ex, listing all the things she wants to do to him - make a scene outside his house, crash his car, generally make his life a misery.\n\nInstead, she goes meta, working out her anger by writing a song about writing a song about him. \"And that's what we call growth, ladies and gentlemen,\" she said in a video introducing the song.\n\nDescribed by one colleague as \"a Bulgarian nightclub banger\" and by my 13-year-old as \"too good for Eurovision\", it's certainly the most contemporary, credible song we've sent to the contest in a long time.\n\nMuller was pictured outside Radio 2 headquarters after being announced as the UK entrant\n\nMae's sassy north London charisma conveys the depth of her contempt, and the singalong chorus is instantly memorable.\n\nThe flourishes of flamenco guitar are more Mi Chico Latino than La Isla Bonita. But still, they're an astute acknowledgment of Europe's influence on a British music industry that too often sees itself as superior.\n\nAs for the song's chances, I'm in two minds. My first reaction to the song was like a cat tasting wasabi: Get this horror show away from me.\n\nIt took a couple of listens to fully embrace Mae's campy insouciance. After 24 hours, I can't get it out of my head - but in Liverpool, she only gets one chance to impress the Eurovision voters.\n\nThe country will be holding its breath to see what they decide.\n\nLike Ryder, Muller will spend the months leading up to the contest promoting her song to outside the UK.\n\n\"There's an extra Eurovision dynamic, which involves going to countries you wouldn't ordinarily go to on a promotional campaign,\" said Mawson.\n\n\"Lots of travel, lots of radio and TV, lots of interviews. It's going to be be a tiring few months for her - but hopefully fun.\"\n\nMuller said she was raring to go. \"I can't wait to see you all. I can't wait to get to Liverpool,\" she posted on TikTok. \"I'm very excited! What is life?\"\n\nMost of the 37 competing countries have confirmed the song and act they will be sending to Liverpool, with a deadline set for 13 March for the handful who have yet to confirm their plans in public.\n\nThere are typically two ways a Eurovision entry is chosen: An internal selection, in which an act is chosen behind the scenes; or a national selection, involving a TV show where the winner gets to fly their country's flag in Liverpool.\n\nThousands of Eurovision fans follow how each country chooses its act with events like Super Saturday gripping devotees across the continent.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The rundown on the 2023 contest in 50 seconds\n\nNormally, the country who wins hosts it the following year but organisers ruled it was too dangerous in Ukraine, following Russia's invasion, so the BBC was asked to host it instead.\n\nEarlier this week, tickets for May's event sold out in 90 minutes, with fans now being warned scammers are targeting their hotel bookings with phishing cyber-attacks.\n\nAll the build-up, insights and analysis is explored each week on a new BBC podcast called Eurovisioncast.\n\nEurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.", "Two men and two boys on a street in Gaza look at a leaflet containing an IDF evacuation warning\n\nEvacuation warnings issued by Israel to people in Gaza ahead of attacks have contained a host of significant errors, BBC analysis has revealed.\n\nWarnings contained contradictory information and sometimes misnamed districts. This made them confusing to Gazans seeking safety.\n\nExperts say such mistakes could violate Israel's international law obligations.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has rejected any assertion the warnings were confusing or contradictory.\n\nIn a statement, it said the alerts analysed by the BBC were only one element of its \"extensive efforts to encourage the evacuation [of] civilians out of harm's way\".\n\nInternational humanitarian law requires attacking forces to give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.\n\nIsrael says its warning system is designed to help civilians flee danger as it continues its war against Hamas. The system divides a map of Gaza into hundreds of numbered blocks.\n\nIsrael has produced an interactive online map of the blocks that geo-locates users, showing their live location and which block number they are in.\n\nThis IDF post from late January shows a social media post on X with a link through via QR code to the master block map.\n\nBut people we spoke to have described struggling to get online to access the system, as well as finding the block system difficult to understand, notwithstanding the errors.\n\nThe BBC analysed the IDF's Arabic language social media channels on Facebook, X and Telegram, where we found hundreds of posts containing warnings. The same warnings were often posted repeatedly.\n\nWe also searched for leafleted warnings which had been photographed and shared online. The IDF says it has dropped 16 million such leaflets over Gaza.\n\nWe have focused our analysis on warnings issued since 1 December, which is when the IDF launched its block system as a way of providing more precise instructions than previously, after coming under international pressure.\n\nWe grouped all of the IDF's posts and leaflets that we found after this date into 26 separate warnings. The vast majority made reference to the master block system.\n\nThe IDF told the BBC it also warned of impending attacks through pre-recorded phone messages and live phone calls. Due to damage to Gaza's phone network we have not been able to compile data on these phone calls.\n\nAnd our analysis of leaflets was limited to those we could find photographed and shared online.\n\nThe 26 separate warnings we found contained specific information from the IDF that people could use to escape areas of danger. But 17 of them also contained errors and inconsistencies.\n\nIn addition, one warning listed neighbourhoods as being in one district when they were actually in another. Another mixed up the block numbers of two neighbourhoods. And in a third, some blocks listed in the text were on the opposite side of Gaza to those highlighted on the accompanying map.\n\nWhen we put these errors to the IDF, it did not respond to the issues we raised with the maps specifically but said the text of posts had been sufficiently clear. It also said that when arrows were used to direct people to safety, \"it is obvious that the arrows point to a general direction\" and reiterated that the key information had been provided in the text.\n\nThese inaccuracies and errors may violate Israel's obligation under international law to provide \"effective advanced warnings\", says Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.\n\nIf the majority of warnings contain errors or are unclear to the point that civilians can't understand them then, she says, \"these warnings do not fulfil the proper function they have under international humanitarian law\".\n\nThis, adds Kubo Macak professor of international law at the University of Exeter, undermines their function to give \"civilians the chance to protect themselves\".\n\nIn December, Saleh, a tech entrepreneur from Gaza City, was sheltering with his children and his in-laws in Nuseirat in central Gaza - where, he says, there was no electricity or phone signal and long periods of internet outage.\n\nHe saw people killed and others fleeing from a nearby school as it was being shelled, but says he had not received any IDF evacuation details.\n\nEventually, he found someone with a Sim card that allowed him to access data networks in Egypt and Israel and came across an evacuation warning on an Israeli government Facebook page.\n\n\"There was an evacuation order for several residential blocks - [but] we didn't know which block we lived in. This led to a big argument,\" Salah says.\n\nSalah could only access the internet intermittently, but he messaged his wife Amani, who has been in the UK since just before the war. She was able to go online and access the IDF's master block map and pinpoint where her husband was. But then, looking back at the specific evacuation warning on Facebook, the couple realised the numbered block where Salah was staying was shown cut in two - adding to the family's confusion.\n\nEventually, Salah decided to leave with the children. But some of his family stayed put - until fighting escalated further.\n\nWhen the BBC analysed the Facebook evacuation warning Salah had been trying to decipher, we found further points of confusion.\n\nIn text, the post urged people to leave blocks 2220, 2221, 2222, 2223, 2224 and 2225 - all blocks that appear in the IDF's online master map.\n\nBut in the accompanying map, the six numbered blocks had been lumped into one, and mislabelled as block 2220.\n\nDespite these inconsistencies, Israel presented its block warning system at the International Court of Justice in January as part of its defence against allegations by South Africa that it is committing genocide.\n\nIsrael's lawyers argued that it was doing its utmost to protect civilians and had \"developed a detailed map so that specific areas can be temporarily evacuated, instead of evacuating entire areas\".\n\nThey presented one social media warning in court as evidence - but the BBC has found two errors in it.\n\nBlock 55 and 99 were listed in the text of the post from 13 December but they were not shaded on the map.\n\nThe IDF told the BBC that when a block number is explicitly mentioned in text, the warning is sufficiently clear.\n\nIsrael's lawyers also claimed that the IDF, via its Arabic Twitter account, was providing information on the location of shelters close to areas being evacuated. But in all of the posts and leaflets we analysed we did not see any warning providing names or exact locations of shelters.\n\nBBC analysis has also found the IDF's block system overall was used inconsistently. Nine of the 26 warnings listed a mix of block numbers and neighbourhood names. Another nine didn't mention block numbers at all. Despite linking through to the online master map, they instead listed neighbourhoods by name - which often sprawled over many numbered blocks.\n\nThe BBC could not find a way to determine the exact blocks of these neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Abdu family, which includes 32 people, also fled Gaza City to central Gaza early in the war. Then, in December, they received a warning leaflet dropped from a plane.\n\nMessages on the family Whatsapp group, which the BBC has seen, chart their confusion as they argued for two days over what the leaflet meant.\n\nIt contained a list of neighbourhoods to evacuate, but the family couldn't locate most of these places.\n\nThe warning asked people to leave \"Al-Bureij Camp and the neighbourhoods of Badr, the North Coast, al-Nuzha, al-Zahra, al-Buraq, al-Rawda, and al-Safa in the areas south of Wadi Gaza.\"\n\nWe located an al-Zahra and a Badr close by, but they are north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed. We could not find the neighbourhoods of al-Rawda or al-Nuzha in the \"areas south of Wadi Gaza\".\n\nThe Abdu family struggled to decide what to do. Should they stay and risk getting caught up in a fierce ground battle - or leave, and abandon the only shelter they might find?\n\nSome followed the warning to go to \"shelters in Deir al-Balah\". But when they arrived they felt unsafe and decided to return. If they were going to die they would die together, they told us.\n\nSatellite data on destruction in Gaza - analysed by Jamon Van Den Hoek at Oregon State University and Corey Scher of City University New York Graduate Center - shows that the area of Deir al-Balah that the family fled to came under more intense attack during this period than the area that they had left.\n\nThe IDF told us it had cross-checked \"data regarding civilian presence and movement that followed these warnings\" and that many people did receive and follow them.\n\nIt said that warnings had \"saved countless civilian lives in the Gaza Strip\".", "Shahd Zorob has had problems recruiting PAs and said doing so was \"demeaning\"\n\nDisabled people are being shut out of society because of a lack of personal assistants, it has been claimed.\n\nDisability Wales said many people with disabilities were being left without the support needed to live as independently as possible.\n\nShahd Zorob, who has cerebral palsy, has had problems recruiting PAs and said the problem was \"demeaning\".\n\nThe Welsh government said it was investing \u00a370m into the pay of social care workers, including PAs.\n\nPAs are usually employed directly by the person who needs them but paid for by the council.\n\nMs Zorob, from Cwmffrwd, Carmarthenshire, employs two of them to help her with personal care, appointments and campaigning.\n\nShe said she advertised for new assistants three years ago, but no-one applied.\n\nThe 30-year-old said PAs should be paid more so disabled people can get the required support.\n\nShe said: \"The money isn't as much as similar jobs in the NHS, so how do you expect people to live?\"\n\nMs Zorob said she has to rely on her mum to help her if a PA isn't available.\n\nShe said the pandemic was a particularly difficult time and the situation was \"really hard\".\n\n\"I wish I could help out and do things but it's really difficult.\n\n\"I am a 30-year-old woman and I am very active. I've got my own life. I do a lot of online events and I'm part of so many groups.\n\n\"I'm one of hundreds with cerebral palsy in Wales and we have been missed all our lives. We don't seem to exist.\"\n\nPA Sian Barlow said the work was not easy but she enjoyed it\n\nSian Barlow is one of Ms Zorob's PAs. She said she loves working with her, but that the work is not easy.\n\n\"It's really rewarding but the pay is pretty terrible across the country,\" she said.\n\n\"The pay reflects the value we all put on it. We don't value the work so the money does not follow.\"\n\nJane Tremlett, cabinet member for health and social services at Carmarthenshire council said local authorities are \"experiencing unprecedented challenges with recruitment across the social care sector\".\n\nShe added: \"We are working with colleagues locally, regionally and nationally to improve upon this position. Examples of this are innovative recruitment campaigns and developing career progression pathways to attract more people into the sector.\"\n\nDisability Wales' disability equality officer, Alex Osborne, said the consequences of too few PAs could be dire.\n\n\"In the best case scenario people aren't able to do as many things,\" she said.\n\n\"But for some disabled people, they're stuck in bed.\n\n\"We've heard of people being left for hours in their bed and even having soiled themselves because a PA hasn't turned up.\"\n\nAlex Osborne said the consequences of too few PAs could be dire\n\nMs Osborne said people were having to fight for direct payments that they were entitled to.\n\n\"People get a lot more lonely if they can't go out and meet people,\" Ms Osborne said.\n\n\"We've seen disabled people being quite worried or put off applying for work.\n\n\"They're feeling stuck in their homes and excluded. Disabled people have always had to fight for direct payments to pay for support to access leisure activities. It's a hard fight.\"\n\nDewis Centre for Independent Living supports people to employ PAs through direct payments.\n\nDirect payments manager for Rhondda Cynon Taf, Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan, Greg Davies, said the vacancy rate was the highest in 15 years.\n\nGreg Davies had not seen the PA vacancy rate as high in 15 years\n\nThe charity supports 1,670 disabled people who employ around 3,200 PAs - but they are still short of assistants by 280.\n\n\"Social care is having to compete with retail and hospitality,\" he said.\n\nThe Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said its research showed PA workforce challenges were \"one of the most significant ongoing risks in social care\".\n\nA spokesman said: \"There remains a need to prioritise and invest in social care and the workforce to ensure that we have a workforce who are truly valued, have parity of esteem with NHS workers, and are appropriately rewarded.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said in 2023 it was investing \u00a370m to ensure social care workers, including PAs, were paid at least the real living wage.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We're taking steps to professionalise the sector, improve the status of social care as a valued career, and ensure there are more opportunities for career progression.\"", "Artificial intelligence (AI) could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs says.\n\nIt could replace a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe but may also mean new jobs and a productivity boom.\n\nAnd it could eventually increase the total annual value of goods and services produced globally by 7%.\n\nGenerative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is \"a major advancement\", the report says.\n\nThe government is keen to promote investment in AI in the UK, which it says will \"ultimately drive productivity across the economy\", and has tried to reassure the public about its impact.\n\n\"We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away,\" Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan told the Sun.\n\nThe report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance, it says.\n\nBBC News has previously reported some artists' concerns AI image generators could harm their employment prospects.\n\n\"The only thing I am sure of is that there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI,\" Carl Benedikt Frey, future of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, told BBC News.\n\n\"What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles.\n\n\"Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work.\n\n\"Consider the introduction of GPS technology and platforms like Uber. Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10% according to our research.\n\n\"The result was lower wages, not fewer drivers.\n\n\"Over the next few years, generative AI is likely to have similar effects on a broader set of creative tasks\".\n\nAccording to research cited by the report, 60% of workers are in occupations that did not exist in 1940.\n\nBut other research suggests technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs.\n\nAnd if generative AI is like previous information-technology advances, the report concludes, it could reduce employment in the near term.\n\nThe long-term impact of AI, however, was highly uncertain, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank Torsten Bell told BBC News, \"so all firm predictions should be taken with a very large pinch of salt\".\n\n\"We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work,\" he said.\n\n\"That's not to say that AI won't disrupt the way we work - but we should focus too on the potential living-standards gains from higher-productivity work and cheaper-to-run services, as well as the risk of falling behind if other firms and economies better adapt to technological change.\"", "HSBC is among several banks inhabiting towers in the Canary Wharf district, east London\n\nHSBC is to move its world headquarters from its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, possibly back to the City of London.\n\nThe banking giant is to move out of 8 Canada Square by 2027 when its current lease expires, after two decades.\n\nThe move is part of plans to downsize its office space following the Covid-19 pandemic, as the bank says it is now committed to flexible working.\n\nHSBC has told the BBC it is negotiating a new lease on BT's former headquarters near St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe proposed new office, in the Panorama St Paul's development, will be much smaller than the bank's current headquarters, which houses about 8,000 staff.\n\nHSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn previously said he thought going to the office five days a week was \"unnecessary\"\n\nHSBC said the new development \"is being designed to promote wellbeing and constructed to best-in-class sustainability standards, using predominantly repurposed materials\".\n\nHSBC moved to Canary Wharf in 2002, having previously been based at sites in the City of London.\n\nHSBC's decision to return to London's historic financial district within the Square mile is a \"huge vote of confidence for the City\", said the City of London Corporation policy chairman, Chris Hayward.\n\n\"This move further solidifies the City's reputation as a prime destination for financial services firms, offering them unparalleled opportunities.\n\nAfter the pandemic, HSBC told staff it was going to reduce office space globally by about 40% to reduce costs and energy and allow more employees to work from home.\n\nChief executive Noel Quinn said he thought going to the office five days a week was \"unnecessary\" and its managers were often travelling to locations around the world during the week.\n\nHSBC told the BBC that talks began into a move to this site after a review into its future location last year.

Watch: Johnson's comments in the Commons on Partygate scandal\n\nBoris Johnson has accepted he misled Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, but denied he did it on purpose.\n\nThe former prime minister has published a 52-page defence of his actions ahead of a grilling by MPs on Wednesday.\n\nIn it, he says his assurances to MPs that lockdown rules had been followed were made in \"good faith\".\n\nMr Johnson faces being suspended or even expelled from Parliament, if MPs decide he deliberately misled them.\n\nA group representing families of Covid victims said his claim to have acted in good faith was \"sickening\", and it was \"obvious\" he deliberately misled MPs.\n\nSince April last year, the Commons Privileges Committee has been investigating whether Mr Johnson initially misled Parliament over what he knew about parties in No 10 during lockdown.\n\nAfter media stories about what would become known as the Partygate scandal emerged in late 2021, Mr Johnson denied to MPs that Covid rules banning socialising indoors had been broken.\n\nBut an inquiry by senior official Sue Gray later found rule-breaking had taken place across multiple events, and police issued fines to 83 people, including Mr Johnson himself, for breaching Covid laws.\n\nThe committee, chaired by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, but with a Tory majority, has previously said Mr Johnson may have misled Parliament on multiple occasions, and evidence suggests rule breaches would have been \"obvious\" to him at the time.\n\nIn his defence document, prepared by his taxpayer-funded legal team, headed by top barrister Lord Pannick KC, Mr Johnson says he had not \"intentionally or recklessly\" misled MPs, and would \"never have dreamed of doing so\".\n\nHe said he believed at the time that events he attended in No 10, including to bid farewell to departing staff, abided by restrictions because they were \"essential for work purposes\".\n\nHe added that it \"remains unclear to me\" why he was fined for attending a gathering in No 10 for his birthday in June 2020.\n\nMr Johnson said he relied on officials to advise him about other events in the building he did not attend, and they did not tell him rules were broken.\n\nHe said that he had \"corrected the record\" in May 2022, on the day Ms Gray's report was published. On that day, he told MPs it was \"not the case\" that rules had always been followed.\n\n\"I believed - and I still believe - that this was the earliest opportunity at which I could make the necessary correction,\" he added.\n\n\"It was not fair or appropriate to give a half-baked account, before the facts had been fully and properly established.\"\n\nBoris Johnson was fined for attending a birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in 2020\n\nThe committee is expected to publish its verdict on Mr Johnson by the summer.\n\nIt has assembled evidence including written statements from 23 witnesses, official diaries, emails between officials, and WhatsApp messages handed over by the former prime minister's legal team.\n\nIt will publish a \"core bundle\" of documents on Wednesday morning, ahead of Mr Johnson's hearing later in the day.\n\nIn his defence document, Mr Johnson claimed the committee had not found evidence he intentionally misled MPs.\n\nHe said the \"only exception\" were assertions made by his former top aide Dominic Cummings, whom he said was \"discredited\" and was motivated by personal animosity.\n\nMr Cummings hit back on Twitter, saying a drinks party in the No 10 garden attended by Mr Johnson had been deemed to have broken the rules by police, with officials fined for attending.\n\nThe committee has published photos of Boris Johnson attending events - including this one in January 2021\n\nIn an interim report published earlier this month, the committee said Mr Johnson's statements to MPs, as well as his performance at Covid press conferences, show that he understood what the rules were.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the committee said Mr Johnson's written submission contained \"no new documentary evidence\".\n\nIn his document, Mr Johnson attacked the conduct of the inquiry, accusing the committee of being \"highly partisan\" and going against precedents set by previous similar inquiries.\n\nThe committee has decided that whether he intended to mislead MPs is not relevant to what it has been charged with investigating: whether it was stopped from doing its job by his statements to MPs.\n\nBut if they find that it was, then his intentions will be considered when deciding any punishment they recommend.\n\nA finding that he deliberately misled MPs is likely to attract the strongest sanction. Another option is they conclude he misled Parliament \"recklessly\".\n\nIn his submission, the former prime minister hit out at this reasoning, saying the idea of misleading MPs recklessly was an \"entirely novel concept\".\n\nThe full House of Commons will have to approve the committee's final recommendations, as well as any sanctions. Conservative MPs will be given a free vote, meaning they will not be told how to vote by party managers.\n\nThe possible punishments range from ordering him to apologise to suspending him from the Commons.\n\nIf he is suspended for more than 10 days, this could trigger a by-election in his constituency - although suspensions of this length have been rare in the past.", "Jodie Comer apologised to her friends and family for being \"absent\" in the past year\n\nJodie Comer says she's \"overwhelmed\" after winning a prestigious Tony Award for her one-woman Broadway show Prima Facie.\n\nThe Killing Eve actress won best leading actress in a play for her portrayal of a defence lawyer who ends up in the witness box.\n\nThe Tony Awards were hosted by Ariana DeBose in New York, but she did not use a script due to the writers strike.\n\nThe ceremony also saw two non-binary actors win prizes for the first time.\n\nIn her acceptance speech for her performance in Prima Facie, Comer said: \"This woman in this play has been my greatest teacher.\n\n\"I have to thank Suzie Miller for that, who wrote this magnificent piece. Without her writing that [I] would not be here so this feels just as much Suzie's as it is mine.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old from Liverpool has previously won an Olivier award for her performance, which transferred from London's West End to Broadway.\n\nLast week, Comer had to leave the stage during a performance due to breathing difficulties as a result of wildfire smoke across North America. The performance was completed by her understudy.\n\nThe actress went on to thank members of her production team and apologised to her friends and family for being \"absent\" in the past year as she worked on the show.\n\n\"To every person who feels represented by Tessa, this has been my greatest honour,\" she said, quickly adding \"and it continues to be - there's three weeks left!\"\n\nSunday's ceremony, which is Broadway's biggest night of the year, was hosted by Oscar-winning actress Ariana DeBose who warned audiences to \"buckle up\" as the show was unscripted, due to the ongoing Hollywood writers strike.\n\nThe show opened with a performance where she flipped through empty pages in a binder labelled \"script\" in a dressing room\n\n\"We don't have a script you guys. I am live and unscripted. You're welcome,\" DeBose said.\n\n\"To anyone who may have thought that last year was a bit unhinged. To them I say 'darlings, buckle up'.\"\n\nSeveral winners, including best leading actress in a musical winner Victoria Clark, referenced the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike during acceptance speeches.\n\n\"We are nothing without our writers and I support the WGA and their struggle for the contract they deserve,\" she said.\n\nAriana DeBose thanked those who had helped put the Tony Awards together, despite the strike\n\nAlso at Sunday's ceremony, Alex Newell and J Harrison Ghee became the first non-binary performers to be recognised at the awards.\n\nNewell won the best featured actor in a musical for Shucked, while J. Harrison Ghee, won best leading actor in a musical for playing a gender-questioning musician in Some Like It Hot.\n\nMichael Arden won his first Tony Award for his direction of the Broadway revival of Parade, which depicts the 1913 trial and imprisonment, and 1915 lynching, of the Jewish-American factory manager Leo Frank in Georgia.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Arden said: \"Parade tells the story of a life that was cut short at the hands of the belief that one group of people is more or less valuable than another and that they might be more deserving of justice.\n\n\"This is a belief that is the core of antisemitism, of white supremacy, of homophobia, of transphobia and intolerance of any kind. We must come together. We must battle this. It is so, so important, or else we are doomed to repeat the horrors of our history.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nOne of the night's biggest awards, best play, went to British writer Sir Tom Stoppard for his play Leopoldstadt, which also scooped best direction, best costume and best performance by an actor in a play.\n\nBritish creatives Tim Hatley and Andrzej Goulding, Tim Lutkin and Carolyn Downing picked up awards for the Life of Pi, with Goulding and Downing referencing Sheffield, where the play had its premiere, in their acceptance speeches.\n\nKimberly Akimbo was named best musical, also scooping best original score and best leading actress for Victoria Clark.\n\nAlex Newell (left) and J Harrison Ghee became the first two non-binary Tony winners\n\nBest performance by an actor in a leading role in a play - Sean Hayes for Good Night, Oscar\n\nBest performance by an actress in a leading role in a play - Jodie Comer for Prima Facie\n\nBest performance by an actor in a leading role in a musical - J.

Raza Ul-Haq Aslam was convicted of robbery.\n\nMuzzaker Shah and brothers Yusuf Jama and Mustaf Jama - the three armed men who went into Universal Express - were convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences.\n\nLeeds Crown Court heard how Khan had spent almost two decades evading justice having escaped to Pakistan shortly after PC Beshenivsky's death.\n\nHe remained there before being arrested by Pakistani authorities in 2020 and was extradited to the UK to face justice last year.\n\nIt's horrible sitting in court watching the last moments of someone's life on CCTV.\n\nWe all know what's about to happen, but Sharon Beshenivsky and Teresa Milburn had no idea.\n\nTheir marked police patrol car can be seen pulling into Morley Street in Bradford one Friday afternoon 18 years ago.\n\nThey were both due off shift in less than half an hour. It was PC Beshenivsky's daughter's fourth birthday. An attack alarm had been activated at a travel agent. They get out of their car and stroll purposefully across the road towards the front door of the building. A second or so later a horrific scene plays out.\n\nPC Beshenivsky is left dying on the pavement and PC Milburn is shot in the chest by three men who burst out of the door firing a pistol.\n\nThe CCTV shows the gunmen sprinting to their getaway car. For Sharon Beshenivsky's family, the clocks stop.\n\nThe man who planned the raid is coolly driving around nearby in the passenger seat of a Mercedes SLK. Moments before the robbery he and an accomplice gave the nod that the coast was clear. And then drove away.\n\nWhat must Piran Ditta Khan have thought when he heard others in the gang had shot two police officers?\n\nHe thought enough to go to ground and flee to Pakistan.\n\nIt took many years to get him back but now he has finally been convicted of killing Sharon Beshenivsky.\n\nThe 75-year-old is likely to die in prison. He can expect a very long sentence for killing a police officer.\n\nSenior Investigating Officer Det Supt Marc Bowes said PC Beshenivsky would \"always be remembered\"\n\nSpeaking outside Leeds Crown Court following Thursday's guilty verdicts, Det Supt Marc Bowes, from West Yorkshire Police, said the force had remained \"doggedly determined\" to bring all of those responsible to justice.\n\n\"Sharon and Teresa went to work that day fully expecting to come home to their families and friends. But due to the horrific actions of those who have now been convicted for those offences, that wasn't the case,\" he said.\n\nDet Supt Bowes added that he wanted to acknowledge the \"respect and dignity\" shown by PC Beshenivsky's family over the past 18 years.\n\n\"I do hope that today's convictions go some way in enabling them to move on with their lives,\" he said.\n\n\"PC Sharon Beshenivsky lost her life in the most horrific of circumstances in the line of duty.

They include two men aged 34 and 36 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, who are being held on suspicion of fraud and computer misuse.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies from 17 countries were involved in the raids, which began at dawn on Tuesday. The operation was led by the FBI in the US and the Dutch National Police, working alongside the NCA in the UK, the Australian Federal Police, and countries across Europe.\n\nGlobally, 200 searches were carried out and 120 people were arrested.\n\nOn Wednesday, anyone logging onto the Genesis website saw a message which read: \"Operation Cookie Monster. This website has been seized.\"\n\nGenesis Market had 80 million sets of credentials and digital fingerprints up for sale, with the NCA calling it \"an enormous enabler of fraud\".\n\n\"For too long criminals have stolen credentials from innocent members of the public,\" Robert Jones, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said.\n\n\"We now want criminals to be afraid that we have their credentials, and they should be,\" he added.\n\nDutch police have launched a portal on their website, where the public can check whether their data has been compromised.\n\nUsers now logging into Genesis see a message saying the website has been seized by the FBI\n\nGenesis Market operated on the open web, not just the dark web.\n\nSet up in 2017, it was notable for its user-friendly, English-language interface.\n\nIt was a one-stop shop for login data that enabled online fraud. Users could buy login information, including passwords, and other pieces of a victim's \"digital fingerprint\", such as their browser history, cookies, autofill form data, IP address and location.\n\nThis allowed fraudsters to log in to bank, email and shopping accounts, re-direct deliveries and even change passwords without raising suspicion.\n\nLogin information on sale included passwords for Facebook, PayPal, Netflix, Amazon, eBay, Uber and Airbnb accounts. Criminals buying the information were even notified by Genesis if the passwords changed.\n\nGenesis provided its customers with a purpose-built browser which would use the stolen data to mimic the victim's computer so it looked as if they were accessing their account using their usual device in their usual location. So the access did not trigger any security alerts.\n\n\"It was a very sophisticated website, very easy to use, with a wiki [website that can be modified or contributed to by users] telling you how to use it, and accessible on the open web and the dark web,\" Mr Jones said.\n\n\"So you didn't need to be a sophisticated cyber actor to get into this. You just needed to be able to use a search engine, and then you could start committing crime.\"\n\nDepending on how much data was available, a victim's information would sell for less than $1, or for hundreds of dollars.\n\nWhile Genesis users were mostly accessing it for fraud, the data on sale could also be used for ransomware attacks - where hackers block access to data and demand payment to release it.\n\nThe individual's data that led to the 2021 hack of gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) sold for just $10.\n\nBusinesses also had their information sold on the website, which facilitated fraud, mobile phone number hacking and ransomware attacks.\n\nWill Lyne, head of cyber intelligence at the NCA, said Genesis was \"an enormous enabler of fraud\" and one of the most significant marketplaces for buying login information.\n\nThe NCA believes there were about two million victims worldwide with tens of thousands of them in the UK.\n\nMany victims would first know something was wrong when they saw fraudulent transactions on their account, or if they were lucky, they got a message saying someone had logged in as them.\n\nTens of thousands of criminals are thought to have been using Genesis, with several hundred users in the UK.\n\nThey could search for potential victims by country, and see what data was available before they made their purchase.\n\nInternet users who want to avoid fraud are advised to keep their computer and phone operating systems up-to-date, to use two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong passwords such as ones involving three random words.\n\nThey are also being urged to consider using a password manager.\n\nHow have you been affected by what's happened?

If they fail to do it, we will have an economic and financial catastrophe that will be of our own making,\" she said.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Sunday Ms Yellen said debt ceiling negotiations should not take place \"with a gun to the head of the American people.\"\n\nBut time is running out for an agreement.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Biden will meet Republican leaders to ask them to agree to raising the current $31.4tn (\u00a325.12tn) limit.\n\nCongress typically ties approval of a higher debt ceiling to stipulations on budget and spending measures.\n\nLast month the House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the ceiling, currently roughly equal to 120% of the country's annual economic output, but included in the bill sweeping spending cuts over the next decade.\n\nPresident Biden wants Congress to agree to raise the debt ceiling, with no conditions. President Biden has said he will not negotiate over the increase and will discuss budget cuts after the issue is resolved.\n\nFailure to find cross-party agreement on the issue could result in a \"constitutional crisis\" Ms Yellen said.\n\nThe Biden administration is considering whether there is scope within the constitution for the president to continue issuing new debt without the approval of Congress, but will this week strive to avoid that scenario.\n\n\"We should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis,\" Ms Yellen told ABC.\n\nThe debt ceiling has been raised, extended or revised 78 times since 1960, often with negotiations going down to the wire.\n\nIn the end, the threat of a default on government payments including debt obligations has always led to compromise. The US has never defaulted, an event that would upend global financial markets and have far-reaching economic impacts.\n\nBut delaying a resolution also had negative consequences, Ms Yellen said in a letter to Congress last week.\n\n\"We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,\" she wrote.", "Scotland could become the first part of the UK to ban egg companies from keeping chickens in cages.\n\nThe Scottish government has announced a new consultation on outlawing the use of cages to house hens involved in egg production.\n\nAgriculture minister Jim Fairlie said if it was implemented Scotland would be \"leading the way in improving the welfare of animals\".\n\nThe use of battery cages for birds was banned in the UK in 2012.\n\nBut there are still more than 1.1m chickens in Scotland kept in \"enriched cages\", which provide birds with more room to nest, roost and scratch than the smaller battery cages.\n\nA survey in 2020 found that almost nine out of 10 people (88%) in the UK believed that using cages in farming was cruel.\n\nAnd more than three quarters (77%) supported a complete ban on their use.\n\nThe Scottish government's preference is for a ban on the installation of new cages from 2033, followed by a complete ban on keeping birds in enriched cages from 2034.\n\nMinisters believe this option \"most effectively balances improvements in bird welfare and ensures sustainability for the laying hen sector\".\n\nBut the consultation also seeks views on banning the use of enriched cages from 2030.\n\nAnd it proposes a non-regulatory option, which would see shops and caterers commit to stop selling and using eggs from birds kept in enriched cages by 2034.\n\nMr Fairlie said the Scottish government's most recent programme for government had included commitments \"to improve the welfare of laying hens to ensure their confinement does not negatively impact their normal behaviours\".\n\nHe added: \"Significant progress has already been made in recognising the importance of animal welfare - both in government policies and the demand from the public in the choice they make when shopping.\n\n\"If implemented, the ban would be another example of Scotland leading the way in improving the welfare of animals by being the first UK nation to ban the practice.\"\n\nThe minister said the European Union had put forward legislation to prohibit using cages for all farmed livestock, with Luxembourg and Austria already banning them and others phasing them out.\n\nAnd he said the Scottish government would also call for evidence, in due course, on the use of cages in the gamebird, quail egg and meat sectors.\n\nMark Borthwick, World Animal Protection policy manager, welcomed the news and said: \"We're pleased to see Scotland leading the way in consulting on the ban of cages for laying hens which are still in use in the UK.\n\n\"Enriched cages for laying hens will be banned in other countries including in Germany in 2025, in Czechia by 2027 and in Slovakia by 2030.\n\n\"France has banned the installation of any new cages.

Pre-season has just begun, and the full season kicks off very soon.\n\n\"It's an exciting time in football. I am grateful for the opportunity to step up and lead such a progressive and forward-thinking club.\"\n\nShe first joined the club in 2019 to take charge of the academy and remains the only woman to manage a men's English Football League academy.\n\nDingley, who was born and raised in Carmarthenshire, also initiated the club's girls academy which launched in 2021.\n\nShe has a Uefa Pro Licence and previously worked at Burton Albion.\n\n\"Hannah was the natural choice for us to be first team interim head coach - she's done a fantastic job leading our academy and is well aligned with the values of the club,\" club chairman Dale Vince said\n\n\"It's perhaps telling for the men's game that in making this appointment on merit, we'll break new ground - and Hannah will be the first female head coach in English [men's] football.\"\n\nThe EFL's head of equality, diversity and inclusion, Dave McArdle, praised the appointment: \"This is a welcome moment for English football and with many highly skilled and experienced coaches across the game it was only a matter of time before the ongoing positive development of female coaches led to an opportunity in the first-team at an EFL club.\n\n\"It has always been a key priority for the EFL to create an environment in which clubs consider qualified candidates from an ever-widening pool of coaching talent and select the best possible person for a role.\n\n\"This represents another step forward as we strive to make our game representative of the communities we serve.\"\n\nWomen in Football's chair Ebru Koksal also tweeted that Dingley had broken \"norms and barriers\".\n\n'More than capable of coaching at a men's level'\n\nDingley spoke to BBC Points West in March about breaking down barriers in the sport.\n\n\"You've got a responsibility as the first to open the doors for others and to encourage others,\" she said.\n\n\"You always say if you don't see it, you're probably not going to be it. The fact that I do this I hope it encourages more females to come into coaching, into football, into different roles. I feel a great responsibility to talk about that.\"\n\nShe said at the time that she did not think it would be long until a woman took charge of a men's professional team.\n\n\"It will come in sooner than you think,\" Dingley said. \"The success that the Lionesses are having, that Emma Hayes is having at Chelsea.\n\n\"There are others, really good female coaches out there who I have more than faith in would be more than capable of coaching at a men's level.\"\n\u2022 None In an emotional interview he opens up about what motivated him despite his very humble origins\n\u2022 None Sue Barker travels the globe to find out", "The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these climate-changing gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in.\n\nThe UK's target is important to meet its commitments under the 2015 Paris climate agreement in which governments agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, in July 2022, the High Court ruled that the government's net zero strategy failed to outline policies that would enable it to meet the target. As a result the government published a new plan.\n\nCurrently, less than 40% of the UK's required emissions reductions are supported by proven policies and sufficient funding, according to the Climate Action Tracker website.\n\nSo, what progress is the government making?\n\nThe government says all of the UK's electricity will come from clean sources by 2035.\n\nThe government is expecting a 40-60% rise in demand for electricity by 2035, for example due to the electrification of transport. This means taking the carbon emissions out of electricity generation is important.\n\nUK governments have been relatively successful in cutting emissions from electricity generation. These fell by 73.4% between 1990 and 2021.\n\nThis is largely due to a substantial reduction in electricity generated from coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel - from 40% in 2012 to less than 2% last year.\n\nThe proportion of electricity generated by renewables has grown to around 40% in the last few years, up from just over 10% a decade ago. Fossil fuels - mainly natural gas - still generate about 40% of UK electricity. The remainder comes from nuclear power and imports.\n\nThe government has set ambitious targets to accelerate the expansion of low carbon energy to reduce reliance on natural gas. These include increasing offshore wind capacity five-fold by 2030 and approving up to eight new nuclear reactors.\n\nA report by the National Audit Office warned that the lack of a clear delivery plan risked the UK not meeting its 2035 carbon-free electricity target. But the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) recently emphasised that it is still possible if delivery is significantly ramped up.\n\nHowever, the government has opened a new licensing round for companies to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea for wider energy production, not limited to electricity. The International Energy Agency warns this would go against climate agreements.\n\nDirect emissions from buildings account for about 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating.\n\nThe government committed to installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 to replace gas boilers. Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, and are three times more efficient than a boiler. The government is offering grants of \u00a35,000 to help homeowners install a heat pump.\n\nHowever, in February 2023, the Lords Climate Change Committee described this scheme as \"seriously failing\". Currently, only 50,000 heat pumps are installed annually, meaning the government's 600,000 target is \"very unlikely to be met\".\n\nInsulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from housing. It prevents the loss of heat, meaning less energy is wasted trying to maintain the house's temperature.\n\nHowever, the UK has some of the least energy-efficient homes in Europe. In June, the CCC said there was a \"shocking gap in policy for better insulated homes\".\n\nIn response, in November 2022 the government announced a new \u00a31bn scheme, called ECO+, to improve insulation in UK homes. This is due to come into effect in April 2023. But critics say it doesn't go far enough.\n\nIn March 2023 the government rebranded it as the Great British Insulation Scheme, to help insulate 300,000 of the poorest performing homes.\n\nTransport accounted for just over a quarter of UK emissions in 2021, making it the largest emitting sector.\n\nThe government says no new petrol and diesel cars will be sold from 2030.\n\nBy 2028, it wants 52% of car sales to be electric. In 2021, 11.6% of car sales were electric. The CCC says that this is ahead of schedule and that the market is \"currently growing well\".\n\nTo meet higher demand, the government wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points by 2030. This represents more than a ten-fold increase from present levels. It has pledged over \u00a3350m to fund charging infrastructure.\n\nIn June 2022, the government announced it was ending grants for electric cars, saying the payment was having \"little effect on rapidly accelerating sales\".\n\nIn March 2022, it pledged \u00a3200m for nearly 1000 new electric and hydrogen buses, and is consulting on an earlier phase-out date of non-zero-emissions buses between 2025 and 2032.\n\nAnd it aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, but the CCC says it needs a clearer plan to achieve this.\n\nIt has promised to double cycling rates from 2013 levels by 2025, and build a \"world-class\" cycling network by 2040. It has spent \u00a3338m on walking and cycling infrastructure in England\n\nFlying makes up about 7% of overall UK emissions, and shipping about 3%.\n\nThe UK published its strategy for delivering net zero aviation by 2050 in July 2022.\n\nIt was criticised for relying too much on technologies such as sustainable fuels and zero emissions aircraft that do not yet exist. It also relies on the development of ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to make up for remaining emissions in 2050.\n\nAs a result, the CCC said that the government should be looking at how to manage demand and not allow it to grow.\n\nThe government has announced \u00a377m of funding to help decarbonise shipping.\n\nAgriculture is the source of 11% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe CCC said emissions from agriculture needed to be cut by 30% between 2019 and 2035.\n\nThis would require eating 20% less meat and dairy by 2030 and shifting land from agriculture to supporting trees and restoring peatlands.\n\nThe CCC criticised the government's food strategy for failing to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace.\n\nThe National Food Strategy independent review shows daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade. The government has been criticised for not pushing for further behavioural change in meat consumption.\n\nIn February 2023, the government released details of its long-awaited environmental land management schemes, replacing the EU common agricultural policy.\n\nTrees and peatlands play important roles in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nUK forest cover is 13%, among the lowest in Europe.\n\nThe government has pledged to end deforestation in the UK by 2030. It has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025.\n\nHowever, annual tree planting has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. In June 2022, the UK forestry body warned that there was \"zero chance\" of the UK meeting its target.\n\nIt is estimated that only around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlands are responsible for 5% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up carbon dioxide.\n\nThe government aims to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland by 2025, and will completely ban the sale of horticultural peat by 2030. However, the CCC warns this does not go far enough.\n\nHydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage.\n\nThe government says it is committed to developing the UK's low carbon hydrogen capabilities and considers it a critical part of energy security and decarbonisation. It wants to have a 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030.\n\nThe industry is in its infancy, and the government admits it will need \"rapid and significant scale-up\" in the coming years.\n\nA recent study warned that hydrogen was less efficient and more expensive for heating homes than alternatives such as heat pumps.\n\nThe government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating by 2026. In March 2023 it announced the first winning projects from the \u00a3240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.\n\nIn December 2022, it launched a consultation on the potential for hydrogen transport.\n\nThe ability to capture carbon before it is released - or take it out of the atmosphere and store it - will be important if the UK is to reach net zero, to balance emissions from the continued limited use of natural gas.\n\nThe government is aiming to capture and store between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.\n\nIn March 2023 it announced the first sites for storing captured carbon, which will be on Teesside.\n\nThe Chancellor recently announced \u00a320bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years. But the technology is still emerging and is expensive.\n\nEmissions from manufacturing and construction represent about 12% of total UK emissions.\n\nThe government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two-thirds by 2035.\n\nIt has awarded \u00a334.8m of funding through the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund to help energy-intensive industries decarbonise, but critics say this is insufficient.\n\nThe government also plans to cap the amount of emissions allowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time.\n\nBut the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries and therefore not reducing their emissions.", "A major multi-agency search is under way for Ausra Plungiene\n\nA major search is under way for a missing woman who was last seen walking her dog.\n\nAusra Plungiene, 56, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, is believed to have left home to walk her dog at about 10:30 BST on Tuesday.\n\nThe alarm was raised shortly before 22:00 when police began a search across Eryri, also known as Snowdonia.\n\nNorth Wales Police said Ms Plungiene's car was found in Rowen, Conwy, early on Wednesday.\n\nIt is believed to still be parked in the same place, in a car park at Bwlch y ddeufaen.\n\nA car believed to be that of Ausra Plungiene was found in a car park near Rowen, Conwy\n\nOfficers said she may have been wearing a dark pink or purple padded jacket, black leggings and blue shoes.\n\nMs Plungiene left home to walk her dog at about 10:30 BST on Tuesday\n\nSupt Owain Llewellyn said: \"We are extremely concerned for Ausra's safety and I am appealing to anyone who may have seen her or has any information on her whereabouts to get in touch.\n\n\"A number of resources were deployed throughout the night to try and find her.

The family said they still don't know who opened fire.\n\nKenan Cooper, the DJ at the party, described Phil Dowdell as \"kind of like the hometown hero\" in the close-knit town of roughly 3,000.\n\nHe was a star athlete on his high school's American football team and had been due to graduate to go to Jacksonville State University on a sports scholarship.\n\nOne of his friends who played with him on the school football team told the BBC: \"Phil to me was an amazing friend. God's got an angel.\"\n\nJacksonville's head coach, Rich Rodriguez, said in a statement on Sunday that Mr Dowdell was \"a great young man with a bright future\".\n\nPhil Dowdell's grandmother, Annette Allen, told the Montgomery Advertiser local newspaper: \"He was a very, very humble child. Never messed with anybody. Always had a smile on his face.\"\n\nHis sports coach at the local high school, Roger McDonald, described him as an outstanding young man.\n\n\"Everybody loved Phil.

If found guilty of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe 24-year-old former Marine was arrested on 12 May after initially being allowed by police to leave the scene of Mr Neely's death.

Spotting treatable cancer early can save lives.\n\nThe test remains very much a \"work in progress\", the researchers, from Oxford University, say, but could increase the number of cancers identified.\n\nOften, patients have symptoms, such as weight loss, with a range of possible causes and require multiple tests and hospital visits.\n\nMore than 350 of those in the study - the biggest of its kind in patients with suspected cancer symptoms - were subsequently diagnosed with cancer, using traditional methods such as scans and biopsies. About:\n\nAlthough not accurate enough to \"rule in or rule out cancer\", the test was really useful for patients lead researcher Prof Mark Middleton told BBC News.\n\n\"The test was 85% accurate in detecting the source of the cancer - and that can be really helpful because so many times it is not immediately obvious when you have got the patient in front of you what test is needed to see whether their symptoms are down to cancer,\" he said.\n\n\"With that prediction from the test, we can decide whether to order a scope or a scan and make sure we are giving the right test the first time.\"\n\nThe findings will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, in Chicago.\n\nThe NHS has also been using the Galleri test, developed by Californian company Grail, in thousands of people without symptoms, to see if it can detect hidden cancers.\n\nInitial results are expected next year - and, if successful, the NHS in England plans to extend the rollout to a further one million people in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe test is particularly good at finding hard-to-spot cancers such as head and neck, bowel, lung, pancreatic, and throat cancers.\n\nDr David Crosby, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"The findings from the study suggest this test could be used to support GPs to make clinical assessments - but much more research is needed, in a larger trial, to see if it could improve GP assessment and ultimately patient outcomes.\"\n\nNHS national director for cancer Prof Peter Johnson said: \"This study is the first step in testing a new way to identify cancer as quickly as possible, being pioneered by the NHS - earlier detection of cancer is vital and this test could help us to catch more cancers at an earlier stage and help save thousands of lives.\"", "A satellite image of the Morozovsk airbase from 2021\n\nUkraine has carried out a drone attack against targets in southern Russia and claims to have destroyed six Russian planes at an airbase in Rostov region.\n\nSecurity sources told BBC Ukrainian eight more aircraft were badly damaged, while 20 service personnel could have been killed or injured.\n\nThe Morozovsk base houses Su-27 and Su-34 aircraft used on the front line in Ukraine, the sources said.\n\nThere has been no word from Russia on reports of an airfield attack.\n\nThe BBC has been unable to independently verify the reports.\n\nHowever, Russian officials said that more than 40 drones had been aimed at the region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nBBC Russian military analyst Pavel Aksyonov says an attack by so many drones over a short space of time could have overwhelmed air defences.\n\nMeanwhile, four people were killed and over 20 wounded in Russian missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nThe eastern city of Kharkiv also came under air attack, with local authorities reporting two deaths from the Russian bombardment.\n\nRussian strikes on Zaporizhzhia injured over 20, according to authorities\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said several high-rise blocks and private homes were damaged.\n\nTwo missiles struck first, and then - after rescuers and police arrived - three more hit, he added.

Ukrainian officials said the town of Chasiv Yar was coming under constant bombardment amid reports that Russian forces had reached the outskirts.\n\nReporting the Rostov attacks, the Russian defence ministry said Saratov, Kursk, Belgorod and Krasnodar regions had also been targeted.

Twelve people were reported injured.", "This is only one in a series of legal claims being brought by Prince Harry against newspaper groups\n\nThe court documents revealed by the Duke of Sussex's latest phone-hacking claim against the tabloid press have sent out a volley of unanswered questions.\n\nAnd that is less than ideal for the Royal Family, who might have wanted these days to be smoothed out like a red carpet in the run-up to the Coronation.\n\nFor instance, what was the purpose of Prince Harry in revealing that his brother, the Prince of Wales, had reached a private settlement with the publishers of the Sun and the former News of the World?\n\nIt has been claimed in some places - not least on social media - that it was an attempt to undermine Prince William, and by extension the wider Royal Family, at a time when they were hoping to build up a more positive public mood.\n\nBut that is very much not the intention, according to sources close to Prince Harry, who is said to be following events in the High Court in London by video link from the US.\n\nFrom Prince Harry's perspective, the reason for unveiling Prince William's deal was a purely defensive measure, a \"shield not a sword\", as a necessary piece of evidence to stop the newspaper group from closing down Harry's claim on the grounds of it being out of time.\n\nWhile the publishers, News Group Newspapers, might say that these claims should have been brought years ago, highlighting Prince William's settlement in 2020 provides proof there were still relatively recent negotiations and pay-outs taking place.\n\nPrince William's spokesman has declined to comment on an \"ongoing legal process\". But if there was a \"very large sum\" paid in a settlement, it would raise further questions of what happened to the money. For instance, did this go to charity?\n\nMore questions are raised by another key part of the argument against throwing out this case for being out of time - in what Prince Harry's court documents call the \"secret agreement\".\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William will both be at the coronation\n\nThis is claimed as a deal between palace officials and News Group Newspapers in which cases involving the royals would be dealt with after other cases had been settled, to avoid embarrassing court appearances or hacking evidence being put into the public domain.\n\nPrince Harry says he was \"kept out of the loop\" about this, not least because it \"would have infuriated me and I would have insisted that I be allowed to take action, especially given my extremely difficult relationship with the press at that time\".\n\nFrom Prince Harry's perspective this is a smoking gun, which meant that he couldn't bring his case until hundreds of others had been settled.\n\nFrom the perspective of the newspaper publishers this is a gun that didn't smoke because it never existed.\n\n\"There was no such secret agreement,\" said the lawyers for News Group Newspapers, rejecting such claims as being \"without merit in fact or in law\".\n\nThe newspaper group also suggests Prince Harry must have known about reports of hacking at a much earlier stage, having been at the \"epicentre\" of the story, and they argue he could have acted sooner.\n\nPreparations are being made for crowds at the coronation on 6 May\n\nBut Prince Harry's version of events, and his assertions that his father the King discouraged his legal action, raise wider questions about the press and the Royal Family.\n\nThe relationship is depicted by Prince Harry as an uncomfortable trade-off, with the royals wanting to keep the press \"onside\" because they were \"incredibly nervous\" about the potential for public embarrassment if a royal had to go into a witness box or if an intercepted voicemail had been revealed.\n\nBut sources close to Prince William reject claims that any settlement could be seen as a sign of a cosy deal with the press.\n\nHe's had his own privacy battles for himself and his family, including over photographs of his wife Catherine, and striking a deal could be a pragmatic way to draw a line under a legal claim.\n\nIt was Prince William who helped to establish that phone-hacking was taking place back in 2005.\n\nBut there are so many loose threads raised by this case and there are no signs that Prince Harry will desist from pulling on them to see what unravels.\n\nIt's also hard to know how these legal battles will go down with the public. They might warm to an underdog. Journalists usually talk about \"the press\" as though it's someone else, not themselves, perhaps in recognition of our own lack of popularity.\n\nIn terms of the question of what's driving Prince Harry, sources point to a specific part of his witness statement and it doesn't sound like he's planning to settle. It seems more likely that he will soon be appearing in court as a witness, which would probably horrify the palace.\n\n\"What I complain of here is about illegal or unlawful activities, and that is something which I feel incredibly strongly about, not just in a personal capacity but as part of the role I have always taken on, in terms of my duty to stand against things which are unjust,\" Harry writes.\n\nHe seems furiously motivated by the impact of hacking and press hounding - including for his mother Princess Diana, saying it had intruded on \"every area of my life\" and had been like a \"third party\" in his relationships.\n\nThe use of hacking to obtain stories was \"disgusting, immoral and a complete abuse of power\", he writes in his court statement.\n\nA judge will have to decide whether this current claim can go ahead to a full trial. But there's already another case against another newspaper group lined up for the days following the coronation and two other claims in progress.\n\nThere are going to be more difficult questions.", "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\n\nRafael Nadal will miss the French Open for the first time in 19 years after a hip injury ruled out the record 14-time men's singles champion.\n\nThe 36-year-old Spaniard, who has won 22 major titles, also said he plans to retire after the 2024 season.\n\n\"I didn't make the decision, my body made the decision.

The Championships, which Nadal won in 2008 and 2010, start at the All England Club on 3 July and run until 16 July.\n\n\"I will stop for a while, maybe one month and a half, maybe two months, maybe three months or maybe four months. I don't know. I do not like to predict the future,\" he said.\n\n\"I will do the right thing for my body and personal happiness.\n\n\"My goal and ambition is to try to stop and give myself an opportunity to enjoy the next year.\n\n\"That is my idea but I can't say 100% it will be like this. My idea is to try to enjoy and say goodbye to all the tournaments that have been important for me.\"\n\nNadal injured his hip during a second-round defeat by American Mackenzie MacDonald in Melbourne and initially expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks.\n\nAn MRI scan two days after the match showed a tear in his left psoas muscle.\n\nLast month, Nadal announced he would not be able to play the Madrid Open because the injury \"still hadn't healed\" and was planning a different course of treatment.\n\nThen he withdrew from this month's Italian Open - another important clay-court tournament before the French Open - saying he had still not been able to train at a high level.\n\nOn Thursday, he announced he will miss Roland Garros for the first time in his career in a news conference at his academy in Majorca.\n\nNadal won the French Open title in his first appearance there in 2005, going on to triumph another 13 times in the following 17 years.\n\nNo player has won as many singles titles at one major tournament as the Spaniard has at Roland Garros.\n\n\"We will really miss seeing Rafael Nadal, whose destiny is closely linked with that of Roland-Garros.\n\n\"I can only imagine the pain and sadness he must be feeling after having to make such a hard decision.\n\n\"We hope to see him at Roland-Garros next year.\"\n\nBy missing the French Open for the first time since 2004, Nadal hopes he might just be in a position to win a 15th title in Paris this time next year.\n\nHe very much wants to be in Melbourne, Indian Wells, Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Paris, Wimbledon and New York next year to say goodbye. But you just know he will also very much hope he can win these tournaments for one last time.\n\nIt is, however, not very encouraging to hear him say no solution has yet been found to his hip problem.\n\nAnd when he admitted pain has prevented him from enjoying both practice and competition in recent years, it reminded me of Andy Murray, who took his own break from the sport - and surgery in his case - to improve, above all else, his quality of life.\n\nTennis has been adjusting to the loss of Serena Williams and Roger Federer.

The number of weather-related disasters has increased five-fold over the same period, according to the WMO.\n\nThe developing countries that have seen improvements in measures to protect human life are home to the populations most vulnerable to such disasters, says the WMO.\n\nIt wants high quality early warnings of impending disasters to reach everyone on the planet by the end of 2027 and it is hoping to accelerate the establishment of these systems during the World Meteorological Conference which begins today in Geneva.\n\nThe WMO reports 11,778 disasters between 1970 and 2021 in its updated Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes.\n\nBangladesh's Shahpori island was one of the areas affected by Cyclone Mocha earlier this month\n\nNine out of ten of the two million deaths those disasters caused were in developing countries.\n\n\"The most vulnerable communities unfortunately bear the brunt of weather, climate and water-related hazards,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.\n\nHe used the example of Cyclone Mocha, the tropical storm which hit parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh last week.

SpaceX launch: How it really went... in 59 seconds\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight.\n\nNo-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time.\n\nAfter two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges.\n\nMr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months.\n\nSpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to \"test early and often\" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight.\n\n\"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months,\" Mr Musk tweeted.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses rocket launches in the US, said it would oversee a mishap investigation. A spokesman said this was standard practice when a vehicle was lost in flight.\n\nWith the vehicle out of control, the flight had to be terminated\n\nThe entrepreneur had tried to temper expectations before the launch. Just getting the vehicle off the ground and not destroying the launch pad infrastructure would be considered \"a win\", he said.\n\nHis wish was granted. Starship cleared its launch complex on the US-Mexico border and picked up pace as it headed out over the Gulf of Mexico. But it was evident within a minute or so that not everything was going to plan.\n\nElon Musk (front centre) watched the launch from the Texas control room\n\nAs the rocket climbed higher and higher, it could be seen that six of the 33 engines at the base of the vehicle had been shut down or had flamed out.\n\nAnd three minutes into the flight, it was pretty obvious the end was near. When the two halves of the vehicle should have been separating, they were in fact still connected - and veering off course.\n\nAt launch-plus-four-minutes, as Starship was losing altitude, a large explosion ripped across the blue sky, the result of computers triggering the vehicle's Flight Termination System (FTS).\n\n\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,\" SpaceX said in a statement.\n\nStarship reached a maximum altitude over the Gulf of 39km\n\nThe top segment of Starship, also known as the ship, had taken flight previously on short hops, but this was the first time it had launched with its lower-stage.\n\nThis immense booster, called simply Super Heavy, was fired while clamped to its launch mount in February. However, its cluster of engines on that occasion were throttled back to half their capability.\n\nIf, as promised, SpaceX went for 90% thrust on Thursday, the stage should have delivered something close to 70 meganewtons.\n\nThat's double the thrust put out by the Saturn V rocket that famously sent men to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nStarship may not have destroyed its launch pad but later pictures indicated the forceful departure had done a fair amount of damage to concrete surfaces.\n\nThe plan for the mission had been to send the ship on one near-complete revolution of the Earth, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific, a couple of hundred km north of Hawaii.\n\nThere was no expectation that the ship or Super Heavy would be recovered. However, long term, this is the plan. The idea is to land both halves, refuel them and launch again - over and over.\n\nIf this can be achieved, it will be transformative.\n\nStarship has a prospective payload performance to orbit of more than 100 tonnes per flight. When this is allied to the low cost of operation - principally, just the cost of fuel - it should open the door to an exciting future.\n\n\"In the industry, there's certainly a very high expectation at the potential of this vehicle for disruption,\" said space consultant Carissa Bryce Christensen.\n\n\"Its massive capacity, from a commercial standpoint, could be significant. A very large vehicle that's human-rated could be important for the emergence of space tourism. The other element is the vehicle being inexpensive. So, you've got a vehicle with two transformational aspects - massive capacity and, potentially, at a very low price,\" the CEO of BryceTech told BBC News.\n\nArtwork: Nasa has given SpaceX $3bn for a Human Landing System based on Starship\n\nThe entrepreneur will initially use Starship to launch thousands more satellites for his broadband internet constellation in the sky - Starlink.\n\nOnly when engineers are confident in the vehicle's reliability will they permit people to fly on the rocket.\n\nThe first mission has already been lined up. It will be commanded by billionaire US businessman and fast-jet pilot Jared Isaacman. He's already flown to space in a SpaceX Dragon capsule.\n\nThe first flight around the Moon will be conducted by Japanese retail fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. He will take eight artists with him as part of his DearMoon project.\n\nThe US space agency, Nasa, wants to use a version of Starship to land its astronauts on the Moon's surface.", "For almost two decades James Nutley's parents have lived with unanswered questions over his disappearance\n\nThe parents of a man who has been missing for almost 19 years say they hope renewed interest in the case could finally bring them answers.\n\nJames Nutley, 25, disappeared while on a golfing trip in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, on 24 October 2004.\n\nAfter visiting three pubs he was captured on CCTV near the Giltar Hotel where he was staying at 23:57, but what happened after that remains a mystery.\n\n\"It is hanging over you all the time,\" said his father Jeffrey.\n\n\"We were thinking 'he'll turn up in a day or two' - 20 years later we're still thinking 'where is he?'.\"\n\nJames's parents Catherine and Jeffrey Nutley said they had not given up hope of one day being reunited with their son\n\nAt the time of his disappearance, James was living at the family home in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, with his parents and sister.\n\nHis parents do not believe he would have taken his own life, saying their \"golf-mad\" son seemed very happy and had been working his \"dream job\" demonstrating golf clubs.\n\nCatherine recalled her son excitedly rushing out of the house to leave for the trip with no idea of what was to come.\n\nShe first realised something was wrong when her sister and a friend came to see her at work.\n\n\"My sister said 'James has gone missing in Tenby',\" she recalled.\n\nJames was captured on CCTV shortly before he vanished\n\n\"That was it, get your things, come home, Jeffrey had had the phone call as well and he was in a bit of a state.\"\n\nShe immediately headed for Tenby, with Jeffrey staying at home by the landline in case James called.\n\nBy the time she arrived the search was well under way.\n\n\"I think we were just numbed,\" she said.\n\nCatherine was told James' possessions - including his driving licence - had been found on the seaside town's South Beach.\n\nJames was on a golfing trip when he went missing in Tenby\n\nThe police search eventually went cold and there have been few breakthroughs over the years.\n\nOver the past 19 years the family have faced the agony of numerous false leads and even a false murder confession.\n\nJames's parents said he was happy and content and work before he went missing\n\n\"We just had a phone call\u2026.

According to a biography of Ms Sturgeon by David Torrance they first met in 1988 at an SNP youth weekend and became a couple in 2003.\n\nThey never had children but Ms Sturgeon later revealed the painful experience of suffering a miscarriage when she was 40, shortly before the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election campaign.\n\n\"Sometimes... having a baby just doesn't happen - no matter how much we might want it to,\" she said.\n\nPeter Murrell and Nicola Sturgeon were married in 2010 in Glasgow\n\nThe powerful couple would be seen together at party conferences, outside polling stations and at official events such as the Queen's Jubilee concert. But while relaxed in each other's company, they were not gushy hand-holders who lingered before a gathered media.\n\nOn occasions when asked about her husband - notably during her appearance on ITV's Loose Women - Ms Sturgeon was quick to credit Mr Murrell for his cooking skills.\n\nShe has also given insight into how he has supported her political leadership. Ms Sturgeon told the Sunday Times: \"One of the things I value is that he's happy with me having the public role... He's not one of those guys who would feel threatened by it. He doesn't have that sort of ego, he's very self-assured.\"\n\nMr Murrell has similarly spoken of his respect for his wife's intellect, saying: \"She's very, very sharp and on top of whatever the issue of the day is. That spark is always there. We are constantly having conversations that I'm amazed by.\"\n\nIt clearly suited the FM's husband to be in the background but he, and his role as chief executive, came under scrutiny during the inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of complaints against former first minister Alex Salmond.\n\nAt the Holyrood Inquiry in 2020, Mr Murrell denied plotting against Mr Salmond. But opposition MSPs believed that Mr Murrell contradicted himself, and Ms Sturgeon, over some of the details he gave in evidence.\n\nHe was pressed repeatedly about whether the meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond were SNP business, as the first minister had insisted, or government business - which would need to be officially recorded.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell the SNP was an election winning machine\n\nMr Murrell was back in the media spotlight in December last year when it was confirmed he had given a loan of \u00a3107,620 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issues.\n\nThe SNP had repaid about half of the money by October of that year and the party's official line was that the loan was a \"personal contribution made by the chief executive to assist with cash flow after the Holyrood election\".\n\nThese questions were difficult ones for Ms Sturgeon and she had to awkwardly bat away media probes about what she knew of her husband's financial situation - \"that is for him,\" she said at an FM's update at the beginning of the year.\n\nDespite this discomfort she continued to lead the country and he continued to be in charge of the party machine.\n\nBut then Ms Sturgeon announced her decision to resign. Some commentators said it would be inevitable that Mr Murrell would also have to go but his departure has happened before his wife's.\n\nPressure mounted on him when two of the three candidates vying to be new party leader and first minister publicly questioned the contest they were taking part in.\n\nFrom the outset, contender Ash Regan said Mr Murrell's position as SNP chief executive was a \"clear conflict of interest\".\n\nAnd this theme would not go away with another candidate, Kate Forbes, questioning the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nWhat led the chief executive to go was linked to a row about party membership and who would be voting in this election.\n\nOne point of pride for Mr Murrell had been his campaign to increase followers after the failed Scottish independence referendum of 2014 and the coronation of his wife as leader and first minister.\n\nThe SNP went from a membership of less than 25,000 in 2013 to more than 125,000 by December 2019.\n\nBut that figure has fallen back to 72,000 and the party only reluctantly confirmed this when media and opposition pressure, plus questions from all three candidates, became too much.\n\nThe power couple who helped shaped Scottish politics in the first two decades of this century are no more - Mr Murrell is now gone and his wife will soon follow.", "Lucy Spraggan, now 31, has told how she was sexually assaulted by a hotel porter during the X Factor 2012\n\nFormer X Factor contestant Lucy Spraggan has revealed she was raped by a hotel porter during the production of the ITV show in 2012.\n\nShe withdrew from the show, citing an illness at the time, but told the Guardian the real reason was because she was attacked.\n\nSpraggan said she felt let down by the programme makers.\n\nSimon Cowell, creator of X Factor, said what happened to Spraggan was \"horrific and heart-breaking\".\n\n\"When I was given the opportunity to speak to Lucy, I was able to personally tell her how sorry I was about everything she has been through.\n\n\"Lucy is one of the most authentic, talented and brave people I have ever met.\"\n\nSpraggan, who was 20 at the time, said the assault happened after a night out in central London celebrating the 25th birthday of fellow contestant Rylan Clark.\n\nIn her new memoir, Process: Finding My Way Through, the 31-year-old waives the right to anonymity granted to victims of sexual offences to tell her story for the first time.\n\nShe said she was escorted back to the hotel by a member of the production team when a hotel porter offered to take her to her room.\n\nShe told the Guardian: \"I woke up the next day with this sense of sheer dread.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever felt that level of confusion since. I knew that I'd been raped, but I could not process that.

But when will they be able to use them in the war?\n\nWestern allies are set to announce their plans to train Ukrainian pilots to fly US-made F-16s when they meet in Brussels today. But it's still not clear which countries will be willing to provide the jets, how many, or even when.\n\nSupplying Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets will \"not be a silver bullet\" or a \"quick fix\", says the head of Norway's Air Force. Maj Gen Rolf Folland says it'll take time for Ukraine to develop the ability to operate Western jets with complex weapons.\n\nWe meet at a large allied air exercise taking place over Norway, Finland and Sweden. It involves 150 fighter planes - many more than the entire Ukrainian Air Force.\n\nGen Folland says the training is about dominating the skies - to avoid what he calls the type of \"old fashioned\" conflict now taking place in Ukraine.\n\nTo gain supremacy of the air requires a level of scale and sophistication that Ukraine will not be able to replicate. Even providing a small fleet of F-16s could prove a major challenge.\n\nIt took Pulse, a Belgian pilot, three years to master his F-16 fighter. We've been asked to use his call sign, not his real name.\n\nHe shows us round his F-16, originally designed in the late 1970s, long before he was born.\n\n\"It flies like a dream\", he says. \"But flying is the easiest part. The rest is more difficult.\"\n\nFlying is the easy part. The rest is more difficult\n\nThat includes learning to operate the F-16's radar, sensors and weapons. Ukraine, which currently has more pilots than aircraft, is hoping to compress that training into months.\n\nPulse sees the logic of providing Western jets to Ukraine. He points to his F-16's weapons: air-to-air missiles to destroy enemy aircraft, and bombs to hit targets on the ground. \"That's important,\" says Pulse, \"because you can use any weapons from Nato stocks with this jet.\"\n\nBut then there's the question of maintaining the jets.\n\nThe Norwegian Air Force, like others in Europe, has transitioned to the more modern F-35. So in theory there should be F-16s available for Ukraine.\n\nAt Orland air base they use two of their old F-16s to train aircraft engineers. That can take a year - even longer for a senior aircraft technician.\n\n\"You can't just hand over a fighter aircraft and say off you go!\" Col Martin Tesli, the base commander and a former F-16 pilot, says.\n\nHe says there's a large logistical tail - spare parts, software and weapons. But he too understands the need to modernise Ukraine's fleet of old Soviet-era jets.\n\n\"At a certain point, if they're not provided with another aircraft, they won't have an air force to defend themselves.\"\n\nYou can't just hand over a fighter aircraft and say off you go!\n\nJustin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine would probably need the help of Western contractors to keep any F-16s flying. The obvious question, is what country is willing to accept the obvious risks of putting their own people on the ground?\n\nProfessor Bronk adds that Russia is only more likely to target Ukraine's air bases if it's supplied with Western jets. That's a danger for the single engine F-16, which has a large intake that can suck up debris from the runway.\n\nThese are good reasons why the US has, for so long, resisted pressure from Ukraine to provide F-16s. It's less about fears of escalation, and more about the practicalities of operating and maintaining the jets. The Pentagon has warned it'll be both complex and costly.\n\nUkraine has pleaded for Western fighter jets since the war began\n\nNor is providing Ukraine with Western fighters likely to significantly alter the battle on the ground.\n\nLt Col Neils Van Hussen, a former F-16 pilot of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, says \"not a single weapons system will change a big war\". F-16s, he believes, would simply give Ukraine \"the ability to sustain what they're doing now\".\n\nThe reality of this war is that even Russia, with its sizeable air force, has not been able to dominate the skies.

He says there is no one solution for the problem, and nor will it be solved overnight, but that cooperation with allies, including France is very important.

He wanted membership of the world's most powerful military alliance to be a beacon of hope for his people, the ultimate peace dividend that could ensure that never again would Russian troops despoil the Ukrainian homeland.\n\nInstead, Mr Zelensky was simply told Ukraine would be invited to become a member \"when allies agree and conditions are met\". So far, so noncommittal.\n\nNot surprisingly Ukraine's president hit the roof, saying it was \"absurd\" for Nato leaders not to give even so much as a timetable. The conditions, he said, were \"vague\".\n\nAnd he was furious at the idea that somehow Ukraine's membership of Nato would somehow be a bargaining chip for post-war negotiations with Russia.\n\nBut once President Zelensky met Nato leaders face-to-face, the diplomatic dust settled. They fell over themselves on Wednesday to assure him that things had changed, that Ukraine would join Nato.\n\nUK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the country belonged in the alliance. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said they met as equals on Wednesday, but would do so as allies in the future. And President Joe Biden - who had done so much to limit what Nato said officially about potential membership - told Mr Zelensky that it was going to happen. Ukraine, he said, was moving in the right direction.\n\nUK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the summit showed there was now a cultural acceptance that Ukraine belonged in Nato. He said that there were no longer any countries asking \"if\" Ukraine should join, only \"when\".\n\nThat is a lot of warm words for Mr Zelensky to take home to Kyiv in his summit goodie bag.\n\nAdded to that are several other tangible gains: a promise that the process of applying to join Nato will be curtailed, the creation of a new Nato-Ukraine Council which Kyiv can use to summon meetings of the alliance, and, perhaps most significantly, the promise of new, long-term security guarantees made by some of the world's biggest powers.\n\nG7 leaders said they would agree a package of new bilateral assurances of military and economic support for Ukraine, to deter Russian aggression before it joins Nato. That will include more air defences, long-range missiles and even warplanes, as well as more training, intelligence sharing and help with cyber technology. Mr Zelensky called this \"a significant security victory\".\n\nThe one discordant note came from Ben Wallace, who gave a briefing to reporters warning Ukraine it should show more gratitude for the support it has already given.\n\nThis was not a fit of undiplomatic pique, but rather candid advice from a supportive ally. He was saying that Ukraine should do more to understand better the political pressures constraining countries giving them military aid, especially the United States. Turning up in Washington with a shopping list of weapons, treating the US like a branch of Amazon, was, he said, inevitably going to cause a few \"grumbles\".\n\nNot surprisingly this caused a bit of stir in Vilnius.\n\nThe remarks were certainly undiplomatic at a summit designed to demonstrate Nato unity. Rishi Sunak had to disown them publicly, insisting Ukraine had always been grateful. And when Mr Zelensky was asked about the remarks at his own press conference, he looked puzzled and asked his own defence secretary - sitting the stalls - to ring Mr Wallace to find out what he meant.\n\nAll this will prompt some headlines that Nato - and the British government - might regret.\n\nBut perhaps Mr Wallace has unwittingly shone a spotlight on an interesting moment in this war.\n\nFor almost a year-and-a-half, Ukraine's demands have been heard and largely acted upon in western capitals. Kyiv has always been unsatisfied, it has always asked for more, and eventually the west has delivered - from shoulder mounted missiles, to armoured vehicles, to main battle tanks, and now even to cluster munitions.\n\nYet in Vilnius, no meant no. Nato - led by the United States - did not give in to Ukraine's demands and chose strategic caution over an automatic fast-track to membership of the alliance.\n\nSo for President Zelensky, perhaps a diplomatic reality check, that domestic political pressures are beginning to bite in the West and that will shape the global political environment in which he must now operate.

The stage was won by Dutchman Wout Poels as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard maintained his 10-second lead on Tadej Pogacar. Sepp Kuss, Vingegaard's Team Jumbo-Visma team-mate, had his handlebars knocked by a fan holding out a phone. Kuss went down with team-mate Nathan van Hooydonck and brought down a large group in the peloton. \"There was a narrowing in the town and a spectator in the road, and I guess he just clipped my handlebars,\" said Kuss. \"Luckily I'm OK and hopefully the other guys in the crash are all right. It's not ideal. \"I think it's fatigue. It's been such a hard race and everybody is a bit tired. You lose a bit of alertness and there's always things out of your control as well.\" All the riders who crashed completed the 179km stage from Les Gets les Portes du Soleil to Saint-Gervais Mont-Blanc. Dane Vingegaard was unaffected, while stage winner Poels was in the breakaway several minutes up the road. 'Please pay attention to the riders' Shortly after the incident, the official Tour Twitter account posted a slow-motion video of a rider ducking under a spectator's outstretched arm with the message: \"Please pay attention to the riders.\" Jumbo-Visma tweeted: \"Please be always aware when watching cycling at the side of the road.\" Team Confidis said: \"Please be careful. So that the party remains a party for the runners but also for you. You don't need a cell phone to create mind-blowing memories.\" Ineos Grenadiers said: \"If you are spectating at this amazing event, please give the riders room to race.\" The crash took place with about 50km into the stage One of the Tour's worst crashes involving a spectator occurred in 2021, when a woman holding a sign with a message in German to her grandparents clipped rider Tony Martin on the first stage. Two riders pulled out and eight others were treated for injuries, including Spain's Marc Soler, who broke both arms. The woman turned herself in to police and went to court over the incident. She was ordered to pay a symbolic one euro fine but, after receiving a barrage of abuse, her identity was withheld. A the time, Tour director Christian Prudhomme said: \"We just want people to take care when they come to the Tour and remember they are there to see the champions - and not to get on television.\" 'We've seen this before' - analysis Following 2021's 'Omi & Opi' scandal, in which a young woman caused a huge pile-up on stage one of the Tour, riders have been more wary of fans wanting to get close to the action. Cycling's world governing body the UCI introduced a range of measures under the SafeR banner just before this race, which incorporates better assessments of high-speed descents following the death of Gino Mader last month, and more management of crowds. At the top of the Col de Joux Plane climb on Saturday, Pogacar was held up by motorbikes and penned in by crowds standing inches from their heroes. Across a season, the list of rider casualties is too long, but road cycling is a unique sport, growing in popularity, and trades on the volatility of competing out in the open. Poels' stage win was his first in a Grand Tour, with the Team Bahrain Victorious rider finishing two minutes eight seconds ahead of Wout van Aert and Mathieu Burgaudeau in third. Vingegaard finished alongside Pogacar six minutes and four seconds behind Poels. Despite attacking inside the final kilometre of the 7km climb to the finish, Slovenian Pogacar, riding for UAE Team Emirates, could not open up a gap on Vingegaard. Monday is a rest day, before the 21-stage race resumes with a 22.4km time trial from Passy to Combloux on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Watch all episodes of We Hunt Together on BBC iPlayer\n\u2022 None Can you crack the code to open the safe?

From above, you could see fire.\"\n\nFlights were briefly suspended from Vnukovo Airport, southwest of the city centre, and incoming planes were redirected to other airports.\n\nIn a statement, the defence ministry said the \"attempted terrorist attack\" had been \"thwarted\".\n\nMoscow, located about 500km (310 miles) from the Ukrainian border, has rarely been targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nBut Russia has accused Ukraine of launching a series of drone strikes on its territory in recent months, including several on the capital.\n\nThe most notable was in May, when Russia claimed Ukraine used two drones to attack the Kremlin - the heart of the city. Ukraine denied attacking the Kremlin or targeting President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia's defence ministry says Ukraine also carried out an overnight drone attack on Crimea - territory which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Officials say 16 drones were destroyed and a further nine were suppressed, Tass news agency reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials say a Russian missile attack on the city of Sumy, in the north east of the country, has left one person dead and five injured.\n\nA building was destroyed in an explosion at about 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT), according to public broadcaster Suspilne.\n\nOfficials also say two people were killed in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Saturday.", "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it has reached an agreement with Ukraine on funding worth $15.6bn (\u00a312.8bn).\n\nThe organisation's first loan to a country at war is expected to be approved in the coming weeks.\n\nIt would also be one of the largest financing packages Ukraine has received since Russia's invasion.\n\nThe IMF recently changed a rule to allow loans to countries facing \"exceptionally high uncertainty\".\n\n\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to have a devastating impact on the economy: activity contracted by 30 percent in 2022, a large share of the capital stock has been destroyed, and poverty levels have climbed,\" IMF official Gavin Gray said in a statement.\n\n\"The programme has been designed in line with the new fund's policy on lending under exceptionally high uncertainty, and strong financing assurances are expected from donors, including the G7 and EU.\"\n\nMr Gray also said the agreement would \"mobilise large-scale concessional financing\" for Ukraine from international donors and partners, without giving further details. The funding still needs to be approved by the IMF's executive board.\n\nThe IMF expects Ukraine's economy to record a slight contraction or growth this year.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the funding would help the country \"finance all critical expenditure and ensure macroeconomic stability and strengthen our interaction with other international partners\".\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who made a surprise visit to Ukraine last month, said: \"An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF programme is critical to underpin Ukraine's reform efforts.\"\n\nThe US is the IMF's largest shareholder and the biggest contributor to Ukraine in terms of money spent.\n\nEarlier this year, President Joe Biden announced nearly half a billion more dollars of US military aid to Ukraine. This was on top of the $112bn spent by Congress in 2022 alone.\n\nMilitary aid, which accounts for more than half of US spending on Ukraine, pays for drones, tanks, missiles and other munitions systems as well as training, logistics and intelligence support.\n\nMoney has continued to pour into the conflict from all over the world since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February.\n\nLast week, the IMF said its executive board had approved a rule change to allow funding for countries facing \"exceptionally high uncertainty\".\n\nWithout mentioning Ukraine, it said the measure applied to countries experiencing \"exogenous shocks that are beyond the control of country authorities and the reach of their economic policies\".", "A new BBC Spotlight investigation examines the extent of Stakeknife's activities\n\nThe man suspected of being one of the British Army's top agents within the IRA admitted in 1990 that he had shot dead a suspected informer.\n\nThe detail has been uncovered in a court document during a BBC Spotlight investigation into his activities.\n\nFreddie Scappaticci, who died in April, had always denied that he was the agent given the codename Stakeknife.\n\nStakeknife is thought to have been linked to more than 20 murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nBy 1990 Freddie Scappaticci had become the IRA's chief spy catcher within its internal security unit.\n\nIt was known as the \"nutting squad\" because the informers it uncovered were shot in the head - the nut - and their bodies were dumped after interrogations involving torture.\n\nIn February 1989 Joe Fenton was shot dead after being interrogated by the IRA's internal security unit in a house in west Belfast.\n\nNo-one has ever been charged with his murder.\n\nFreddie Scappaticci (back left) was prominent within the republican movement\n\nSeveral months later, another suspected informer Sandy Lynch was brought to the same property to be interrogated by Freddie Scappaticci and others.\n\nSpotlight has spoken to Gerard Hodgins, a former IRA prisoner, who was also one of the individuals in the house where Sandy Lynch was being held.\n\n\"I had no idea that his name was Sandy Lynch at this time - we were just told to go to a house and babysit, the guy was an informer,\" he told the programme.\n\nHowever, unlike many suspected informers within the IRA's ranks, Sandy Lynch survived after the police raided the property.\n\nBy then Freddie Scappaticci had already left the house but he had left something behind - fingerprints on the battery of an anti-bugging device.\n\nA police fingerprint expert said he was certain that the imprint was made by \"Frederick Scappaticci\".\n\nTo avoid arrest Freddie Scappaticci went on the run to the Republic of Ireland for a time.\n\nGerard Hodgins had his conviction quashed after information was withheld from prosecutors\n\nWarning: The following section contains descriptions of violence that some people may find upsetting\n\nSandy Lynch, who was a police informer, went on to give evidence in court before he entered a protection programme.\n\nAs part of his court deposition he detailed the IRA interrogation he was subjected to, including how he was stripped, blindfolded, tied up and taunted for hours by his interrogators.\n\n\"One of them told me that he enjoyed his work and that he would break me,\" he said.\n\nIn his deposition Sandy Lynch also made detailed references to Freddie Scappaticci.\n\n\"He said that I would wake up hung upside down in a cowshed and he would talk to me the way that he wanted to talk to me, that he would skin me alive and that no one would hear me squealing.\"\n\nSpotlight's Jennifer O'Leary has spoken to high-profile figures within republicanism as part of her investigation\n\nThe body of Joe Fenton had been left in an alleyway just metres from the house where Sandy Lynch was being interrogated.\n\nSandy Lynch's deposition also included graphic remarks that he said Freddie Scappaticci had made about the manner of Joe Fenton's death.\n\nHe said: \"[Freddie Scappaticci] tapped me two or three times on the back of my head and said: 'You'll get it right there... like that bastard Fenton.'\n\n\"He said that he had done it.\"\n\nBut it seems that Freddie Scappaticci was untouchable because by the time he was arrested it was in connection with his fingerprint and he had already concocted a false alibi.\n\nGerard Hodgins is one of eight people whose convictions in relation to the Sandy Lynch episode were later quashed after it emerged that crucial information had been withheld from prosecuting authorities.\n\nEx-prisoner Anthony McIntyre says IRA leaders were aware in the early 1990s of the extent of his informing\n\nIn the wake of the Sandy Lynch episode Freddie Scappaticci's position in the IRA was beginning to wane.\n\nThose at the top of the IRA know exactly when they cast their spy catcher into the cold but Freddie Scappaticci did not meet the same end brutally exacted on others.\n\n\"The IRA leadership's reason for not executing Freddie Scappaticci back in 1990, in my view, was a result of a need to save their own skin,\" former IRA prisoner Anthony McIntyre told the programme.\n\n\"The IRA were keenly aware that every interaction they had with Freddie Scappaticci - every order they give to kill, every order they give to kidnap, every order they give to interrogate or torture, Freddie Scappaticci had passed that onto the British and also that Freddie Scappaticci may have recorded this and that they were in deep, serious trouble.\"\n\nOperation Kenova, a multi-million pounds criminal investigation into the activities of Stakeknife, is being conducted by Jon Boutcher, a former chief constable of Bedfordshire Police.\n\nLast month Mr Boutcher announced that Freddie Scappaticci had died.\n\nOperation Kenova has been running since 2016 and its report may shine a light on details long kept in the dark about the activities of agent Stakeknife, including what was known about the interrogation of suspected informers before they occurred.\n\nSolicitor Kevin Winters represents the families of several of those killed by Freddie Scappaticci's IRA unit.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It is due to be cancelled for five weeks from 5 April.\n\nDarren Taylor, chief executive of South Uist community company St\u00f2ras Uibhist, said the island's community was in a state of shock at the plan.\n\nHe said: \"We have had ongoing problems for a very long time with CalMac but this is absolutely beyond the pale. It's outrageous.\"\n\nMr Taylor said the cancellation of the Lochboisdale service would come at the start of the tourist season, with the island's tourism industry still trying to recover from the Covid pandemic.\n\nSt\u00f2ras Uibhist chairwoman Mary Schmoller said the situation amounted to \"staggering incompetence\".\n\nShe said islanders had been warning of the impacts of ferry disruption on island life for years.\n\n\"Food doesn't arrive on time so you are not sure that you are going to find anything in the shops, and you cannot make short time decisions to just go off and visit your

have been planning their wedding for more than two years\n\nFor the islands of Coll and Tiree in the Inner Hebrides, the switch from the winter timetable to the summer one and its more frequent sailings has been delayed by a month.\n\nThis has hit islanders Jane Ham and Graham Griffiths' wedding plans.\n\nThey have been preparing their big day in Glasgow on Saturday 8 April for more than two years, and specifically picked a date to avoid the winter timetable.\n\nMs Ham said: \"It now means guests who were due to come off Coll on the Friday have had to either rebook on an earlier ferry, which hasn't been possible in all cases, or it means an extra night or two nights' accommodation.\n\n\"There are some guests who cannot leave their jobs early to get off for the wedding so, at the moment, it looks like they cannot come.\"\n\nRuth MacEwen, a community councillor on Muck in the Small Isles, said her island faced losing a Saturday service because a ferry was to be redeployed to another route.\n\nShe said: \"Our community is completely dismayed and frustrated.\n\n\"Saturday is the most important day of the week for the Small Isles islands, with it being changeover day for visitor accommodation for many businesses.\n\n\"We are highly concerned for our visitors whom have booked their holiday cottage, booked their ferry, and now have no means of getting here.\"\n\nIn Holyrood on Thursday, Transport Minister Kevin Stewart said Transport Scotland was confident CalMac was doing everything possible to bring ferries back into service from overhauls, and was also highlighting to customers where there was capacity on other routes.\n\nHe said: \"We recognise the real challenges being faced and regret the disruption this is causing to island communities.\n\n\"It is very important to note islands remain open for business.\"\n\nTransport Scotland said the Scottish government had invested more than \u00a32bn it ferry services since 2007, and had outlined plans

It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom.\n\nAnd it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\".\n\nShell said last year it would close all its service stations in Russia\n\nSince then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east.\n\nShell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin.\n\nBut it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nNovatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget.\n\nOleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine.\n\n\"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\"\n\nA spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate.\n\n\"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\"\n\nShell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year.\n\nRussia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe.\n\nThe UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts.\n\n\"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading. Targeting Putin's energy income cannot be about symbolic measures but must concretely put a stop to the huge fossil fuel sums that cement his power,\" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness.\n\nThe France-based energy company TotalEnergies is a minority shareholder in the Yamal project, and was also a major trader in Russian LNG, the Global Witness analysis reported.\n\nThe BBC has approached TotalEnergies for comment.", "Nepali guide Gelje Sherpa found a Malaysian climber shivering and clutching a rope in the area of Mount Everest called the \"death zone\", where temperatures can dip to -30C.\n\nHe carried the climber down from 8,500m above sea level over the course of six hours.\n\nNepali tourism official Bigyan Koirala said it was \"almost impossible to rescue climbers at that altitude\" and that it was a \"very rare operation\".", "Jair Bolsonaro said his mobile phone and that of his wife had been seized during the raid\n\nPolice have searched the home of former President Jair Bolsonaro in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, as part of an investigation into his Covid vaccination records.\n\nPolice suspect the ex-leader's vaccination record was forged so he could gain entry to the US.\n\nOfficers seized the mobile phone of the former president and that of his wife and arrested some of his close aides as part of the operation.\n\nThe former president is a vocal opponent of Covid vaccinations, who repeatedly spread false information about the vaccine and its alleged side effects.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He was relieved of his duties because of mounting corruption allegations against him.\n\nLater that year he was sentenced to six years in jail in connection with corruption at the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Prosecutors said he took $13.5m (\u00a310.2m) in bribes.\n\nHe was released from prison in November but Ecuadorian authorities then issued another arrest warrant alleging further allegations of corruption, triggering Glas to seek refuge in the Mexican embassy.\n\nOn Friday, Mexico said it had granted Glas political asylum \"after a thorough analysis\" of the situation - an action Ecuador viewed as illegal.\n\n\"Ecuador is a sovereign nation and we are not going to allow any criminal to stay free,\" Ecuador's Presidency said in a statement.\n\nIt said Glas, who had been \"sentenced to imprisonment by the Ecuadoran justice system\", had been arrested and \"placed under the orders of the competent authorities\".\n\nPhotographs from the scene show police scaling a wall and metal fence at the embassy's closed entrance.\n\nMexico's Mr Obrador, writing on X, said he had ordered the immediate suspension of diplomatic ties as a result.\n\n\"Police from Ecuador forcibly entered our embassy and detained the former vice-president of that country who was a refugee and processing asylum due to the persecution and harassment he faces.\n\n\"This is a flagrant violation of international law and the sovereignty of Mexico.\"\n\nHours later, Nicaragua also cut off diplomatic ties with Ecuador as a result of the \"unusual and reprehensible action\", a government statement quoted by AFP said.\n\nA number of diplomats were injured in the incident, according to Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's secretary of foreign relations.\n\nTension between Mexico and Ecuador has been mounting in recent days.

But that is not a sentiment shared by all in parliament.\n\nThe author of the first no-confidence votes, Charles de Courson, said removing the government was \"the only way of stopping the social and political crisis in this country\".\n\nHowever the leader of France's conservative Republican party, \u00c9ric Ciotti, said last week they would not support the no-confidence motions.\n\nMr Ciotti said the decision to invoke the clause was \"a result of many years of political failures\" that demonstrated \"a profound crisis in our constitution\", but he did not believe the vote of no-confidence was the solution.", "Thousands of junior doctors led by the British Medical Association will strike over four days\n\nThe government and doctors' unions must call in conciliation service Acas for talks ahead of the \"extremely worrying\" strikes this week, a health chief says.\n\nJunior doctors in England will stage a four-day walkout from Tuesday - potentially the most disruptive in NHS history.\n\nThe NHS Confederation's Matthew Taylor told the BBC some 350,000 appointments and operations could be cancelled.\n\nThe strike is part of a bitter pay dispute and follows action last month.\n\nThe British Medical Association wants a 35% pay rise for junior doctors. It says the increase would make up for 15 years of below-inflation wage rises which has caused a recruitment and retention crisis.\n\nHealth Secretary Steve Barclay said on Saturday the demand was \"unrealistic\" and out of step with pay settlements in other parts of the public sector, but the BMA said Mr Barclay was yet to put a serious offer on the table.\n\nThe strike involving thousands of doctors is due to take place from 07:00 BST on Tuesday until 07:00 on Saturday, with walkouts across both planned and emergency care.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Taylor, whose body represents health service trusts, said the government and unions needed to call in mediators to help advance the talks.\n\n\"It's depressing that there seems to be no movement at all from the two sides of this dispute over the last few days,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\n\"We should consider asking the government and the trade unions to call in Acas, the conciliation service, to provide some basis for negotiations, because if anything the positions seem to have hardened over the last couple of days.\"\n\nHe said an intervention from the public body was needed to avoid further strikes.\n\nMr Taylor also described the impact of thousands of junior doctors striking as \"enormous\".\n\n\"Those services are stretched and there's no question there will be a risk to patient safety, there will be a risk to patient dignity because we're unable to provide the kind of care we want.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's an extremely worrying situation...

In March 2022, a call for written evidence resulted in more than 150 responses.\n\nAmong those to give evidence include England men's Test captain Ben Stokes, women's captain Heather Knight, former men's captain Joe Root, World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan, and Azeem Rafiq - the former Yorkshire player and racism whistleblower.\n\u2022 None Read the full report from the ICEC (warning - contains descriptions of racism and other offensive and discriminatory language and behaviour)\n\nIn a damning 317-page report called Holding Up A Mirror To Cricket, the ICEC concluded that:\n\u2022 None \"Structural and institutional racism\" continues to exist within the game.\n\u2022 None Women are treated as \"subordinate\" to men at all levels of the sport.\n\u2022 None There is a prevalence of \"elitism and class-based discrimination\" in cricket.\n\u2022 None Black cricket has been failed and the ECB must develop a plan to revive it.\n\u2022 None Many who experience discrimination do not report it because of a distrust in the authorities.\n\u2022 None Umpires regularly ignore abuse and dismiss complaints in both the professional and recreational games.\n\n\"There remains a stark reality that cricket is not a 'game for everyone' and it is absolutely essential that the work required to achieve that ambition must begin immediately,\" wrote ICEC chair Cindy Butts.\n\n\"Be in no doubt, what is needed now is leadership. I very much hope that the recommendations we make in this report will be adopted and driven forward by the ECB and all others in leadership positions.\"\n\nThe report praised the ECB for being \"brave\" enough to open itself to independent scrutiny.\n\nThompson, who became ECB chair last September, offered an \"unreserved\" apology.\n\n\"Cricket should be a game for everyone, and we know that this has not always been the case,\" he said. \"Powerful conclusions within the report also highlight that for too long women and black people were neglected. We are truly sorry for this.\n\n\"This report makes clear that historic structures and systems have failed to prevent discrimination, and highlights the pain and exclusion this has caused.\n\n\"I am determined that this wake-up call for cricket in England and Wales should not be wasted. We will use this moment to demonstrate that it is a game for all and we have a duty to put this right for current and future generations.\"\n\nThe recommendations also include the equalisation of match fees between the England women's and men's teams with immediate effect, that the ECB reports on the state of equity in cricket every three years and the removal of annual fixtures between Eton and Harrow schools and Oxford and Cambridge universities from Lord's.\n\u2022 None You've got to be lucky or privileged to play men's cricket - Flintoff\n\nIn light of allegations made by former Yorkshire spin bowler Rafiq, the ECB published a plan to tackle racism and all forms of discrimination in November 2021.\n\nThe ICEC said the significant response it received to its call for evidence was propelled by Rafiq's appearance at a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing in the same month, when he said English cricket was \"institutionally racist\".\n\nOf the respondents, 50% described experiencing discrimination during the course of the previous five years. The figures were higher for people from ethnically diverse communities: 87% of people with Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, 82% of people with Indian heritage and 75% of all black respondents.\n\n\"The persistence of interpersonal and structural racism in cricket is due, we believe, in part to a failure by the ECB to specifically and unambiguously name racism as a concern, at least until the recent crisis (and only then generally in reference to interpersonal and overt forms of racism),\" said the report.\n\n\"Racism remains a widespread and serious problem in cricket across England and Wales and something that the ECB and the wider game should address with urgency.\"\n\nIn its evidence to the report, the ECB admitted to a \"lost generation\" of black cricketers.\n\n\"Black adults are not playing cricket in sufficient numbers to even be picked up by surveys that measure participation in cricket,\" said the ICEC report.\n\n\"A 2020 report by Sport England found that black participation was so low as to be statistically irrelevant, apparently lower than in golf and tennis.\"\n\nThe ICEC has recommended that the ECB undertakes an \"in-depth examination\" of the decline in cricket among black communities within the next 12 months.\n\nIn a statement, Rafiq said: \"I welcome the report's findings and acknowledge the extraordinary work that has been put into this inquiry.\n\n\"There is no doubt now that the game we all love has suffered from institutionalised discrimination, including racism.\n\n\"This report is an opportunity to fully reflect on what has happened and for the sport's governing structures to work out a way forward to ensure that cricket is a game for everyone and that they feel supported, no matter their background.\"\n\nThough the report recognised \"positive strides\" made in the women's game, it also highlighted a lack of female representation among decision-makers, less media exposure and fewer opportunities to play at premier grounds for elite women, and inequity in terms of kit and equipment available to women and girls.\n\nThe ICEC heard \"evidence of a widespread culture of sexism and misogyny\" and examples of men making unwanted and uninvited advances towards women.\n\nThe report was alarmed that England's women have never played a Test at Lord's, while the \"home of cricket\" continues to host an annual schools fixture between Eton and Harrow.\n\nMarylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord's, said it was \"committed to playing its part\" in improving inclusivity in cricket and ensuring Lord's is \"a place where everyone feels welcome\".\n\nIn terms of pay and investment, the women's game receives an \"embarrassingly small amount\" when compared to the men's game.\n\nAccording to the report, an England women's white-ball player receives a salary that is 20.6% that of her male equivalent and the allowance given to the women's captain is 31% that of the men's.\n\nDomestically, the average salary of a woman in the regional structure is 45% that of a man at a first-class county, while in The Hundred the highest salary tier for women is \u00a31,250 more than the lowest tier for men.\n\nEven when players are excluded, there is an 18.8% gap in the average salary between female and male employees at the ECB.\n\nThe ICEC has recommended a \"fundamental overhaul of the professional women players' pay structure\".\n\nThis includes immediate parity between men's and women's international match fees, overall equal pay at international level by 2030 and equal pay in The Hundred in 2025.\n\nA lack of cricket in state schools and a talent pathway structurally aligned to private schools is partly to blame for \"elitism and class-based discrimination\", according to the report.\n\nSome 58% of men to play for England in 2021 were privately educated, significantly higher than the 7% of the general population who went to private school.\n\nTo highlight the overrepresentation of privately educated people in the game, 42% of respondents to the ICEC's own survey went to a private school.\n\nThe report also referenced the costs associated in participating in talent pathways and \"conflicts of interests and biases\" from coaches as further barriers to player progression.\n\n\"The structure and operation of the talent pathway remains a barrier to equity and inclusion across gender, class and race,\" said the report. \"It repeats and reinforces wider structural inequalities that exist across cricket in England and Wales.\"\n\nThe ICEC recommends that inter-county cricket should not begin before the age of 14 and all access to a county talent pathway programme should be free of charge by 2025.\n\n\"We recommend that the entire talent pathway structure should be overhauled to make it more meritocratic, inclusive, accountable, transparent and consistent,\" said the report.\n\nAnti-racism charity Kick It Out \"commended the victims\" and said \"cricket has a mountain to climb\" to \"address the extensive issues that currently exist in the game\".\n\nIt added: \"We look forward to seeing how much resource the ECB dedicates to driving systemic change at international, county and grassroots level. It will require hard work, innovation and courage.\"\n\nYorkshire, which admitted four amended charges stemming from Rafiq's claims of racism at the club, said in a statement: \"Yorkshire County Cricket Club has seen first-hand the damage that can be caused by a failure to tackle discrimination of all kinds, and the vital need to cut it off at source.\n\n\"The creation of an inclusive environment for all can only be achieved through collaboration at all levels of the game. \"\n\u2022 None Is it time more of us bought an electric car?: Panorama investigates why there are so few electric cars on the UK's roads\n\u2022 None Is it a good idea to fix your mortgage and energy bills?:", "Pavel Kuzin was killed in Bakhmut amid brutal fighting around the eastern Ukrainian city\n\nStaff sergeant Pavel Kuzin took his position at the machine gun - the only soldier still able to fight. Everyone else in his troop lay dead or injured.\n\nSuffering from shell-shock and with one arm bandaged, the 37-year-old fired at the waves of Russian soldiers trying to storm his position. They didn't even try to take cover, but simply walked towards him across the open field.\n\nIt was clear Pavel wouldn't be able to hold the position for long, but he needed to buy time for a rescue team to arrive. His final action in life was to ensure his wounded comrades got to safety.\n\nThe Ukrainian military says Bakhmut is now the scene of many \"unprecedentedly bloody\" battles like this, where they now have to repel up to 50 attacks on their positions every day. Russia has concentrated massive forces in this area, and their brutal strategy of launching human wave attacks helps them to advance slowly - but at a very high cost.\n\nPavel was in charge of a forward observation group that consisted of six Ukrainian soldiers. On 17 February, shortly after the start of their watch, they came under heavy fire. A tank began hammering their position.\n\nUnlike relentless mortar rounds, the tank's aiming was chillingly accurate. Shells were landing a few metres from their trenches. Two soldiers were wounded and Pavel told them to go into a dugout. A combat medic went down to tend to their injuries and prepare them for an evacuation. Moments later, the wooden shelter was directly hit by a shell.\n\n\"There was a bright flash,\" one of the wounded soldiers with a callsign Tsygan told the BBC. \"I was thrown onto the logs with such force that it nearly crushed me. I couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive. Someone was shouting, it seemed the sound was coming from 100m away.\"\n\nI couldn't understand whether I was dead or alive\n\nIt was Pavel's voice who was checking on them. The other soldier was half-buried under dirt and logs. He was dead.\n\nTsygan could barely move and Pavel had to drag him up over the splintered logs that blocked the way. It was painfully slow to move Tsygan just a few metres away into a nearby trench. When the shelling paused briefly, Pavel went back trying to find others.\n\nTwo minesweepers arrived to clear the logs and find the bodies. But yet another shell hit the dug out, killing one of the men and injuring the other. The tank kept firing.\n\nAt that moment, Russian troops started storming their position. Pavel called for a support group to evacuate the wounded and rushed back to his Browning machine gun to stop the Russian infantry.\n\nThe 206th Battalion in which Pavel served had fought in the southern Kherson and north-eastern Kharkiv regions. But the battles over Bakhmut were very different from what they had seen before.\n\n\"The intensity of fighting to break through our positions was shocking,\" says Mykola Hlabets, platoon commander. \"Sometimes, [Russian soldiers] would get as close as 20 metres from us, crawling and moving under a treeline or across an open field. This is where we had our first gunfights at such proximity.\"\n\n\"They would just stand and walk towards our positions without any cover. We wiped out one group after another, but they kept coming.\"\n\nHlabets described them as a suicide squad. Others call them cannon fodder.\n\nUkrainians are trying to fight off Russia's human wave attacks - similar to tactics used during World War One\n\nA number of videos have been shared on telegram channels recently where newly mobilized Russian soldiers appealed to President Vladimir Putin and the authorities to stop what they called \"illegal orders\" to send them \"to be slaughtered\".\n\nLast month mobilised soldiers from Belgorod posted a video saying that they were sent for an assault mission without proper training. After suffering heavy losses, they said they refused to carry out their orders.\n\nOften these poorly trained soldiers are reportedly forced to keep pushing forward. The assault group Storm of the 5th Brigade of the Russian army said in a video appeal that they couldn't leave their position because of zagryad otryad, or blocking troops - detachments that open fire at their own men who try to retreat.\n\nThese wave attacks are similar to World War One tactics, when troops charged the enemy and engaged in close combat. And despite their lack of training and experience, sending newly recruited soldiers to such assaults are bringing some results for Russia, albeit at a very high cost.\n\nUkrainians expose their positions when they open fire to stop those attacks. That allows Russian artillery to identify the target and destroy it, as happened with Pavel's post.\n\nAlso, soldiers at forward positions run out of ammunition while trying to repel numerous wave attacks. They then become an easy target.\n\nThat was the risk Pavel knew he faced as he rushed to his Browning machine gun. But as long as he kept firing, his wounded brothers-in-arms had a chance to be rescued.\n\nTsygan was bleeding in the trench where Pavel had left him. Shrapnel had smashed his pelvis. Another piece had gone through his thigh, and a third had hit his abdomen, \"turning the internal organs upside down\", he said. He was barely conscious.\n\n\"I didn't see much, it was all white,\" he said. \"I lay on the snowy ground for two hours and I didn't feel cold or anything.\"\n\nNext to him was another wounded soldier. The rescue team on an armoured personnel carrier hastily picked them up as shelling resumed. They didn't even have time to close the hatch, Tsygan says.\n\nBy that time, Pavel's machine gun had fallen silent. He died from a head wound: a piece of shrapnel had pierced his helmet.\n\nCommanders of the 206th battalion decided to send a group to retrieve the bodies of Pavel and the other soldiers.\n\nThe next day in the evening, three groups of two soldiers each set off to bring the bodies back.\n\n\"The plan looked good on paper, but things quickly went wrong,\" junior sergeant Vasyl Palamarchuk, who was in the lead group, remembers. They got lost and nearly ran into Russian positions in the dark. When they got close to the dugout, Russians spotted them and opened fire from a tank.\n\nPavel Kuzin died holding off Russian attackers so his wounded fellow soldiers could be evacuated\n\nRussian tanks and artillery had continuously shelled that post in those days, but the Ukrainian big guns had largely stayed quiet. The reason was a massive shortage of shells.\n\n\"Once we counted that the Russians had fired up to 60 shells a day, whereas we could allow only two,\" Palamarchuk explains. \"They destroyed trees and everything else and you had no place to hide.\"\n\nUkraine is struggling to find ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery. Getting shells for weapons donated by Ukraine's western partners has its own limits. As the secretary general of the Nato military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently: \"The current rate of Ukraine's ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production.\"\n\nPalamarchuk's group eventually picked up Pavel's body just a few hours before Russian troops seized the area. Heavy snow turned into a freezing rain. After numerous breaks on the way back, crawling through craters left by shells, they finally arrived.

That is smaller than the percentage of those who use and get their news from Facebook, Prof Edgerly noted.\n\nThe academic added that news outlets have grappled for some time with how to use social media, especially when news articles can appear side-by-side with misinformation and unmoderated content.\n\nWorking with social media platforms collaboratively over the years has been beneficial, but Prof Edgerly said these partnerships at Twitter \"have been crumbling\" over the last few months.\n\nAs for whether other news organisations may follow NPR in pausing their activity on Twitter, Prof Edgerly believes NPR's not-for-profit status may have made it easier for it to quit the platform.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see if anyone follows,\" Prof Edgerly said. \"It is a different calculus for other organisations.\"\n\nIn a staff meeting on Wednesday morning, NPR's CEO John Lansing said the company was looking to \"de-emphasise Twitter\", according to a tweet by NPR presenter Steve Inskeep.\n\n\"NPR says Twitter isn't used by most Americans; drives little traffic to NPR; and 'no longer has the public service relevance that it once had,'\" Mr Inskeep tweeted, citing the CEO's comments.", "The hearse was left on the pitch following the incident\n\nA football match has been called off in chaos after a funeral hearse and a car were driven onto the pitch.\n\nThe friendly between Dunston and Gateshead was abandoned at half-time amid extraordinary scenes which stunned watching supporters.\n\nFootage posted on social media showed the vehicles being driven in circles in the centre of the pitch.\n\nTwo men - who witnesses said were masked - then climbed out of the hearse and into the car and left the ground.\n\nGateshead FC fan Archie told the BBC the intruders \"apparently barged through the gate from the car park\" then broke through the railings along the edge of the pitch.\n\nHe said posters were thrown out of the car's window in an apparent protest before \"two people in ski masks\" jumped out of the hearse and into the silver car and drove off.\n\nThe posters included a number of personal allegations about two individuals.\n\nMatty Hewitt, a football writer at the Newcastle Chronicle, said Northern Premier League club Dunston's UTS Stadium was evacuated as a police helicopter circled overhead following the incident.\n\n\"Two cars driven onto the pitch with masked men getting out and leaving a hearse on the pitch,\" he tweeted, describing it as a \"terrifying experience with plenty of children about\".\n\nThe match was abandoned by the referee.\n\nDunston UTS FC said it was a \"family-orientated community club\" and apologised for \"any distress\" felt by its supporters and visitors, \"particularly the younger fans\".\n\n\"Thankfully nobody was physically hurt or injured,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"We will be working as hard as ever to repair the damage caused to our pitch and perimeter fencing and look forward to the forthcoming season.\"\n\nNorthumbria Police said they had launched an investigation.\n\n\"Disorder will not be tolerated in the community and anyone found to be involved will be dealt with robustly,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"While inquiries are at an early stage, it is believed that those involved are known to each other and there was no wider risk to the public.\n\n\"We are also aware that images and videos of the disturbance are being circulated on social media.\n\n\"Members of the public are urged not to speculate and are encouraged to share any footage with police to assist the investigation.\n\n\"Police remain in the area to carry out inquiries and offer reassurance to the public and those with concerns are encouraged to speak with an officer on duty.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Now, a wider audit of 150,000 women who have had subtotal hysterectomies has been launched.\n\nIn a letter to health boards and GP practices in February, the Scottish government said it expected about 13,000 patients to require further medical investigation.\n\nPatients identified as at risk will be invited for appointments over the next 12 months.\n\nSamantha Dixon, the chief Executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said women should not be alarmed.\n\n\"This audit is part of a wider piece of work ensuring that everyone eligible for cervical screening is being regularly invited,\" she said.\n\n\" It might sound worrying, but do remember cervical cancer is a rare cancer and risk of developing it remains low.\"\n\nThe Scottish government apologised for \"any anxiety caused by the audit\".\n\nA spokesperson added: \"The risk to those who have been excluded is low and it is very much a precautionary step as the overwhelming majority of exclusions will be correct.\n\n\"In partnership with NHS Scotland, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust has made its national helpline available to anyone with concerns.\n\n\"You can get more information, advice and support by contacting the free helpline on 0808 802 8000.\"", "A few months ago the government was suggesting that any public sector pay settlements above 5% would add to inflationary pressures. That was despite the fact that this still equated to a significant real terms pay cut, and public sector settlements do not directly add to pricing pressures.\n\nOn Thursday the government accepted settlements of up to 7% across a range of jobs, as recommended by the Pay Review Bodies.\n\nRichard Hughes, who heads the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told me that because the pay deals were being funded by savings made elsewhere, rather than through additional spending, they wouldn't be adding to the overall level of spending or the overall level of borrowing.\n\nSo in principle the pay awards would be \"affordable, subject to those savings actually being realised\", he said.\n\nOn whether 5% to 7% pay rises could entrench inflation, as the government had previously claimed, Mr Hughes told me: \"The pressure that it puts on inflation would be offset, were the government to find savings elsewhere in departmental budgets, because that means that departments are spending less on other things, and that's not pushing up demand on goods and services elsewhere\".\n\nOne of the arguments offered up by ministers over the past year has been that high public sector pay settlements could act as a ratchet for private sector wages, and thus contribute to inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation is proving stickier here than elsewhere. It is expected to remain at around 8% when new figures are released on Wednesday. In France it is now below 5%. In the US it has fallen to 3%.\n\nSo the numbers will remain high into next year and in the crucial months for calculating the state pension triple lock, the uprating of tax credits and benefits, and next year's public sector pay round.\n\nHigh inflation will also mean tax receipts are higher, especially as the government has frozen income tax thresholds. But it's having an ugly effect on government borrowing costs.\n\nThis week's tricky pay decisions came in the wake of some awful long term tax and spending projections from the OBR.\n\nThe basic message of the OBR's fiscal risk report was that we are now in a new world of having both a large national debt and high and rising interest rates. In particular the UK's public finances are set to suffer even more than other countries', because a quarter of our debt is linked to inflation - bad news in current circumstances - and because our debt is also very short term.\n\nWhen factoring in plausible future energy shocks, the OBR can see a path to national debt reaching an astonishing 300% or even 400% of national income in 2070. While some might rise an eyebrow about forecasts over this timeframe, the point is that the OBR fears a sluggishly growing UK economy, with a high debt and high interest rates, risks falling into a debt spiral.\n\nIt points to fears that the UK is spending everything on fighting the consequences of inflation rather than investing in the future.\n\nAs the former NHS Pay Review Body chair Jerry Cope told me for my Radio 4 Analysis documentary on strikes this week, a rejection of their recommendations would have prompted \"fury\" and elongated the period of strikes.\n\nThis deal keeps those Pay Review Bodies functioning as a way of defusing these pay tensions. But with inflation remaining high, and workers buoyed by using industrial action to secure higher wages, those tensions are not going to disappear.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Gough Island is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha - itself a remote British territory in the south Atlantic\n\nA British wildlife group is looking for someone to work on one of the remotest islands in the world for 13 months.\n\nGough Island, a British territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean, has no permanent population.\n\nIt is around 1,500 miles (2,400km) from the African mainland - and, with no airport, reaching Gough involves a seven-day boat ride from South Africa.\n\nIt is a journey already completed by Rebekah Goodwill and Lucy Dorman, who currently work on Gough.\n\nThey are among the seven full-time employees - and eight million birds - who call Gough home.\n\nThe pair work for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Before moving to Gough, Lucy worked in Antarctica while Rebekah worked for the RSPB in Scotland.\n\nRebekah's year on the island will end in September, so the RSPB is looking for a new field officer, with a salary of between \u00a325,000 and \u00a327,000.\n\nThe job involves \"frequent long days\" tracking seabird species, and requires candidates to adapt well to living in a \"challenging and remote sub-Antarctic environment\".\n\nCandidates should also have \"a science degree or equivalent experience in a relevant subject\", as well as \"wild bird/animal handling and monitoring experience in the field\".\n\nAnd Rebekah and Lucy warn potential employees they will have to brave tough weather - and put up with no fresh food for a year.\n\n\"I think Bekah and I, being British, thought we were used to rain,\" Lucy says. \"But there's a lot of rain.\"\n\nShe adds: \"We are on the edge of the roaring forties, we are just a small rock in the middle of the south Atlantic, so we do have some pretty extreme weather.\"\n\nThe roaring forties describes the area between the latitudes 40 and 50 south of the equator - notorious for strong winds.\n\nSo what do you eat when you're more than a thousand miles from the nearest country?

Just some crunch, but apart from that - I don't feel like I'm really missing much.\"\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables pose too much of a biosecurity risk of germinating and spreading across the island.

Its approval by regulators is expected soon and production could begin as early as 2026.\n\nShould it go ahead? If it does, what will be the environmental impact? If it doesn't, what's the alternative?\n\nShetland is a perfect place to explore these questions. Leaving aside the environmental impact of the 500 million barrels of oil it could produce, just powering Rosebank and its sister fields would use the equivalent of half of the energy being produced by a giant and controversial new windfarm currently being built on Shetland.\n\nThe archipelago of 100 islands straddling the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean became part of Scotland in 1472 but never lost its Norse links.\n\nThis week, islanders celebrated their heritage in the old harbour of Scalloway in an event to mark the 2023 Tall Ships race.\n\nLocals dressed in tunics, capes and feather-tipped helmets brandished axes and hurled burning torches into a replica of a Viking longboat.\n\nBut any visitor who thought that the islands were stuck in the past would have been badly mistaken.\n\nThis may have been a land of farmers and fishers until the 1970s but the discovery of North Sea oil changed everything.\n\nThe construction of a terminal at Sullom Voe, an inlet in the north of the largest island, brought not just jobs but a fee for every barrel of oil it handled.\n\nThat meant the local council could set up an investment fund, which continues to pay for high-quality public services such as roads, care homes and sports facilities.\n\nIn the main town of Lerwick - 400 miles from Oslo; 600 miles from London - a smart leisure centre stands alongside a stylish school.\n\nEnvironmentalists on the islands acknowledge that Shetland has done well from hydrocarbons but say it is time to cut the cord.\n\nAlex Armitage, a councillor from the Scottish Green Party, who is also the islands' consultant paediatrician, describes oil and gas as a \"sunset industry\".\n\nHe says the wildfires which have ravaged the Greek island of Rhodes in recent days underline the urgency of accelerating the move to renewable energy by blocking new drilling in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe UK oil and gas regulator is currently considering whether or not to approve drilling in the Rosebank oil field, 80 miles west of Shetland, one of the biggest untapped reserves in British waters, containing between 300 million and 500 million barrels of oil.\n\nEarlier this week, UK Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK should \"max out\" its remaining reserves.\n\nThere are plenty of Shetlanders who agree with that stance.\n\nFrom the 1970s Arlene Robertson worked as a cook, a cleaner and a nurse at Sullom Voe. \"I was part of that boom,\" she says.\n\nThese days Ms Robertson campaigns for the islands to have greater control of their own affairs as a member of a group called the Shetland Autonomy Action Team.\n\nShe is in favour of Rosebank.\n\n\"We all want a better climate. We all want a better world to live in but I think, realistically, we have to follow what's feasible, and shutting down oil and trying to import it from places like Russia doesn't make much sense to me,\" she says.\n\nDr Armitage disagrees. \"The idea that [Rosebank] will support our UK national energy security is quite frankly preposterous,\" he says, pointing out that while some gas would be piped to Shetland, the oil would be pumped onto tankers at sea and exported \"to Rotterdam or wherever else in the world it would be able to be sold to the highest bidder\".\n\nThis week, the Norwegian oil company Equinor, which is the principal developer of Rosebank, underlined its \"clear expectation\" that the project would move forward.\n\nThe state-controlled firm's chief financial officer, Torgrim Reitan, said he was \"awaiting final conclusion on a couple of topics, and final approval from the regulators\" and expected \"some clarifications not too far into the future\".\n\nGreta Thunberg joined fellow climate campaigners in London on Friday to demand that the UK government rejects the huge Rosebank oil field\n\nWhile those discussions continue, the energy mix on Shetland is already changing, with the construction by SSE Renewables of a giant wind farm called Viking.\n\nMore than 70 of the project's 103 turbines, which measure 155m (509ft) from ground to blade-tip, have been erected so far.\n\nThe blades should start spinning next summer, supplying electricity to the UK National Grid via a subsea cable linking the islands and the Scottish mainland for the first time.\n\nSSE says the wind farm could provide enough electricity to power nearly 500,000 homes for the next 25 years.\n\nHeather Donald, the company's director of onshore development and construction, says Shetland \"will effectively decarbonise overnight with the flick of a switch,\" and provide \"a case study\" in energy transition for the rest of the UK.\n\nNot all Shetlanders are convinced.\n\nThere are claims about disruption of the peat moorland where the windfarm is being built; talk of the \"industrialisation\" of a once-rugged landscape; and worries about how much the community will benefit economically.\n\nAlthough Arlene Robertson and Alex Armitage have very different views on the pace of switching to renewable energy, they are united in a belief that the oil and gas boom is not being repeated.\n\nMr Armitage says Shetlanders are \"shivering in their homes\" because of high energy bills and Viking will not bring their costs down or bring significant extra funds to the community.\n\nMs Robertson agrees, saying: \"I'm absolutely horrified at the poor deal that we've got. It's peanuts.\"\n\nHeather Donald is SSE's director of onshore development and construction\n\nMs Donald of SSE denies Viking will have a negative effect on the peat.\n\nShe says the project is employing 400 people including 100 locals; and she insists it will help reduce bills and provide \"the biggest community benefit fund of any renewable project in the UK\".\n\n\"When the site goes into operation next year, it will be \u00a32.2m every year for the duration of the wind farm,\" she adds.\n\nBut how will the electricity Viking produces be used?\n\nThe Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) is understood to be keen on the Rosebank oil field being powered by electricity supplied from shore rather than the traditional North Sea method of using gas or diesel generators.\n\nEquinor, BP and Ithaca are exploring electrification for Rosebank; the existing Clair Ridge development; and, potentially, the Cambo field, which is currently in limbo.\n\nThe BBC has been told that \"onshore connection to Shetland\" using \"the oversupply of renewable energy\" from the islands is an option under consideration.\n\nEquinor has said that electrification of all three fields would require around 200 megawatts of power.\n\nBut environmental lawyer, Tessa Khan, of the pressure group Uplift, says using renewables to perpetuate the burning of fossil fuels \"would be laughable if it wasn't so serious\".\n\nUplift's analysts reckon the power required for the three fields could be closer to 250mw, equivalent to more than half of the potential output from the 443mw Viking wind farm.\n\n\"Rosebank will produce oil for export and will not boost the UK's energy security,\" insists Ms Khan.\n\n\"If it also ends up taking vast amounts of cheap, clean energy that could be used to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, it will end up actively reducing the UK's energy security,\" she adds.\n\n\"We have no control over where the power goes,\" stresses Heather Donald of SSE Renewables.\n\nOnce the electricity is in the National Grid, she points out, it could be exported anywhere in the UK.\n\nNonetheless, the idea that a wind farm could provide electricity to half a million homes or end up powering several oil fields underlines the complexity of the UK's energy transition.", "Busy night for cab drivers after shutdown of public transport\n\nTaxi drivers here in Paris and across France are having a busier night than usual, following the nationwide suspension of bus and tram services.

According to a biography of Ms Sturgeon by David Torrance they first met in 1988 at an SNP youth weekend and became a couple in 2003.\n\nThey never had children but Ms Sturgeon later revealed the painful experience of suffering a miscarriage when she was 40, shortly before the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election campaign.\n\n\"Sometimes... having a baby just doesn't happen - no matter how much we might want it to,\" she said.\n\nPeter Murrell and Nicola Sturgeon were married in 2010 in Glasgow\n\nThe powerful couple would be seen together at party conferences, outside polling stations and at official events such as the Queen's Jubilee concert. But while relaxed in each other's company, they were not gushy hand-holders who lingered before a gathered media.\n\nOn occasions when asked about her husband - notably during her appearance on ITV's Loose Women - Ms Sturgeon was quick to credit Mr Murrell for his cooking skills.\n\nShe has also given insight into how he has supported her political leadership. Ms Sturgeon told the Sunday Times: \"One of the things I value is that he's happy with me having the public role... He's not one of those guys who would feel threatened by it. He doesn't have that sort of ego, he's very self-assured.\"\n\nMr Murrell has similarly spoken of his respect for his wife's intellect, saying: \"She's very, very sharp and on top of whatever the issue of the day is. That spark is always there. We are constantly having conversations that I'm amazed by.\"\n\nIt clearly suited the FM's husband to be in the background but he, and his role as chief executive, came under scrutiny during the inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of complaints against former first minister Alex Salmond.\n\nAt the Holyrood Inquiry in 2020, Mr Murrell denied plotting against Mr Salmond. But opposition MSPs believed that Mr Murrell contradicted himself, and Ms Sturgeon, over some of the details he gave in evidence.\n\nHe was pressed repeatedly about whether the meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond were SNP business, as the first minister had insisted, or government business - which would need to be officially recorded.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell the SNP was an election winning machine\n\nMr Murrell was back in the media spotlight in December last year when it was confirmed he had given a loan of \u00a3107,620 to the SNP to help it out with a \"cash flow\" issues.\n\nThe SNP had repaid about half of the money by October of that year and the party's official line was that the loan was a \"personal contribution made by the chief executive to assist with cash flow after the Holyrood election\".\n\nThese questions were difficult ones for Ms Sturgeon and she had to awkwardly bat away media probes about what she knew of her husband's financial situation - \"that is for him,\" she said at an FM's update at the beginning of the year.\n\nDespite this discomfort she continued to lead the country and he continued to be in charge of the party machine.\n\nBut then Ms Sturgeon announced her decision to resign. Some commentators said it would be inevitable that Mr Murrell would also have to go but his departure has happened before his wife's.\n\nPressure mounted on him when two of the three candidates vying to be new party leader and first minister publicly questioned the contest they were taking part in.\n\nFrom the outset, contender Ash Regan said Mr Murrell's position as SNP chief executive was a \"clear conflict of interest\".\n\nAnd this theme would not go away with another candidate, Kate Forbes, questioning the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nWhat led the chief executive to go was linked to a row about party membership and who would be voting in this election.\n\nOne point of pride for Mr Murrell had been his campaign to increase followers after the failed Scottish independence referendum of 2014 and the coronation of his wife as leader and first minister.\n\nThe SNP went from a membership of less than 25,000 in 2013 to more than 125,000 by December 2019.\n\nBut that figure has fallen back to 72,000 and the party only reluctantly confirmed this when media and opposition pressure, plus questions from all three candidates, became too much.\n\nThe power couple who helped shaped Scottish politics in the first two decades of this century are no more - Mr Murrell is now gone and his wife will soon follow.", "WARNING: This article discusses a major plot spoiler from the third episode of Succession's fourth season.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSuccession star Brian Cox has said he thought his character Logan Roy was killed off \"too early\" in the latest series of the acclaimed HBO drama.\n\nThe Dundee-born actor praised writer Jesse Armstrong, however, for executing the plot line \"brilliantly\".\n\nThe fourth and final series of the Emmy-winning show saw Cox's media mogul killed off in the third episode.\n\nCox told the BBC's Amol Rajan: \"He [Armstrong] decided to make Logan die, I think ultimately too early.\"\n\n\"I mean, he'd made him die in the third episode,\" Cox continued. \"And it was a great scene. That's why I didn't watch it, because I have no interest in watching. My own death will come soon enough.\n\n\"But I just thought, 'wow', you know, he did it brilliantly. It was a brilliant scene, the whole act.\"\n\nAsked if he considered suggesting to Armstrong that Logan was being killed off too soon, Cox said: \"No, I didn't. There's no point going down that road, especially with somebody like Jesse, because he's already made a plan.\"\n\nLogan Roy's death in the early part of the current season was unexpected, throwing the future of his media and entertainment company Waystar Royco into doubt and creating a new dynamic between his power-hungry children.\n\nCox recalled how the \"internet went crazy\" when his character died after suffering a heart attack on a private jet.\n\nThere had been no warning to Succession's legions of loyal viewers that Roy's death was imminent. It was handled without fanfare, with his children caught off guard and denied a chance to say any kind of emotional goodbye to their father in person.\n\n\"It was an odd feeling,\" Cox said of his character's death. \"I looked on it, wrongly, as a form of rejection. I was fine with it ultimately, but I did feel a little bit rejected. I felt a little bit, 'oh, all the work I've done. And finally I'm going to end up as a New Yorker on a carpet of a plane'.\"\n\nThree of Logan Roy's children - played by Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin - jostle for position in their father's company\n\nPerhaps the most critically-acclaimed TV drama of the past decade, Succession follows Logan Roy and his four children - three of whom are competing to take over from him as the CEO of his hugely successful company.\n\nThose children - played by Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin - are seen constantly jostling for position and attempting to curry favour with their father.\n\nRoy's eldest child (played by Alan Ruck) has ambitions of his own, and this season mounted a campaign to become US president.\n\nThe show's sharp and snappy dialogue - a trademark of Armstrong's - often sees the characters deliver some brutal put-downs to one another.\n\nMany have drawn parallels between the Roy family with the real-life Murdoch family, but Armstrong has maintained the series is fictional and not intended to be a representation of them.\n\nCox's co-star, J Smith-Cameron, who plays Gerri, told the BBC's Americast she felt Succession could have carried on following Logan Roy's death.\n\n\"Those of us who didn't play Roys, we still felt like we're very full storylines... you could have several more seasons about the world of Succession,\" she said. \"But I think from Jesse's point of view, he was trying to literally address the topic of succession in that family.\"\n\nThree of Roy's children battle for his company, while a fourth (played by Alan Ruck, second left) wants to be US president\n\nCox said viewers had told him they were less keen to continue with the show after his character's death.\n\n\"They said, 'no, I'm not going to watch anymore. You've gone, I'm not watching',\" Cox said. \"Which I think is unfortunate and unnecessary because the show is about the succession. So you need to see what's happening in in the wake of his demise. But, you know, I'm not the writer.\"\n\nCox joked that he was surprised to have been entrusted with key information about the plot while they were filming, because, he said: \"I've never been able to keep a secret in my life.\"\n\n\"In fact, I had a very close friend of mine once who wanted to confide in me, and I said, 'don't'. I said, Never confide in me because I will tell everybody.\n\n\"And it was bold of Jesse. And that's where Jesse's great. I mean, he's a genius. There's no question he's a writing genius.\"\n\nSmith-Cameron added: \"We were all sworn to secrecy, and we were all like, 'will there even be a show without Brian Cox?' Because he sort of drives the whole thing and polarises all the characters so much.

Watch: Biden chuckles at thought of Trump running again", "The Nuffield Trust said long waits for autism assessments were especially damaging for children\n\nThe extraordinary rise in demand for autism assessments and ADHD treatments in England has overtaken the NHS's capacity to meet it, a think tank says.\n\nSince 2019, there has been a five-fold rise in people waiting to see an autism specialist and a 51% increase in prescriptions for ADHD medication, according to the Nuffield Trust.\n\nGrowing backlogs and longer waiting times are negatively impacting people's daily lives, it warned.\n\nIt said a \"radical rethink\" was needed.\n\nNuffield Trust chief executive Thea Stein said \"pumping more money\" into the current system would not help, and it was \"frankly impossible to imagine how the system can grow fast enough to fulfil this demand\".\n\n\"We're at a really critical point as a society, where we're actually understanding neurodiversity and the fact that it's a much greater spectrum for the whole of society than we've ever had before,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"It's a really complicated issue for us to all collectively understand as a society.\"\n\nThe Nuffield Trust said 24% of patients referred for ADHD in England were having to wait one to two years for an assessment.\n\nOn top of this, thousands of people with ADHD have been unable to get prescribed medication amid a major supply shortage. This was announced in September due to \"manufacturing issues and an increased global demand\".\n\nMeanwhile,172,000 adults and children are on a waiting list for an autism assessment - the highest recorded figure - according to NHS data analysed by the think tank.\n\nBetween October and December 2023, the median time spent on a waiting list after an autism referral rose to over nine months, compared with four months in the same period in 2019.\n\nAnd in Derbyshire, the waiting time was two and half years, according to the report.\n\nEllie Middleton, a creator, writer and consultant with autism and ADHD, said receiving her late diagnoses has \"honestly been life-saving for me\".\n\nShe was diagnosed with ADHD privately. The waiting list for an initial NHS appointment was \"incredibly long\" in her local area, she said, and she was \"really struggling with not knowing what was going on\". She received an autism diagnosis through the NHS about six months later.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"Before I knew what was going on I always felt like any challenges that I faced and any things that were more difficult for me were a personal problem.\n\n\"Getting that answer to what is actually going on for you is just so validating.\"\n\nThe way NHS Digital collects data has changed since 2019 - but Ms Stein is confident it remains robust.\n\nThe rise in demand was probably due to greater awareness of the conditions and changing social attitudes, the Nuffield Trust said.\n\nADHD was the second most viewed health condition on the NHS website in 2023, after Covid-19, according to NHS England.\n\nMs Stein warned long waits would have a \"serious effect\" on children in particular, as many schools provided extra support only after a diagnosis.\n\n\"We've certainly got to have a different approach within educational services that says you don't need that letter in your hand,\" she said.\n\nPeople should not have to have a diagnosis just \"to get a label out of it\".\n\nAnd wider societal change was needed \"to allow ourselves to include more people who present with more neurodiversity\".\n\n\"We are going to need to think in a much more creative way than simply have a conversation that says we need more NHS resources, as that isn't the solution,\" Ms Stein added.\n\nSir Simon Wessely, Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London, said the change in demand for ADHD diagnosis and treatment was \"dramatic\" but there was no evidence to suggest the disorder was getting more common.\n\nHe told the Today programme that GPs are seeing some patients who are looking for \"validation\" and \"recognition\" and \"not always wanting treatment\".\n\n\"They don't necessarily think they are ill, they think they are different\".\n\nThere \"probably isn't a medical answer to that\", he said, adding it was a wider issue for society.\n\nThe charity Child Autism said the spike since 2019 may be party due to the suspension of some services during the pandemic, causing a backlog.\n\nIts chief executive, Suzy Yardley, agreed a new \"coherent UK-wide plan\" was needed.\n\n\"Autistic children have huge amounts to contribute, and we need an overhaul of the system to ensure this can happen\", she said.\n\nDr James Cusack, chief executive of the charity Autistica, said: \"It has been evident for some time that services need to adapt to the knowledge that there are more neurodivergent people than we used to think.\"\n\nAnd there was a \"need to focus on each person's strengths and needs so that they get the support they need earlier\".\n\nA Department of Health official said: \"We know it's vital to have a timely diagnosis of autism or ADHD and we are taking action to reduce assessment delays.\n\n\"NHS England has published a national framework to help speed up autism assessments and is establishing a new ADHD taskforce alongside the government, to improve care for people living with the condition.\n\n\"In addition, our \u00a313m partnership with NHS England will help improve specialist support for neurodiverse children in primary schools.\"\n\nAre you waiting for an autism or ADHD assessment?

Something like this can't happen in the world we live in.\"\n\nReal Madrid issued a statement on Monday stating its \"strongest revulsion\" at the racist abuse suffered by Vinicius.\n\nIt added: \"Real Madrid considers that such attacks also constitute a hate crime, for which reason it has filed the corresponding complaint with the State Attorney General's Office, specifically with the Prosecutor's Office against hate crimes and discrimination, so that the facts can be investigated and clear responsibilities.\"\n\n'This is an isolated episode' - Valencia\n\nValencia said they would investigate and \"take the most severe measures\".\n\n\"Valencia CF wishes to publicly condemn any type of insult, attack or disqualification in football,\" a club statement read.\n\n\"Although this is an isolated episode, insults to any player from the rival team have no place in football and do not fit in with the values and identity of Valencia CF.\"\n\nLa Liga said it had been proactive after previous racist abuse against Vinicius, and had filed nine reports in the past two seasons to legal authorities in Spain.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino said he had \"full solidarity\" with Vinicius and highlighted the world governing body's protocols for events like those at Valencia.\n\n\"Firstly, you stop the match, you announce it. Secondly, the players leave the pitch and the speaker announces that if the attacks continue, the match will be suspended,\" he said.\n\n\"The match restarts, and then, thirdly, if the attacks continue, the match will stop and the three points will go to the opponent. These are the rules that should be implemented in all countries and in all leagues.\n\n\"Clearly, this is easier said than done, but we need to do it and we need to support it through education.\"\n\n'The authorities don't help him' - Ferdinand\n\nFormer England and Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand wrote on Instagram: \"Bro you need protecting.... who is protecting Vinicius Junior in Spain??\n\n\"How many times do we need to see this young man subjected to this? I see pain, I see disgust, I see him needing help... and the authorities don't help him.\n\n\"People need to stand together and demand more from the authorities that run our game.\n\n\"No-one deserves this, yet you are allowing it.

It's the 10th time that this has happened to Vinicius.\n\n\"Maybe the solution is to suspend the match. Maybe the solution is that Vinicius decides not to be on the field any more. Maybe that will be the solution to make people aware that they cannot behave like this in a football stadium.\"\n\nAnti-racism charity Kick It Out's head of player engagement Troy Townsend said \"the welfare of Vinicius is not being protected and that needs to change\".\n\n\"Vinicius Jr has now been subjected to racism numerous times this season while simply playing football for Real Madrid, and it has clearly taken its toll. How could it not? And yet the response from the Spanish football authorities has been to criticise him,\" he added.\n\n\"Perpetrators of this shocking and continued racism need to be punished and banned by clubs. Clubs need to be held accountable and be sanctioned by La Liga.\n\n\"Spanish authorities need to take further action against this problem. So far, it is not working.\"\n\nThe racist abuse that Vinicius has had to deal with this season\n\u2022 September 2022 - Some Atletico Madrid fans sang racist songs toward Vinicius outside their Wanda Metropolitano stadium before Real Madrid played them in September 2022.\n\u2022 September 2022 - some pundits in Spain criticise Vinicius' goal celebration, in which he dances by corner flag. by saying \"the happiness of a black Brazilian in Europe\" is behind the criticism.\n\u2022 December 2022 - Vinicius appeared to be subjected to racist abuse at Valladolid while he walked past fans after being substituted.

First Minister Humza Yousaf said the resignation of SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was the \u2018right thing to do\u2019.\n\nFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is married to former SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested two weeks ago at the couple's home in Glasgow before also being released without charge pending further inquiries.\n\nOfficers spent two days searching the house, and also searched the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh.\n\nThere have been newspaper reports that some people within the party are concerned that Ms Sturgeon could be the next person to be arrested in the inquiry.\n\nDeputy First Minister Shona Robison, a close friend of Ms Sturgeon, said earlier on Wednesday that it would not be helpful to comment on the speculation and that she did not know if Ms Sturgeon had spoken to detectives.\n\nAsked if she had been in contact with Ms Sturgeon, Ms Robison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Right at the beginning of the process I sent her a very short message asking after her welfare really and I got a very short reply.\n\n\"We have had no discussion whatsoever about the police investigation. It would not be appropriate for me to do so.\"\n\nMr Yousaf has dismissed calls for Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell and Mr Beattie to be suspended from the party while the police investigation is ongoing, saying he believes in people being innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThe party raised \u00a3666,953 through referendum-related appeals between 2017 and 2020 with a pledge to spend these funds on the independence campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nOfficers involved in the investigation spent two days searching the couple's Glasgow home and the party's headquarters in Edinburgh earlier this month.\n\nThere was an inevitability about this announcement. It was hard to imagine Colin Beattie continuing as SNP treasurer while under police investigation.\n\nHe announced the decision to quit after a conversation with Humza Yousaf who says it was the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, opposition parties say Mr Yousaf should have removed Colin Beattie as treasurer and gone further in suspending him from the SNP.\n\nIt means that Humza Yousaf is in temporary charge of the SNP's finances but he told me he's got enough on his plate and wants someone else appointed to the role as soon as possible.\n\nThe party faces major challenges as the police investigation into its finances continues, including trying to find new auditors to replace those that quit seven months ago.\n\nA luxury motorhome was seized by officers from outside a property in Dunfermline on the same morning Mr Murrell was arrested.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday reported that the vehicle had been parked outside the home of Mr Murrell's 92-year-old mother since January 2021.

It had been due to run from 2015 to 2030.\n\nThe decision to end Serco's contract came after the company tried to renegotiate the deal through a \"rebase clause\", to put the loss-making service on \"a more sustainable financial footing\".\n\nMs Gilruth said the decision not to rebase was \"in no way a reflection on the quality of the product that has been developed, nor on the commitment of the staff who deliver this service every day\".\n\nShe added: \"Rather, the decision that I had to take on rebasing was a question of the terms of the rebase offer and that, in the government's view, these terms did not represent the best value for money.\"\n\nJohn Whitehurst, managing director of Serco's transport business, said the company was disappointed that the Scottish government \"did not ensure value for money by examining the possibility of a direct contract award to Serco\".\n\nHe argued that the award would have \"allowed Scotland to benefit from the expertise of our Serco Transport senior management team who understand this complex and unique hospitality-focussed train operation like no-one else, while also enabling Scottish ministers to be in complete control of the contract\".\n\nHe added: \"Most importantly, this would have allowed the Scottish government to compare the price of such an award with that of their arm's length operator of last resort company.\"\n\nMr Whitehurst also said that since Serco took over the management of the Caledonian Sleeper in 2015, it had brought about \"massive improvements to every aspect of the service for our employees, our passengers and for Scotland, despite having made significant losses on the contract\".\n\nThe service, which has been operating in various forms since 1873, runs overnight trains between Scotland and London.\n\nThere is a Lowlander route between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a Highlander route to Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William.\n\nScottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said the service had seen its highest revenue since the start of the franchise over the past year, with passenger numbers back to pre-Covid levels and guest and employee satisfaction all going up.\n\nHe added: \"The minister agreed that the sleeper has surpassed any other train company in the UK in its recovery from the pandemic and was thriving and a world class service.\n\n\"Given all that, there can be no conclusion other than that this is an ideological decision. Jenny Gilruth said nothing about how this world class service can be improved under the Scottish government.\"\n\nMr Simpson also said Ms Gilruth had given no idea of how much the nationalisation would cost, or how Scottish taxpayers would receive value for money from the move.\n\nA new fleet of trains was introduced in 2019\n\nThe RMT said it would give the Scottish government \"an opportunity to ensure this sustainable, low carbon route between Scotland and London can be run for passengers' interests, not private profit\".\n\nTrain drivers' union Aslef also backed the move but said it was disappointed that the minister had not taken the opportunity to bring the sleeper service into ScotRail.\n\nIn 2019, Serco put an improvement plan in place after the service was hit by strike action, technical faults and the late delivery of new trains.\n\nThat year, it also unveiled a new fleet of trains, which the company said would \"transform\" the service.\n\nMr Whitehurst said then that the business had inherited an \"unreliable and outdated\" fleet of carriages which dated back to the 1970s.\n\nThe sleeper service will be the second rail operation to be taken into state hands in Scotland in recent times.\n\nLast April, ScotRail officially returned to public ownership for the first time in 25 years, after previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service.\n\nOther transport-related firms which have been brought into public ownership in recent years include shipbuilder Ferguson Marine in 2019 and Prestwick Airport in 2013 - both of which have proved to be controversial.", "An investigation into sexual misconduct at one of Britain's biggest business lobby groups has been widened after new allegations have emerged.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry is at the centre of claims published by the Guardian, detailing alleged misconduct by individuals.\n\n\"The CBI has treated and continues to treat all matters of workplace conduct with the utmost seriousness,\" it said.\n\n\"Which is why last month, we commissioned a thorough investigation by an independent law firm into all recent allegations that have been put to us.\"\n\nThe most serious allegation relates to a woman who claims she was raped by a senior colleague at a CBI summer boat party in 2019.\n\nThe woman told the Guardian she felt let down by a CBI manager who, she claims, advised her to seek out counselling rather than pursue the matter further.\n\nRegarding this allegation, a CBI spokesperson said: \"We have found no evidence or record of this matter.

His wish for that to show in action was not granted.\n\nThe Scots were slack and slapdash and, while they dominated possession, it was the Serbs who probed the most.\n\nPerhaps that was due to the presence of Damnjanovic. The 29-year-old plays at the highest level in Germany and was by far the best player at Stadium Dubocica.\n\nIn stark comparison, Scotland started with Davidson through the middle - a player who arguably plays her best club football out on the wing.\n\nIt's small margins at the elite level and a star striker really could be all the difference.\n\nHowever, it was not just a striking issue for Scotland. There was a lack of zip in midfield.\n\nBayern's Sam Kerr was the opposite to her club team-mate and was extremely quiet, while Cuthbert - who is so often turned to for a moment of stardom - could not muster up any tricks.\n\nOn paper, this was the hardest game of the group out of the way. However, Scotland are still the top seeds in this group and the longer this winless run in competitive fixtures continues, the louder the criticism will be.\n\nWhat they said\n\nScotland head coach Pedro Martinez Losa: \"I think it was a game of two different phases. We had good moments on the ball, opportunities in the final third and I think, the second half, the opponent had a good level in the final third and we had moments where we made sure we didn't lose the game and we also had moments where we could have won the game but we didn't take advantage.\n\n\"This result can be good if we can get the three points on Tuesday, or if we beat Serbia at home. I think this is about the campaign. We picked up a point away from home against the most difficult opponent. Everything else is irrelevant.\"\n\nScotland defender Sophie Howard: \"I think we are disappointed not to get more, but in the end, it was a deserved point for both teams.\n\n\"I think we could have given the game away at the end, but we showed great character to hold on, put bodies on the line and just disappointed not to get more.\"\n\nScotland take on Slovakia at Hampden on Tuesday, 9 April with a 19:35 BST kick-off, while Serbia take on Israel at 15:00 on the same day.\n\u2022 None Samantha Kerr (Scotland) wins a free kick on the right wing.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.\n\nIn its report, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said \"every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards\".", "Artificial intelligence (AI) could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs, a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs says.\n\nIt could replace a quarter of work tasks in the US and Europe but may also mean new jobs and a productivity boom.\n\nAnd it could eventually increase the total annual value of goods and services produced globally by 7%.\n\nGenerative AI, able to create content indistinguishable from human work, is \"a major advancement\", the report says.\n\nThe government is keen to promote investment in AI in the UK, which it says will \"ultimately drive productivity across the economy\", and has tried to reassure the public about its impact.\n\n\"We want to make sure that AI is complementing the way we work in the UK, not disrupting it - making our jobs better, rather than taking them away,\" Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan told the Sun.\n\nThe report notes AI's impact will vary across different sectors - 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction 4% in maintenance, it says.\n\nBBC News has previously reported some artists' concerns AI image generators could harm their employment prospects.\n\n\"The only thing I am sure of is that there is no way of knowing how many jobs will be replaced by generative AI,\" Carl Benedikt Frey, future of-work director at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, told BBC News.\n\n\"What ChatGPT does, for example, is allow more people with average writing skills to produce essays and articles.\n\n\"Journalists will therefore face more competition, which would drive down wages, unless we see a very significant increase in the demand for such work.\n\n\"Consider the introduction of GPS technology and platforms like Uber. Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10% according to our research.\n\n\"The result was lower wages, not fewer drivers.\n\n\"Over the next few years, generative AI is likely to have similar effects on a broader set of creative tasks\".\n\nAccording to research cited by the report, 60% of workers are in occupations that did not exist in 1940.\n\nBut other research suggests technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs.\n\nAnd if generative AI is like previous information-technology advances, the report concludes, it could reduce employment in the near term.\n\nThe long-term impact of AI, however, was highly uncertain, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank Torsten Bell told BBC News, \"so all firm predictions should be taken with a very large pinch of salt\".\n\n\"We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work,\" he said.\n\n\"That's not to say that AI won't disrupt the way we work - but we should focus too on the potential living-standards gains from higher-productivity work and cheaper-to-run services, as well as the risk of falling behind if other firms and economies better adapt to technological change.\"", "Zara Aleena's killer refused to appear in the dock during his sentencing hearing\n\nThe government has been urged to press ahead with plans to force criminals to attend their own sentencing hearings.\n\nThomas Cashman refused to enter the dock when he was jailed for at least 42 years on Monday for the shooting murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel in her own home.\n\nThe aunt of another murder victim called on Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to expedite plans to compel criminals to appear for sentencing.\n\nFarah Naz also wants judges to have the ability to punish those who refuse.\n\nOpposition Leader Sir Keir Starmer said because Olivia's family \"couldn't hide\" from Cashman's \"horrendous crimes... he shouldn't be allowed to\" either.\n\nMs Naz's niece Zara Aleena was sexually assaulted and murdered by Jordan McSweeney after he attacked the 35-year-old law graduate while walking home from a night out in Ilford, Essex, on 26 June.\n\nLike Cashman, he also refused to attend his sentencing in person, leading Ms Naz to say he had wrongly taken control of the courtroom.\n\nShe said: \"It's the last bit of power that needs to be taken away [from offenders].\n\n\"I think there are other ways to make the convict come to face their judgment and that would be to add time to their sentencing, or there can be other ways.\n\n\"Otherwise we don't have people deterred from committing crimes - if they're just moving from cell to cell there's no sense of punishment.\n\n\"I would like Dominic Raab to move forward with developing this law.\"\n\nOlivia Pratt-Korbel's killer also refused to appear in the dock\n\nMs Naz said she felt \"really sad\" for Olivia's family that they were not able to see the man who \"destroyed their lives\" being sentenced.\n\n\"Surely the judgment is part of the punishment,\" she asked.\n\n\"We all wanted to face him when we were reading out victim impact statements.\n\n\"We wanted to watch him watch the footage of his murdering Zara - what he did to her,\" she said.\n\n\"As a result the whole legal process felt incomplete.\n\n\"He took power over Zara and then... in the courtroom he took power. It felt like he was able to have that,\" she said.\n\n\"Surely once they have been convicted... all their rights are removed?\"\n\nCashman, 34, killed Olivia and injured her mother Cheryl Korbel as he chased a fellow drug dealer into their Dovecot home on 22 August.\n\nNeither Cashman nor his intended target Joseph Nee were known to Ms Korbel.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Of course it is cowardly.\n\n\"One of the ideas would be to allow the judge to have the power to increase the sentence if the defendant didn't come into court to face justice.\n\n\"We should look at all options - we need something that works.\"\n\nHe added: \"At the moment there is that profound sense of a gap for victims and their families and we need to do something about that.\n\n\"We have been calling for this for some time now. The government says it is interested in that.\"\n\nMarie McCourt's 22-year-old daughter Helen was murdered in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1989 by pub landlord Ian Simms.\n\nShe said she was in tears for Olivia's family as the sentence was passed without Cashman present adding that should never happen again.\n\n\"I do think it is wrong... they allow them if they won't go in court for the sentence to stay in the cells.\"\n\n\"Ian Simms did not do that thank God. He was brought up but that is how it should be when they've been found guilty then they have to be there for the people who are there to see what has happened... and they have to face them for what they have done.\"\n\nOther criminals who have refused to enter the dock include Koci Selamaj, who murdered primary school teacher Sabina Nessa in a park in south-east London in 2021, Zahid Younis, who murdered Henriett Szucs and Mihrican Mustafa in London and kept their bodies in a freezer, and Hashem Abedi, who helped his brother, Salman, murder 22 people in the Manchester Arena bomb in 2017.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Data impact assessment should inform any policy.\"\n\nA participant in the meeting was recorded as saying: \"Think we're on sound ground in saying no - not releasing images.\"\n\nPolicing Board member Mark H Durkan said he did not understand why the PSNI takes a different approach to other police services.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) assembly member said he was aware of some instances where the PSNI's position has \"upset victims of crime, further compounding their ordeal\".\n\n\"In cases where someone has been convicted of a serious crime, I fail to understand the PSNI's rationale for withholding photographs from the media,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the key principles of our legal system is that justice must be seen to be done and the refusal to release these photographs would seem to run contrary to that.\"\n\nPSNI chief constable Jon Boutcher was formerly in charge of Bedfordshire Police\n\nA survey of police forces across the UK last year by BBC News NI found that many issue mugshots of offenders handed sentences above a certain threshold, such as a jail sentence of 12 months or more.\n\nAmong them was Bedfordshire Police, which was formerly led by the current PSNI chief constable Jon Boutcher.\n\nMr Burrows said the force's current policy is \"too risk averse\".\n\nHe said police can release custody images for a \"legitimate policing purpose\", which can include \"improving confidence in the criminal justice system, deterring crime and promoting public safety\".\n\n\"Releasing an official custody photo also helps to prevent mistaken identity, because otherwise the press often rely on older photos or ones where the defendant has concealed part of their face,\" he added.\n\nFormer PSNI officer and current Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) councillor Linzi McLaren said it was a \"balancing act\" for police.\n\n\"More often than not these issues go hand in hand with a family who have been plunged into unspeakable tragedy with the death or injury of a loved one,\" she said.\n\n\"Very often they are not afforded protection from misery and grief\u2026and yet understandably they perceive that the system is weighted towards the rights of the accused.\"\n\nThe councillor said she did not believe that police were intending a blanket ban on the releasing of such images and did not want to take one email on face value.\n\n\"The police have a huge duty of responsibility towards not only the victims but, as unpalatable as it is, sometimes they also have to and must protect the rights of the accused.\"\n\nA PSNI spokeswoman said the emails were \"not an accurate reflection\" of its policy on the release of custody images.\n\n\"All cases are considered individually on their own merits in line with legal requirements,\" she added.\n\n\"The Police Service of Northern Ireland considers each request for disclosure of a custody image in accordance with legislation applicable in Northern Ireland, police service policy and ECHR [European Convention on Human Rights] and data protection principles.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFootball legend Graeme Souness plans to swim the English Channel to help people living with a rare skin condition.\n\nThe former Liverpool, Rangers and Scotland player fought back tears as he told the BBC that Epidermolysis bullosa was the \"cruellest disease out there\".\n\nHe was inspired to take on the 16-hour challenge after meeting Isla Grist from the Scottish Highlands.\n\nThe 14-year-old's condition, known as \"butterfly skin\", causes the skin to tear or blister at the slightest touch.\n\nThe 70-year-old former player and manager choked back tears as he described Isla as \"the most unique person I've ever met\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: \"She does this to me every time.

And there was an extra one-off lump sum of at least \u00a31,655 to top up the past year's salary. But on Friday, the RCN announced its members had rejected the offer by 54% to 46%.\n\nThe walkout from 20:00 BST on 30 April to 20:00 on 2 May will involve NHS nurses in emergency departments, intensive care, cancer and other wards.\n\nNurses have already walked out twice this year on 6 and 7 February and on 18 and 19 January - but on those dates there were exemptions so that nursing cover was maintained in critical areas.\n\nThe announcement comes just as the NHS is getting back to normal after a four-day walkout by junior doctors - who are demanding a 35% pay rise - which ended at 07:00 on Saturday.\n\nSir Julian, chief executive of NHS Providers, said during the strike by junior doctors gaps had been filled by consultants and other staff, but he warned if nurses went ahead with their action this might be more difficult to deal with.\n\n\"But with nursing staff, obviously that represent a significant proportion of the workforce, taking action in those areas as well that will present an unprecedented level of action, that we haven't yet seen from nursing staff and therefore the challenges with that, the organisation and all the work that go into managing and mitigating that will be enormous,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of nurses and junior doctors striking on the same day, he added: \"They are central, pivotal to the delivery of care across all sectors, hospitals, community services, mental health services.\n\n\"So obviously the prospect of both groups being out at the same time would present enormous challenges to the service and that would be really really the most difficult challenge ever faced yet if we had to deal with that scenario.\"\n\nThe RCN's director for England, Patricia Marquis, when asked by BBC Newsnight about coordinated strike action, said it was having conversations with the British Medical Association but not specifically around coordinating strikes.\n\n\"That's obviously something that would have to be considered, least because we're all in the same space. We all work in the same places\", she said.\n\n\"And therefore there may be an issue where our strikes do at some point either coordinate or overlap in someway.\"\n\nNick Hulme, chief executive of Colchester and Ipswich Hospitals said recent strike action had been a \"massive distraction from the work we should be doing\" including reducing waiting times - and urged all parties to find a quick solution.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hulme said he would be concerned if the currently separate strike action by nurses and junior doctors was co-ordinated at any stage.\n\n\"It just fills me with a lot of anxiety and it's almost something I can't comprehend,\" he said.\n\n\"Being able to run services safely without those two clinal groups of staff I think would be very, very difficult indeed and would increase the risks to patients.\"\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt urged members of the GMB and Unite unions - which represent smaller numbers of NHS staff - to join Unison in accepting the government's offer because it would be \"best for patients and best for staff\".\n\nThe British Medical Association, which represents junior doctors, said it was \"not ruling in or out\" of co-ordinated action with other unions - such as nurses' unions.\n\nDr Vivek Trivedi, the co-chairman of the BMA junior doctors committee, said that if the government refused to negotiate \"we are prepared to strike again\", adding: \"We will consider all options available to us.\"\n\nClint Cooper who is a nurse at Scarborough Hospital said he believed in the principles of what his colleagues were doing, but he decided to vote against strike action in the RCN ballot.\n\n\"Last week I had two patients who were very poorly and I wonder if I hadn't been there and escalated it, would they still be alive if I had walked out and that's my conscience talking to me,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow RCN member Diane Cawood voted to reject the government's latest pay offer, describing the staffing situation as \"dire\" and inpatient care as \"dangerous\" at the moment.\n\nThe mental health nurse, whose NHS trust did not meet the threshold to strike, said she enjoyed her work but \"the day may come when I can't afford to stay in this job\".\n\nNurse Clint Cooper said it was not just about pay but\"about the future of the NHS\"\n\nA Unison member who has worked as a nurse for 30 years and voted to accept the government's pay offer said the pressure on staff was \"unsustainable\" but pay was not the fundamental issue.\n\nThe specialist nurse, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that instead retention and recruitment \"presents the greatest challenge to the profession\".\n\nPat Cullen, RCN general secretary and chief executive, said that until there was a significantly improved offer, RCN nurses would be forced to go back to the picket line.\n\nShe said the government \"needs to increase what has already been offered and we will be highly critical of any move to reduce it\".\n\nThe Unison union, which represents some nurses and ambulance crews, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the government's pay offer.\n\nSara Gorton from Unison said health workers would have wanted more \"but this was the best that could be achieved through negotiation\".\n\nMembers have \"opted for the certainty of getting the extra cash in their pockets soon\", she added.\n\nHundreds of thousands of NHS staff from other unions are still voting on the same pay deal over the next two weeks.\n\nIn Scotland, union members have accepted an offer worth an average 6.5% for 2023-24.

So we've recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it's estimated that there are over two million.\"\n\nLaura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\".\n\n\"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.\n\nMarine protected areas could help endangered species like the whale shark - the largest living fish - recover\n\nCountries will need to meet again to formally adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented.\n\nLiz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\"", "Policing in this country is in a state of emergency. The warning lights are flashing. The alarms are wailing.\n\nBaroness Casey says the Metropolitan Police was expecting a report highlighting the things it needed to look at - but that, overall, the force thought she would say it's doing a good job.\n\n\"It's the exact opposite,\" she says.\n\nBaroness Casey has a reputation for no-nonsense reports. When Dame Cressida Dick, the former Scotland Yard Commissioner, asked her to review the Met, she must have known what she would get.\n\nNot the measured, dispassionate and legalistic volumes most institutional inquiries deliver.\n\nHer language is often emotional and uncompromising, a style that appeals to journalists and politicians looking for a headline.\n\nThis report is so ferocious in its criticism that, in the short term, it is almost certain that trust and confidence levels in the police in London - already down - will plummet further.\n\nWith forces across England and Wales, like the Met, re-vetting all their officers, more scandals will emerge.\n\nEvery misconduct hearing, every court case, is going to damage public confidence.\n\nAccused of institutional prejudice, it seems unlikely that, in the short term at least, this report is going to make it easier to recruit women, or those from the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minorities.\n\nMorale is not going to be improved by a report that is so merciless in its criticism of the Met and its culture.\n\nA generation after the Macpherson report found the Metropolitan Police to be institutionally racist, here we are again. Only worse. Sexism and homophobia are added to the list.\n\nThe report notes that in 1972, on his appointment as commissioner of the force, Sir Robert Mark said he had \"never experienced\u2026blindness, arrogance and prejudice on anything like the scale accepted as routine in the Met\".\n\nThe report immediately adds that the Met is a very different organisation today. But five decades on, Louise Casey says: \"We have found those cultures alive and well\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Baroness Casey on her blistering report of the Met police\n\nThe question is really about whether police forces turn things around quickly enough.\n\nThe report talks about reviewing progress against various measures after two and five years. Politicians are suggesting they will want to see results within two years.\n\nBut with a general election likely next year, and manifestos being written even sooner, will politicians show the patience Sir Mark Rowley, the current incumbent in Scotland Yard, says he requires? Especially if more bad headlines see public anxiety increase still further.\n\nBaroness Casey hints at breaking up the Met, if things don't improve. But that kind of major reform of policing feels some way off.\n\nAs things stand, there is no blueprint for a reorganised system in England and Wales - and politicians of all stripes seem content to give Sir Mark the benefit of the doubt for the moment.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has said she will be \"holding the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London to account by measuring progress\", but adds that she currently has \"every confidence that Sir Mark Rowley and his team will deliver\".\n\nSuella Braverman delivering a statement on the Casey report to the Commons on Tuesday\n\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has pointed out that a collapse in trust in the Royal Ulster Constabulary among some communities in Northern Ireland resulted in the successful creation of a new police service, the PSNI.\n\nIs that a hint that a Labour government might institute more radical reform?\n\nParty insiders suggest they will be more hands-on than the current government has been in demanding progress, but there are no plans for systemic change - for now.\n\nWhat does progress look like? Public confidence figures must improve. Recruitment from minorities must increase. Corrupt officers must be identified and booted out. Vetting must be more effective. Whistleblowers must be supported. Morale must rise.\n\nSir Mark has already instituted measures he believes will move the dials. But that will take time. Changing culture and rebuilding trust cannot be done overnight.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the perilous state of British policing right now.\n\nThe tradition of policing by consent - the idea that officers serve as members of the public in uniform, exercising powers with the approval of the people they serve - relies on trust.\n\nBut as Baroness Casey baldly states: \"The Met has become disconnected from Londoners - their consent can no longer be assumed.\"\n\nTrust is formed at the point where the police meet the public. But the report finds bobbies who should be on the beat are behind desks, backfilling for civilian support staff who have been stripped out.\n\n\"The closer the Met get to Londoners, the more beleaguered the service\", is her damning conclusion.\n\nPerhaps the only way to sort out the Met was a nuclear option, a report so damning it takes the force back to ground zero.\n\nBut a huge question remains: Can a new police service emerge from the ashes with the clock ticking?", "Train drivers in the Aslef union have announced a fresh overtime ban, which will see services further disrupted.\n\nDrivers at 15 train companies based in England will refuse to work overtime from Monday 17 to Saturday 22 July.\n\nIt will coincide with strike action by rail workers in the RMT union also taking place later this month.\n\nAnd it follows the overtime ban currently taking place over pay and conditions which is disrupting services across the rail network.\n\nMost train companies rely on drivers working overtime to run their full schedules, which Aslef says is a consequence of operators not employing enough people.\n\nStrikes by other rail workers in the RMT union are set to take place later this month, on 20, 22 and 29 July. Many will reduce their service levels, and passengers are being advised to check before they travel.\n\nAmong the disruption expected this week:\n\nThe announcement of the new overtime ban comes after Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan had warned that further industrial action was likely.\n\nHe told the BBC's Today programme on Monday the Rail Delivery Group's latest pay offer, worth 4% for two years in a row and linked to reforms, was like a return to \"Victorian times\".\n\nThe long-running pay dispute by train drivers centres around union members accepting a deal which would have brought drivers' average pay to \u00a365,000. This offer has already been rejected by Aslef.\n\nBut it would have been dependent on changes to working practices, which the employers and government say are needed to cut costs and modernise how the railway runs.\n\nMr Whelan said the situation was a \"Westminster ideological problem\" and claimed the union did not have issues in Scotland, Wales, with freight, the London Underground, Crossrail or Eurostar.\n\n\"We did 14 pay deals in the last 12 months. The only place we can't get a pay deal is with the Westminster government,\" he added.\n\nThe Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said Aslef had rejected a \"fair and affordable offer\" without putting it to its members.\n\n\"We ask Aslef to recognise the very real financial challenge the industry is facing and work with us to deliver a better, more reliable railway with a strong long-term future,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, the strike action between operators and the RMT over pay, jobs and conditions has lasted for more than a year.\n\nWith only 12% of tickets sold from ticket offices according to the RDG, train companies are preparing to move ahead with plans to close hundreds of station kiosks.\n\nUnder proposed changes staff would be moved on to concourses to help and advise more customers, an RDG spokesperson said.\n\nBut RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said last week his union would not \"meekly sit by and allow thousands of jobs to be sacrificed or see disabled and vulnerable passengers left unable to use the railways as a result\".\n\nThe union suggested it could take further industrial action over the issue.", "Peter Flavel said the handling of Mr Farage's case had \"fallen below the bank's high standards\"\n\nThe boss of Coutts, the prestigious private bank for the wealthy, has stepped down over the handling of Nigel Farage's bank account closure.\n\nNatWest - which owns Coutts - said Peter Flavel's resignation had been mutually agreed and would be immediate.\n\nMr Flavel said how the bank handled Mr Farage's account had \"fallen below\" its \"high standards of personal service\".\n\nMr Farage said \"ultimate responsibility for the dossier de-banking me for my political views\" lay with Mr Flavel.\n\nThe departure of the Coutts boss comes after Dame Alison Rose, the boss of NatWest Group, resigned over the row on Wednesday.\n\nNatWest, which is 39% owned by the taxpayer, has been under fire after Dame Alison admitted she had made a mistake in speaking about Mr Farage's relationship with Coutts.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Flavel said it was \"right that I bear ultimate responsibility for this, which is why I am stepping down\".\n\nPaul Thwaite, Dame Alison's interim replacement at the top of NatWest, said Mr Flavel's departure was \"the right decision for Coutts and the wider group\".\n\nMohammad Kamal Syed is set to take over as the boss of Coutts on an interim basis.\n\nIn early July, Mr Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party and a prominent Brexiteer, said that his account at private bank Coutts had been closed and that he had not been given a reason.\n\nThe BBC reported that it was closed because he no longer met the wealth threshold for Coutts, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nHowever, Mr Farage later obtained a report from the Bank which indicated his political views were also considered.\n\nThe 40-page document flagged concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\", and also questioned the reputational risk of having Mr Farage as a client. It said that to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts' \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".\n\nThe former UKIP leader said it was \"only a matter of time before Peter Flavel, Coutts CEO, stood down\".\n\n\"I even wrote to Mr Flavel twice before going public and didn't receive an acknowledgment,\" he added.\n\nMr Farage also posted on social media screenshots of emails he said he sent to Mr Flavel, one of which stated he had planned to show up at Coutts with a \"security van to collect [redacted] approx in cash\".\n\nLabour's Ed Miliband told the BBC Newscast podcast that the row was a \"bad episode\" for NatWest and Coutts but added we need to \"move on\".\n\nThe shadow climate change and net zero secretary said it was \"right\" for NatWest boss Dame Alison to resign, but added: \"When people try and then sort of make it into a sort of grand conspiracy against lots of people, I sort of slightly part company with it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I think it was bad, it shouldn't have happened but let's not blow it up into sort of the biggest thing ever.\"\n\nThe fallout from Mr Farage having his bank account closed has raised questions over whether banks can terminate accounts due to a person's political views.\n\nThe law states that every person in the UK has a legal right to hold a basic bank account, and that banks \"must not discriminate against consumers\" for a list of reasons such as sex, race, religion and also political beliefs.\n\nThe government met bank bosses on Wednesday who agreed to reforms on the closure of customer accounts.", "Boris Johnson could be denied a parliamentary pass, after a report found he deliberately misled Parliament over the Partygate scandal.\n\nHe would normally be offered one as a former MP, having stood down from Parliament in fury last week after seeing an advance copy of the report.\n\nIn any case, he will still be entitled to a number of perks - most of them related to his role as a former prime minister.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what he can expect in his life outside the House of Commons.\n\nHe will lose his annual MP salary of \u00a386,584 - but he's unlikely to be short of a bob or two, having earned around \u00a36m since standing down as PM last September, mainly from speaking engagements.\n\nHe's entitled to both an MP and ministerial pension at some point, which are administered under different schemes.\n\nHe would also have been automatically entitled to a severance payment of around \u00a319,000 when he left Downing Street.\n\nAs a former MP, he will be able to claim for costs incurred in leaving Parliament, including closing down constituency offices.\n\nBut he won't be able to claim the separate payment available to MPs leaving at a general election, equal to two months' net pay, or around \u00a39,800.\n\nAnd he won't be able to claim the loss-of-office payment for those who lose their seat at an election, which averaged \u00a35,250 after the 2019 poll.\n\nFormer prime ministers continue to receive publicly-funded security from specialist police protection officers.\n\nThey are also entitled to an official chauffeur-driven government car.\n\nBoris Johnson has been hitting the speaking circuit since leaving Downing Street\n\nFormer ministers are entitled to public funding for legal support if they are sued over decisions they took whilst in government.

now an environment minister - would have to explain the report's criticism of his \"shortcomings\".\n\nTory colleague Baroness Warsi said Ms Ghani felt \"unsupported\" over how her allegations were handled, and it had made her question her future in politics.\n\nThe peer, who made history as the first Muslim woman cabinet minister, told BBC Radio 4's PM there were \"many anomalies\" in the inquiry, and she didn't accept it was \"one person's word against the other\".\n\nMs Ghani's allegations centre on a reshuffle in 2020 during Boris Johnson's tenure as prime minister, during which she lost her ministerial post at the transport department.\n\nShe later told the Sunday Times that, after she had asked for an explanation, she was told her \"'Muslimness' was raised as an 'issue', that my 'Muslim women minister' status was making colleagues uncomfortable\".\n\nShe did not identify who had told her this - but Mr Spencer, who was then Tory chief whip, in charge of party discipline, tweeted that Ms Ghani was referring to him, but her claims were \"completely false\".\n\nIt triggered an inquiry into the claims in January 2022, initially led by Mr Johnson's ethics adviser Lord Geidt and then subsequently taken on by Sir Laurie Magnus.\n\nIn a report published on Thursday, Sir Laurie said Ms Ghani and Mr Spencer had \"firm but very different recollections\" of what he had told her in meetings.\n\nThe \"differing evidence\" presented, he added, meant he could not conclude with \"sufficient confidence what was or was not said\".\n\nSir Laurie added that advisers who were present at the time of Ms Ghani's sacking, and interviewed during the probe, said they did not hear conversations in which her faith was discussed.\n\nHe therefore concluded that there was not enough evidence to show Mr Spencer had broken rules that say ministers must be professional in their dealings with colleagues.\n\nMark Spencer was in charge of Tory party discipline under Boris Johnson\n\nHe criticised \"shortcomings\" in Mr Spencer's conduct after the claims emerged, including failing to mention a March 2020 meeting he had with Ms Ghani ahead of a meeting with Mr Johnson that year to discuss the claims.\n\nSir Laurie said Mr Spencer \"has indicated that the omission was an oversight\" - but it was \"not helpful\".\n\nThe adviser also said he should have \"taken more care\" before tweeting, inaccurately, that Ms Ghani's claims had been dismissed during a separate investigation into Islamophobia within the Conservative Party by an academic.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"It's taken three years for a broken system to reach this unsatisfactory conclusion.\n\n\"Rishi Sunak has kept the rotten, toothless ethics regime of his predecessors and failed to set a standard that the public would expect.\n\n\"After all the denials, Mark Spencer was found to have misled the former prime minister and the public but still considered fit to be a minister by Rishi Sunak.\"", "As someone covering the Oscars for the first time it was a surreal experience to see so many people you recognise all in one place, out having a good time.\n\nObviously the big story of the night was Everything Everywhere All at Once and Michelle Yeoh winning best actress in a leading role.

fight proposals to build a network of pylons through the Scottish Highlands.\n\nEnergy firm SSEN has put forward plans for a new powerline between Spittal in Caithness, in the far north of Scotland, to Beauly, near Inverness.\n\nThe plans are seen as critical in moving renewable energy generated in the Highlands to the rest of the UK.\n\nThe Strathpeffer and Contin Better Cable Route Group say they want a less disruptive route for the line.\n\nSSEN said that although the Spittal to Beauly corridor has been identified as the best route in this area, \"no specific overhead line route alignment\" has been identified.\n\nThe Strathpeffer and Contin campaigners want a third party to be brought in to work with both SSEN and local residents.\n\nGroup spokesman Dan Bailey, who lives in Strathpeffer, said: \"This will absolutely destroy the thing that brings people to the area.\n\n\"We are on the edge of the Highlands, we are a scenic location, we have got campsites, we have got hotels, mountain bike businesses, walking guides, wildlife watching - all of these things feed into the local economy.\n\n\"All of these things are under threat if you plough the line through the wrong part of our area.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to try to trigger a public inquiry if the preferred route is just bulldozed through regardless of local feeling.\"\n\nMr Bailey claimed residents of both Strathpeffer and the nearby village of Contin \"feel like we are going to be collateral damage in the national drive to net zero\".\n\nJohn Mackenzie, the Earl of Cromartie and the current chief of Clan Mackenzie, is among those voicing concerns.\n\nHe said: \"This is not a wasteland, this is an area of natural beauty where people come to live because it is a good place to bring children up, to work and to appreciate just how wonderful it is.\n\n\"In Europe, power lines running across areas of outstanding scenery would be undergrounded, so why not here?\"\n\nSSEN Transmission said the project was part of a UK-wide programme of works that are required to meet 2030 renewable targets.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We remain fully committed to work closely with the local community and wider stakeholders to help inform our design.\n\n\"It is important to note that the project remains in the early stages of development and no specific overhead line route alignments have been

damages after he was tortured into admitting killing a British soldier in 1972.\n\nLiam Holden was subjected to waterboarding techniques while in military custody and his treatment led to a confession, the High Court ruled.\n\nHis conviction for murdering Private Frank Bell was quashed a decade ago.\n\nThe last man in the UK sentenced to hang, Mr Holden died last September, aged 68.\n\nHis death penalty was commuted and he was released 17 years into a 40-year sentence, the rest of which he spent on licence.\n\nHe always maintained he was hooded, waterboarded and had a gun pointed at his head before wrongly admitting to shooting Private Bell.\n\nMr Holden's murder conviction was finally quashed in 2012, and he was then awarded \u00a31m for losses suffered due to the miscarriage of justice.\n\nDelivering Friday's ruling in the damages case against the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the judge said Mr Holden genuinely believed he was going to be killed.\n\nWith paratroopers having wrongly and unlawfully induced him to make the admission, the MoD was held liable for his malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office.\n\n\"The plaintiff was subjected to waterboarding; he was hooded; he was driven in a car flanked by soldiers to a location where he thought he would be assassinated,\" said the judge.\n\n\"A gun was put to his head and he was threatened that he would be shot dead.\n\nLiam Holden, aged 18, was taken into police custody in 1972\n\n\"Hooding of the plaintiff, in the circumstances as alleged, constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the [European Convention on Human Rights],\" he said.\n\nThe judge said that while the soldiers had an \"honest belief\" they were acting lawfully they knew their actions would injure Mr Holden and \"unquestionably acted in bad faith\".\n\nTheir actions left Mr Holden with significant psychological effects, said the judge.\n\nAccording to the Holden family and their solicitor, this was the first time a court had found waterboarding took place during The Troubles.\n\nAfter the ruling, the family expressed sadness and relief.\n\n\"My father is not here to see this finished,\" his son Samuel Bowden told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.\n\n\"What he went through should never have happened... today it's all clear that he was innocent.\"\n\nAt a previous court hearing, Mr Holden gave his account of his treatment by soldiers after his arrest.\n\nHe said he was pinned to the floor while a towel was placed over his face.\n\n\"They started pouring a bucket of water slowly through the towel,\" he said.\n\n\"The first thing I felt was the cold, then trying to breathe and then sucking water in through my mouth and up my nose.\n\n\"It was like you were just drowning.\"\n\nSamuel Bowden (right) said the ruling left the family with a sense of sadness and relief\n\nHe said that up to four sessions of questioning and waterboarding were carried out.\n\nMr Holden was then hooded, dragged out of a chair and taken to a loyalist area of Belfast.\n\n\"While we were driving one of the soldiers was tapping my knee with a gun, saying: 'This is for you',\" he told the court.\n\n\"They took me out of the car and brought me into a field, put a gun to my head and said if I didn't admit to shooting the soldier they would shoot me.\"\n\nAsked by his barrister how he had responded to the alleged threat, Mr Holden replied: \"I just said: 'I shot the soldier.'\n\n\"[I] made a cock-and-bull story about where I shot him from, where I got the weapon, where I dumped the weapon and how I got away.\"\n\nA forensic psychiatrist who examined Mr Holden in 2016 said he described being plagued by nightmares more frightening than any real-life experience.\n\nHis son Samuel said his criminal record made it difficult to get work, leave the country or just \"get a normal life going\".", "Singer-songwriter Linda Lewis, whose career spanned more

Gaming deal block is \"darkest day in our four decades in Britain\", says Microsoft's boss Brad Smith\n\nMicrosoft's president has attacked the UK after it was blocked from buying US gaming firm Activision, saying the EU was a better place to start a business.\n\nThe move was \"bad for Britain\" and marked Microsoft's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in the country, Brad Smith told the BBC.\n\nThe regulator hit back saying it had to do what's best for people, \"not merging firms with commercial interests\".\n\nThe UK's move means the multi-billion dollar deal cannot go ahead globally.\n\nAlthough US and EU regulators have yet to decide on whether to approve the deal, the UK regulator the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said: \"Activision is intertwined through different markets - it can't be separated for the UK. So this decision blocks the deal from happening globally.\"\n\nIf it had been approved, the $68.7bn (\u00a355bn) deal would have been the gaming industry's biggest ever takeover, and would have seen Microsoft get hold of massively popular games titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush and World of Warcraft.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Activision have said they will appeal against the CMA's decision.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Wake up to Money programme, Mr Smith said Microsoft was \"very disappointed\" with the CMA's decision, \"but more than that, unfortunately, I think it's bad for Britain\".\n\n\"It does more than shake our confidence in the future of the opportunity to grow a technology business in Britain than we've ever confronted before,\" he said.\n\n\"People are shocked, people are disappointed, and people's confidence in technology in the UK has been severely shaken.\n\n\"There's a clear message here - the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business than the United Kingdom.\"\n\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Smith was wrong to say the CMA's decision was bad for Britain and that the EU was a better place to do business.\n\n\"Those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts,\" the spokesman said, adding that the UK games sector had doubled in size over the last 10 years.\n\nThe government would continue to engage with Microsoft, he said, but pointed out that the CMA was independent.\n\nFor the deal to work, it has to be approved by regulators in the UK, the US and the EU.\n\nThe UK is the first to announce its decision, but the US Federal Trade Commission last year began a legal challenge to block the takeover.\n\nIn March, EU regulators delayed their decision after Microsoft proposed concessions to get the deal over the line.\n\nActivision Blizzard makes hit games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush\n\nThe UK government has made it one of its post-Brexit goals to bring in a \"light-touch\" set of rules for science and technology to encourage economic growth.\n\nHowever, a number of recent takeovers of British firms by overseas ones has increased concerns that the UK market is declining in importance, and is failing to attract fast-growing tech firms.\n\nMicrosoft has already said the decision may have an impact on its UK investment.\n\nMr Smith said that if the UK wants to bring in investment, then \"it needs to look hard at the role of the CMA and the regulatory structure\".\n\nThe CMA's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, told the Today programme that she did not agree with Mr Smith's comments.\n\n\"I think this decision shows actually how important it is to support competition in the UK and that the UK is absolutely open for business,\" she said.\n\n\"We want to create an environment where a whole host of different companies can compete effectively, can grow and innovate.\"\n\nIn its ruling on Wednesday the regulator said it was concerned the deal would hit innovation and give gamers less choice in the fast-growing cloud gaming market, where people buy subscriptions to access games online.\n\nThe merger is important for Microsoft because it sees cloud gaming as the future of the industry and wants to strengthen its position in the market.\n\nThe Activision deal would also give it some very popular games titles, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Sony.\n\nSony's position is that if the deal went ahead, Microsoft would have an incentive to restrict access to Activision's titles to PlayStation, which would be bad for gamers.\n\nThe CMA said Microsoft already had a 60-70% share of the cloud gaming market, and combining with Activision would \"really reinforce... [its] strong position\".\n\n\"That would be problematic because it would really harm the ability of other competing cloud platforms to compete effectively and offer the kind of innovation and product choice that we want to see in this market,\" Ms Cardell said.\n\nGareth Sutcliffe, senior games analyst at Enders Analysis, said Microsoft had misjudged its approach.\n\n\"The signs were clear for months that this deal was in trouble with UK regulators and yet Microsoft executives didn't prioritise it or heed the evidence that it was,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMr Sutcliffe added that Mr Smith's comments about the UK were \"somewhat redundant\".\n\n\"They [Microsoft] had ample opportunity to do things differently over the past 16 months - they've not provided a convincing enough case.\"", "Pope Francis has faced a series of health issues in recent\n\nPope Francis has undergone abdominal surgery \"without complications\", the Vatican says.\n\nThe hernia operation at Rome's Gemelli hospital lasted three hours.

Watch: Danish reporters film armed men on guard as they approach the Admiral Vladimirsky\n\nRussia has a programme to sabotage wind farms and communication cables in the North Sea, according to new allegations.\n\nThe details come from a joint investigation by public broadcasters in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.\n\nIt says Russia has a fleet of vessels disguised as fishing trawlers and research vessels in the North Sea.\n\nThey carry underwater surveillance equipment and are mapping key sites for possible sabotage.\n\nThe BBC understands that UK officials are aware of Russian vessels moving around UK waters as part of the programme.\n\nThe first of a series of reports is due to be broadcast on Wednesday by DR in Denmark, NRK in Norway, SVT in Sweden and Yle in Finland.\n\nThe report focuses on a Russian vessel called the Admiral Vladimirsky\n\nA Danish counter-intelligence officer says the sabotage plans are being prepared in case of a full conflict with the West while the head of Norwegian intelligence told the broadcasters the programme was considered highly important for Russia and controlled directly from Moscow.\n\nThe broadcasters say they have analysed intercepted Russian communications which indicate so-called ghost ships sailing in Nordic waters which have turned off the transmitters so as not to reveal their locations.\n\nThe report focuses on a Russian vessel called the Admiral Vladimirsky. Officially, this is an Expeditionary Oceanographic Ship, or underwater research vessel. But the report alleges that it is in fact a Russian spy ship.\n\nThe documentary uses an anonymous former UK Royal Navy expert to track the movements of the vessel in the vicinity of seven wind farms off the coast of the UK and the Netherlands on one mission.\n\nIt says the vessel slows down when it approaches areas where there are wind farms and loiters in the area. It says it sailed for a month with its transmitter turned off.\n\nWhen a reporter approached the ship on a small boat, he was confronted by a masked individual carrying what appeared to be a military assault rifle.\n\nThe same ship was reportedly sighted off the Scottish coast last year. It was spotted entering the Moray Firth on 10 November and seen about 30 nautical miles east of Lossiemouth, home to the RAF's Maritime Patrol Aircraft fleet before heading slowly west.\n\nThe BBC understands that UK officials are aware of Russian intent to conduct what is known as undersea mapping, including using boats that move around in UK waters.\n\nIf there are specific threats against the UK these would be investigated, but sources declined to say what activity might have been looked at so far.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The head of the country's military intelligence said a Russian ship had been detected near a wind farm in the North Sea and was mapping out sites.\n\n\"We saw in recent months Russian actors tried to uncover how the energy system works in the North Sea. It is the first time we have seen this,\" General Jan Swillens said.\n\nReconnaissance of sensitive sites is not unusual and Western countries will likely be carrying out similar activity against Russia. The intention is likely to have a series of options available should a conflict escalate.\n\nOne option might be to damage communications or take down countries' power systems to cause chaos.\n\nSo far the evidence of actual sabotage rather than just intelligence gathering for the possibility is more limited.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian officials dismissed the claims in the documentary as baseless, AFP news agency reported.\n\nThe filmmakers approached Russian ambassadors in four Nordic countries for comment - but only Norway's responded.\n\nTeimuraz Ramishvili told them that Norwegian authorities had made a habit of accusing Russia of espionage, hacker attacks and other undercover operations without providing any evidence.\n\nHe insisted that Russian vessels were following Norwegian rules and had the right to sail in Norwegian waters.\n\nThe report raises the possibility that such vessels were linked to an incident south of Svalbard last year when an underwater data cable was cut.\n\nThe cable served the world largest commercial ground station for satellite communications. Norwegian police have said they believe \"human activity\" was behind the sabotage but have not officially accused anyone.\n\nOn 13 April this year, Norway expelled 15 Russian officials, accusing them of spying. It was the latest in a wave of expulsions across Europe since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn October last year police declared a major incident in the Shetland Islands after a cable was cut.\n\nThe incident severely hampered communications with the mainland and was blamed at the time as having been probably caused by \"fishing vessels\". Cables are regularly cut by accident and so far the BBC understands this is not thought to have been the result of hostile activity.\n\nThere had been one clear and significant act of sabotage and that was the destruction last September of parts of the Nord Stream pipeline designed to carry gas from Russia to Europe.\n\nAt the time, many accused Russia of being responsible but since then other reports have suggested other possibilities, including pro-Ukrainian actors, and investigations are ongoing.\n\nRussian military intelligence, the GRU, has also been linked to both sabotage and poisonings. A GRU team linked to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 with Novichok nerve agent was also linked to the blowing up of an arms depot in a Czech forest.", "A South African accountant who was investigating high-level corruption cases has been shot dead along with his son.\n\nCloete Murray, 50, was the liquidator for Bosasa, a company implicated in numerous government contract scandals.\n\nHe also worked as a liquidator for firms linked to the wealthy Gupta brothers, who deny bribery accusations.\n\nPolice will see if there is a link between Mr Murray's murder and these corruption investigations.\n\nMr Murray was shot by unknown gunmen while driving in Johannesburg with his 28-year-old son Thomas, a legal adviser, on Saturday.\n\nHis son died at the scene while Mr Murray was taken to hospital and later died of his injuries, local media reported, citing a police spokesperson.\n\nThe pair were driving their white Toyota Prado towards their home in Pretoria, South African media reported.\n\nMr Murray's job as a court-appointed company liquidator was to look into the accounts of firms that had folded, recover assets, and report any criminality.\n\nOne of those companies was Bosasa, a government contractor specialising in prison services.\n\nThe landmark Zondo commission into corruption concluded the company extensively bribed politicians and government officials to get government contracts during the nine-year presidency of Jacob Zuma, from 2009 to 2018.\n\nMr Zuma refused to co-operate with the inquiry but has denied accusations of corruption.\n\nIn 2018, current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would repay a $35,000 (\u00a327,300) donation from Bosasa.\n\nAn anti-corruption investigator found he had misled parliament over the donation, but that finding was dismissed by the country's High Court.\n\nMr Ramaphosa has also faced other corruption allegations, which he denies.\n\nBosasa went into voluntary liquidation after banks closed its accounts.\n\nMr Murray was also working as a liquidator for firms linked to the Gupta brothers. The Zondo commission found that the brothers - Ajay, Rajesh and Atul - tried to influence political and economic decisions during Mr Zuma's presidency in a process known as \"state capture\".\n\nThe Guptas moved from India to South Africa in 1993 and owned a wide-ranging portfolio of companies that enjoyed lucrative contracts with South African government departments and state-owned companies.\n\nThe South African authorities are currently working on having the Gupta brothers extradited from the UAE, where they have been arrested, to stand trial.\n\nThey have denied accusations of paying financial bribes to win contracts.", "Crews from Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue and Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Service carried out searches\n\nA body has been found in the search for a 17-year-old boy who went missing in a river, police have confirmed.\n\nGloucestershire Police was called at about 22:00 BST on Sunday after the boy was spotted in the River Thames near Lechlade on Thames.\n\nA group of five had been at the location together, and some had entered the water to try to find him.\n\nThe others have been accounted for and the death is not being treated as suspicious.\n\nThe National Police Air Service, Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service and Severn Area Rescue Association carried out searches into the early hours of Monday.\n\nSearches continued throughout Monday and a body was later recovered from the river by specialist police divers from Avon and Somerset Police.\n\nFive teenage boys had been playing in the river, but the others have been accounted for\n\nAlthough formal identification has not yet taken place, the boy's next of kin have been informed and they are being supported by trained officers.\n\nGloucestershire Constabulary has said its thoughts were with the boy's family and friends at this distressing time.\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But she is just one of many civilians still in the city who are paying with their lives as the fighting continues to rage despite the latest ceasefire.\n\nZeinab Mohammed Salih is a journalist living in Omdurman, next to the Sudanese capital - she describes daily life for people caught up in the conflict.\n\nAsia Abdelmajid, who was born in 1943, was famous for her theatre performances - first coming to prominence in a production of the play Pamseeka 58 years ago.\n\nIt was put on at the national theatre in Omdurman to mark the anniversary of Sudan's first revolution against a coup leader. She was considered a pioneer of the stage - and the country's first professional stage actress, later retiring to become a teacher.\n\nHer family say she was buried within hours of her shooting on Wednesday morning in the grounds of a kindergarten where she had been most recently working. It was too dangerous to take her to a cemetery.\n\nIt is not clear who fired the shot that killed her in the clashes in the northern suburb of Bahri. But paramilitary fighters of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are ensconced in their bases in residential areas across the city, continue to battle the army, which tends to attack from the air.\n\nThe RSF says the military tried to deploy members of the police's special force unit on Wednesday - but the group alleges it rebuffed their ground offensive.\n\nThe UN's top aid official has warned that the \"will to end the fight still was not there\" after speaking to Sudan's rival military leaders.\n\nWith a military jet flying overhead as I write and WhatsApp messages arriving with more bad news of my friends caught up in the fighting, it feels like neither side is serious about ending their deadly confrontation.\n\n\"I was sitting with my brother in the sitting room when we heard the loud noise of the shell and the dust coming from the kitchen - we thought the whole wall had just collapsed,\" my friend Mohamed el-Fatih, a fellow journalist, told me.\n\nHis apartment in Burri, east of the army's headquarters in central Khartoum, was bombed on Monday night.\n\n\"My neighbours upstairs and downstairs were terrified and screaming, we had to evacuate immediately to another area.\"\n\nHis suburb is completely occupied by the RSF and rockets are often fired from the military headquarters where it is believed Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army chief, and his aides are staying.\n\nMy friend Hiba el-Rayeh has also just been in contact in great distress after her mother Sohair Abdallah el-Basher, a respected lawyer, and two uncles were killed last Thursday by a shell that came from a bridge over the River Nile directed towards the Presidential Palace. They were living close by.\n\nHer uncles had actually come to help them escape during one of last week's so-called humanitarian ceasefires.\n\nCentral Khartoum has been devastated by almost three weeks of fighting\n\nIn another suburb called Khartoum 2, to the west of the military headquarters, estate agent Omer Belal has decided to stay and guard his home.\n\nThe 46-year-old has sent his family to a safer district while he and a few other men in the neighbourhood seek to protect their properties from the looting and armed robbery that is occurring across the city.\n\nPeople's houses, banks, factories, supermarkets and clothing shops are all being ransacked.\n\nAnother friend, who asked not to be named, spent five days in a restaurant in Khartoum 2 when the battles first broke out on 15 April.\n\nHe managed to escape during the first shaky ceasefire. First he went to the north of the city then decided to go overland to Ethiopia, a trip that took five days.\n\nNow in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, he messaged to say he had seen piles of bodies as he left Khartoum 2.\n\nBasil Omer, a medic and volunteer, described fleeing his flat when it was shelled in al-Manshiya, east of the army headquarters.\n\n\"We spent three days only sleeping on the ground.

Some Green politicians said while they disagreed with the group's radical actions, they suggested the raids may have been too heavy-handed.\n\nLeft-wing and environmental groups announced a march in Berlin on Wednesday afternoon with further demonstrations in Leipzig, Munich and Potsdam.

He had quietly flown back to the UK to make what had clearly been planned as a dramatic entrance.\n\nNo-one had expected him to appear in person for a week of what were billed to be complex legal arguments about whether seven well-known people should be allowed to sue Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail titles.\n\nThe duke's manifesto is clear. As he writes in his book, Spare, \"it's about not letting people get away with abuse, and lies. Especially the kind of lies that can destroy innocents\".\n\nFor several days he sat on the padded seats of court 76 listening to what was said, writing in a black notebook and occasionally passing notes to his lawyers. The actor Sadie Frost sat next to him, another of the seven.\n\nJournalists, a breed the duke appears to loathe, sat yards away, and it became routine to file out of the court for lunch breaks with Prince Harry and his close protection detail joining the hungry queue for the exit.\n\nAlso there at times were Sir Elton John, his husband David Furnish, and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, who, along with Sir Simon Hughes and Elizabeth Hurley, are also claiming breaches of privacy by the newspapers. They seemed prepared to endure the more uncomfortable plastic seats of the court - although Mr Furnish seemed to have more stamina than Sir Elton.\n\nThe allegations are eye-watering. Nineteen private investigators are alleged to have placed phone taps on landlines, taped microphones to windows, bugged cars, intercepted voicemail, blagged information ranging from bank statements to flight details, and put their targets under surveillance. They are said to have worked for around 80 journalists on the two Associated Newspapers titles.\n\nThe publisher denies the allegations, branding the claims \"preposterous smears\".\n\nThe venue was appropriate. Eleven years ago, in the identical court 73 one floor below, Lord Justice Leveson heard months of evidence during his public inquiry into press standards, relevant to the current case in two important ways.\n\nFirst, in front of Lord Justice Leveson, Associated Newspapers repeatedly denied on oath that it had commissioned illegal methods of gathering private information. Second, the inquiry was given records of payments made by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators.\n\nDuring this week's hearings the judge was considering whether the payment records, held confidentially by the Leveson Inquiry, could be used in this case, and whether the whole thing should be thrown out because of a legal time limit.\n\nBarristers for the seven said they had been put off taking legal action because of the vehement denials by the newspapers at the public inquiry. Only recently, they argued, had real evidence come forward.\n\nSir Elton John also attended court earlier in the week\n\nThis case is hugely important because Associated Newspapers has always strongly denied paying for this sort of illegal newsgathering. A decade after law firms began suing rival titles The Sun, News of the World, and Mirror for millions in damages resulting from phone hacking, Associated Newspapers has remained untouched.\n\nThe publisher's reputation is at stake - and its bottom line. News UK, which owns The Sun, has paid an estimated \u00a31bn in damages and legal costs during the hacking cases. Should Associated Newspapers lose this case, sources close to the law firms mounting the legal challenge say there are dozens more famous people waiting to sue.\n\nAssociated Newspapers, represented during the hearings by two \"silks\", or senior barristers, and a row of lawyers frantically scribbling in notebooks or tapping on tablets, has not been shy about proclaiming its innocence.\n\nThe publisher has described the claims as a \"pre-planned and orchestrated attempt\" to drag the Mail titles into the phone-hacking scandal by a coalition of journalists and anti-press campaigners. \"Unsubstantiated\", \"highly defamatory\", and a \"fishing expedition\", the company says of the potential evidence.\n\nIt could take years to resolve. Mr Justice Nicklin, regarded as one of the judiciary's leading media judges, promised on Thursday to decide as quickly as he could whether this case can continue, but in the law, quickly almost certainly means weeks.\n\nAnd that's just the start. Should the judge keep the case alive, the claimants will be able to get disclosure of key documents. There will be battles about that process.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThere are likely to be skirmishes about which evidence should be heard in the case. One private investigator, Gavin Burrows, made a witness statement in 2021 making lurid admissions of his \"unlawful\" activities on behalf of the newspapers.\n\nBy 2023 his story appeared to have changed. He had never worked for the Mail and Mail on Sunday, he said in a new statement.\n\nListening to some of the potential evidence this week, there was a feeling of looking back on a different era - where the landline phone number of a celebrity was journalistic gold dust to a showbiz reporter. A time where it is alleged cassette recorders were used to secretly record phone calls, taped to the inside of a junction box. A time when tabloid scandals were delivered on newsprint.\n\nThe world has changed. Much of the information it is claimed newspapers were desperate to get their hands on is now freely available on social media - published by the celebrities themselves.", "Rachel Reeves wants to be the next Chancellor.

Its focus has instead been on providing military support on land.\n\nSome Nato member countries have expressed worries that handing jets to Ukraine would be viewed as escalating the war, risking a direct confrontation with Russia.\n\nSenior US military officials were previously sceptical about the ability of Western-supplied fighter jets to dramatically alter the conflict - there are lots of air defence systems on the ground, and Russia's large air force has struggled to gain air superiority.\n\nIn February, President Biden told reporters that he was \"ruling out for now\" sending advanced fighters to Ukraine.\n\nBut Mr Sullivan told reporters that the US had provided weapons to Kyiv as they were needed on the battlefield, and the decision to pave the way for fighter jets indicated the conflict had entered a new phase.\n\n\"Now we have delivered everything we said we were going to deliver, so we put the Ukrainians in a position to make progress on the battlefield through the counteroffensive. We've reached a moment where it is time to look down the road, and say what is Ukraine going to need as part of a future force to defend against Russian aggression,\" he said.\n\nMr Sullivan also indicated any jets Ukraine received would only be used for defence purposes, and that the US would neither enable nor support attacks on Russian territory.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have consistently indicated that they are prepared to follow through on that,\" he said.\n\nWhile the change in US policy is significant, training pilots to fly F-16 jets will take time.\n\nUkraine has more trained fighter pilots than aircraft at present, but even training experienced fighter pilots on a new plane could take up to four months.\n\nNations will also need to agree to supply the jets.\n\nThe F-16 is widely used by a number of European and Middle East nations as well as the US, which still manufactures the aircraft.\n\nThe UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark also welcomed the US move.\n\nMr Zelensky is joining the G7 leaders in Japan\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted: \"The UK will work together with the USA and the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark to get Ukraine the combat air capability it needs.\"\n\nThe UK does not have any F-16s in its air force itself.\n\nDenmark has announced it too will now be able to support the training of pilots, but did not confirm whether it would send any jets to Ukraine. Denmark's air force has 40 F-16s, around 30 of which are operational.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Sunak and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said they would build an \"international coalition\" to provide fighter jet support for Ukraine.\n\nMr Sunak said the UK would set up a flight school to train Ukrainian pilots. French leader Emmanuel Macron said his country was willing to do the same but would not provide jets.\n\nSome of the opposition to sending the jets has centred around maintenance issues, with former Nato official Dr Jamie Shea saying they require extensive maintenance after almost every fight.\n\nAt the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine was believed to have around 120 combat capable aircraft - mainly consisting of aging Soviet-era MiG-29s and Su-27s.\n\nBut officials say they need up to 200 jets to match Moscow's air-power - which is thought to be five or six times greater than Kyiv's.\n\nMr Zelensky has primarily been asking its allies for F-16s. First built in the 1970s, the jet can travel at twice the speed of sound and can engage targets in the air or on the ground.\n\nWhile now eclipsed by the more modern F-35, it remains widely in use. Experts say modern fighters like the F-16 would help Ukraine strike behind Russian lines.\n\nEarlier this year some Eastern European countries sent Soviet-era Mig fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.", "China's largest car manufacturer SAIC Motor says it will build its first factory in Europe, after sales of its vehicles on the continent jumped.\n\nThe state-controlled company - which owns the iconic MG brand - says the new plant will produce electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson told the BBC that SAIC has not yet decided whether MG models would be made at the site.\n\nMG, which has roots dating back over a century, was made in the UK until production was moved to China in 2016.\n\nOn Thursday, an SAIC spokesperson told the BBC that the firm was still in the process of securing a site in Europe and finalising other details about the project.\n\n\"We have many brands including MG, IM and Maxus. We are still deciding which will be built at the factory,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nSales of its vehicles outside China surged by 40% in the first three months of the year, according to SAIC.\n\nThe MG brand accounted for the majority of overseas sales, as the number of the cars sold in Europe more than doubled in the same period, the company said.\n\nThe latest announcement comes almost seven years after SAIC halted MG assembling at the Longbridge plant in Birmingham.\n\nIn 2016, MG said assembly in the UK was no longer \"required\" and that cars would arrive in the country \"fully built (and) ready for distribution\".\n\nThe Longbridge plant built cars including MG and the original Mini. It was set up in 1906 and survived World Wars One and Two.\n\nIn the years that followed, the site fought off post-war economic depression and the emergence of the motor industry abroad.\n\nIt also recovered from strike action, mergers, takeovers and drops in its share value.\n\nProduction at the plant was halted after MG Rover collapsed in 2005. The brand was eventually bought by SAIC.\n\nIn 2011, the MG6 was launched. It was the first MG car in 16 years to be assembled at Longbridge.\n\nThe five-seater vehicle was designed in the UK but its parts were made in China.\n\nChinese carmakers - including SAIC, Geely and Great Wall - have seen their market shares grow in recent years.\n\nExports from China have been boosted by the demand for electric vehicles and sales to Russia as many Western countries imposed sanctions on Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nChina exported more than a million vehicles in the first three months of this year, official figures show.

Nicola Sturgeon addresses the Holyrood chamber for the last time as first minister\n\nOn the binary measure of independence, Ms Sturgeon, like Alex Salmond before her, leaves office as a failure. Scotland remains in the United Kingdom.\n\nShe began campaigning for independence as a teenager in 1980s Ayrshire and was just 21 when she first stood for election, unsuccessfully challenging Labour in the working class Glasgow Shettleston constituency under the SNP slogan \"Free by '93\".\n\nThirty years on, the SNP has made great strides towards its goal but Ms Sturgeon's resignation implicitly acknowledges that Scotland will not be \"free\" by '23, or any time soon after.\n\nThe abrupt announcement of her departure set in train a damaging and divisive leadership contest, with splits emerging on economic and social issues as well as on electoral and constitutional strategy.\n\nDiscipline, for which the SNP had been famed, began to crumble.\n\nEven contenders for Ms Sturgeon's crown publicly criticised the lack of progress on independence during her eight years in office.\n\nHumza Yousaf, Kate Forbes and Ash Regan are competing to become the next SNP leader\n\n\"For too many years, we've become the party of referendums rather than the party of independence,\" said Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, who promises to \"turn a divided nation into a settled majority\" for leaving the UK.\n\nAccording to former minister Ash Regan: \"The SNP has lost its way. There's been no progress on independence in the last few years, despite the worst UK governments of all time.\"\n\n\"I think what we are now hearing publicly is what many people have been saying privately for a long time,\" says James Mitchell, professor of public policy at Edinburgh University.\n\nThe SNP's looming crisis deepened when the party admitted that it had covered up a dramatic fall in its membership, prompting the resignations of director of communications, Murray Foote, and chief executive Peter Murrell, who is married to Ms Sturgeon.\n\nAlso following his wife out of government are two of her most trusted lieutenants, senior adviser Liz Lloyd and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.\n\nIt has been a chaotic and painful few weeks for the SNP and yet the final days of the first minister's tenure have been characterised by boosterism and denial.\n\n\"The SNP's not in a mess,\" Ms Sturgeon insisted on ITV's Loose Women. \"It's going through, how can I put this, some growing pains right now.\"\n\nThen there was her denial that SNP president Mike Russell had said the party was in a mess.\n\nMr Russell had answered the question \"Is your party in turmoil?\" with the words: \"Well, I think it's fair to say that there's a tremendous mess and we have to clear it up.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon also insisted that her party had not lied to journalists about its plummeting membership figures despite evidence to the contrary, not least the resignations of Mr Foote and Mr Murrell.\n\nThe whole membership affair was, leadership contender and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told Tuesday's Times Radio debate, a \"total own goal\".\n\nSo, is Nicola Sturgeon's dream of a sovereign Scottish state, standing tall on the world stage, dead and buried?\n\nHistory says don't be so sure.\n\nOn the day the Hollywood epic Braveheart had its American premiere in Seattle, a more peaceful political drama was playing out on the streets of the old country.\n\nThe death of the Conservative MP for Perth and Kinross had triggered a by-election, and the SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham was on the march - and under attack.\n\nA senior Tory accused Ms Cunningham - caricatured as Republican Rose because she opposed the monarchy - of fighting a campaign \"against Queen and country\".\n\nAt 18 years old, I was easily the least experienced journalist on the by-election trail - but even I could see that the Tories were in trouble in territory which they had dominated for decades.\n\nTheir candidate, a gaffe-prone merchant banker, was keen to talk about one topic above all others, campaigning (literally) under the banner: \"A Strong Union\".\n\nYou could understand why. The spoils of Empire; the unifying experience of defying Hitler's Germany; and the creation of the welfare state had all bound Scotland tightly into the union.\n\nRoseanna Cunningham (centre) put independence at the heart of her by-election campaign in 1995\n\nMargaret Thatcher's response, as Conservative prime minister during the 1980s, was to fight and win a war abroad while hastening a profound economic shift at home.\n\nHer vision of a modern British economy meant moving away from state subsidy of heavy industry; weakening the trade unions; and encouraging the creation of wealth through private enterprise.\n\nFor many in Scotland, where culture, tradition and pride were intertwined with coal, steel and textiles, the pace of change was bewildering.\n\nA lack of direct and obvious benefit from the vast quantities of oil being sucked out of the North Sea also contributed to a rise in nationalist sentiment.\n\nBy the time of the Perth and Kinross by-election, Scotland was rediscovering an old identity.\n\nWhen it premiered in Stirling that autumn, Braveheart's romanticisation of the wars of independence from England in the 13th and 14th Centuries seemed in tune with the mood of the moment.\n\nHaving placed independence front and centre in her campaign, Ms Cunningham won handsomely, further reducing Tory Prime Minister John Major's slender majority in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Scotland is waking from its slumber,\" proclaimed the victorious new MP during a feisty and raucous declaration in the city hall.\n\nWas it though? The SNP had scored spectacular by-election successes before \u2014 Motherwell in 1945; Hamilton in 1967; and Glasgow Govan in 1973 and 1988 \u2014 only to lose each seat at the subsequent general election.\n\nThis time was different. Perth remains SNP territory to this day.\n\nThe party may be in trouble now but, with large majorities of younger voters telling pollsters that they support independence, the constitutional question which hangs over Scottish politics is not going away.\n\nIt is a question which Labour, a party forged in the din of Scotland's industrial revolution, has tussled with since its creation.\n\nThe Scottish Labour Party was founded in 1888 by two extraordinary but very different men, the miner and trade unionist Keir Hardie, and the aristocratic adventurer RB Cunninghame Graham.\n\nHardie went on to become the first leader of the UK Labour Party in 1906; Cunninghame Grahame the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934.\n\nThe most fundamental change to Scottish governance in the democratic era was delivered by Labour when the Scottish Parliament took charge of domestic affairs such as health and education in 1999.\n\nBut it was the SNP which benefited most, gradually capturing almost all of the post-industrial seats which Labour had held for decades and, from 2007, taking charge of the Scottish government.\n\nLabour's Donald Dewar was the first first minister of Scotland when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999\n\nNearly a quarter of a century later, Labour is led by Keir Hardie's namesake, Sir Keir Starmer, who spies an opportunity in the SNP's travails.\n\nOn Friday I accompanied Sir Keir, Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar and shadow climate change and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband on a trip to SSE's Beatrice wind farm off the east coast of Caithness.\n\nThe leader of the opposition at Westminster was in buoyant form, and no wonder.\n\nHis party sees the departure of multiple election winner Nicola Sturgeon \u2014 whom he calls a \"giant in Scottish politics\" \u2014 as great news.\n\n\"The SNP is imploding,\" he told me on the harbour side at Wick. \"I think everybody can see that.\"\n\nThe party, he added, \"has run out of road when it comes to the case for independence and that's shone a light on their record\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWith a large and sustained polling lead across the UK, and signs of improvement in Scotland, Labour may be in a positive place but the path to Downing Street is not straight and clear, running through mixed terrain.\n\nFirst, there is the cosmopolitan and multicultural domain of London and other big English cities.\n\nThen there are the more socially conservative, Brexit-inclined \"red wall\" seats, in the Midlands and the north of England, which switched from Labour to Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election.\n\nFinally there is the party's old Scots fiefdom, stretching from Ayrshire in the west through the central belt to Fife in the east, where the SNP have dominated with a pro-independence, pro-European message since 2015.\n\nThe SNP hold 45 of the Scottish 59 seats at Westminster (two more have defected to Alex Salmond's Alba Party since the last general election) but Labour strategists now reckon at least 15 of those would be competitive based on current polling, particularly in Glasgow, Fife, Midlothian and East Lothian.\n\nWith that in mind, on this trip Sir Keir appears to have adopted the doctor's maxim: first, do no harm. In our interview he uses the word \"humility\" a lot.\n\n\"I think Labour lost its way and got too far from voters here in Scotland and that's why I've spent a lot of time in Scotland listening, engaging, talking about the future,\" he says.\n\nPrecisely what he means by getting too far from the voters is not terribly clear.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, Ed Miliband and Anas Sarwar travelled to the Beatrice wind farm off Caithness on Friday\n\nHow would he respect the democratic will of the Scottish people to remain in the European Union, and the pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament?\n\nThe real answer to both questions is, he won't. But that would sound harsh so he adopts softer language.\n\nOn Brexit he says: \"If you want a closer relationship with the EU, I hear you, I agree with you and we will set about ensuring that we do have that close relationship.\"\n\nOn independence he rejects \"breaking up the United Kingdom,\" while recognising that there is a \"desire for change\".\n\nLabour's attempt to defuse independence as an issue is to acknowledge an asymmetry in political and economic power between the prosperous south east of England and other parts of the UK, which it proposes to tackle by embracing some of the recommendations in Gordon Brown's recent commission on the UK's future, while considering whether to adopt others.\n\nAlready on Labour's agenda are House of Lords reform; decentralisation of economic power to the nations and regions of the UK; and improved intergovernmental working between the various administrations of these islands.\n\n\"Decisions should be made by people most closely affected by those decisions,\" says Sir Keir.\n\nIsn't that an argument for independence?\n\nNo, he insists, it's an argument for local decision-making within the UK framework.\n\n\"The people in the Highlands can make decisions in partnership with the Labour government about the future living standards here, the future jobs, the skills we're talking about this morning,\" he explains.\n\nAware of this looming Labour threat, the SNP is keen to conflate Sir Keir's party with Rishi Sunak's, reminding voters that Labour and Tories joined together in the Better Together campaign against independence in 2014.\n\nLabour politicians joined Conservative and Liberal Democrat counterparts to campaign for the union ahead of the 2014 referendum\n\nSir Keir's decision to approvingly quote Margaret Thatcher in a speech on crime while in Stoke this week makes the SNP's job easier while underlining the Labour leader's difficulty in assembling such a diverse electoral coalition.\n\nStill, he can take comfort that his opponents here also face immense challenges.\n\nThe new SNP leader will have to tackle deep-rooted problems in Scotland's public services which are costing and blighting lives.\n\nHe or she will also be under pressure to set out a credible route map towards \u2014 and a credible plan for \u2014 independence.\n\nAnd the winner must also reunite a divided party in time for a general election expected to be held next year in which, it is now clearer than ever, Scotland will be a key battleground.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch the moment a man walks his daughter down the aisle after recovering from a serious brain injury\n\nFarmer Roger Jones was able to walk his daughter down the aisle two years after doctors warned his family he might not survive a brain infection.\n\nSurgeons had to remove part of his skull in 2021, leaving it unlikely the 68-year-old would ever return to the family farm in Castleton, Cardiff.\n\n\"They told us people in Roger's condition end up in long-term care,\" said wife Gill.\n\nBut determination to be there for his daughter helped him walk again.\n\n\"They actually told [my wife] they didn't think I'd live,\" Roger said, remembering how his illness began over Christmas in 2020 when one side of his face started to droop.\n\n\"We thought he'd had a stroke,\" Gill said, but doctors diagnosed a possible bout of shingles.\n\nThen in January 2021 he was diagnosed with a sinus infection that had breached Roger's brain membrane causing an abscess.\n\n\"At that point they weren't sure whether or not he would survive,\" Gill remembered, explaining how because of Covid restrictions she did not see her husband in person for nearly three months after first taking him to hospital.\n\nGill seeing Roger in person for first time in three months in April 2021 and (right) the couple's first night in their own bed, 633 days after he first went into hospital\n\nRoger underwent nine surgeries over a five-month period with surgeons first removing the infected parts of his skull and finally replacing the bone with a titanium plate.\n\n\"It was awful,\" Roger said, admitting he does not remember much from that period, besides worrying about the fate of his farm close to the M4.\n\nBut Gill and his daughter Kate had \"stepped up\" managing the cattle and sheep and preparing to plant crops while Roger sat alone in hospital.\n\nRoger was still unable to walk or stand up nearly five months after coming home from hospital\n\n\"We could not buckle,\" Gill said, \"because if we buckled he wouldn't have anything to come home to\".\n\nRoger began specialist physiotherapy at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital in June and came home in November.\n\nUnable to walk or even lift himself up, he had to depend on a team of in-home carers and a hoist to get around.\n\nRoger Jones had to have part of his skull removed to get rid of an infection\n\n\"When we had the discharge meetings, it was a case of 'this is as good as it gets',\" Gill said.\n\n\"They said, 'you might improve a bit more but... people with Roger's needs go to a care home'.\"\n\n\"I knew I wasn't going to do that, I was gonna fight. I had to fight it,\" Roger remembered thinking.\n\nDesperate to get back on the farm he had worked for more than 40 years daughter Kate Jones (left) strapped her dad to a golf buggy and drove him around\n\n\"We knew that we wanted to get him home,\" Gill said.\n\nRoger said being at home \"made all the difference\".\n\nHe set a goal of driving a tractor again, something he had not done yet, and when his daughter Jessie got engaged, of being able to walk her down the aisle.\n\n\"It's something you do really,\" he said, \"you want to take them down the aisle\".\n\nHe said the first \"game changer\" was getting a mobility scooter to help around the house.\n\nRoger taking his first steps in April 2022 with physiotherapist Jakko Brouwers\n\nBut when it came to walking, Roger was afraid of falling down and not being able to get up.\n\nJakko Brouwers, a physiotherapist from the Morrello clinic in Newport, started to make home visits to Roger in April 2022. Gill remembers him saying \"this man will walk again\".\n\nBut the first step was telling him to get on the floor, she said.\n\n\"Then he said, 'right, now crawl over to the chair pull yourself up' and he said 'now if you fall over you can get up'.\"\n\nBy February this year, after months at home, he was talking his first steps with a walking stick.\n\nRoger and his daughter Jessie Wheatley practising for their walk down the aisle\n\n\"It's his farming gut determination and strength,\" Gill said, \"that has put him where he is here because if he didn't have that he could have just said 'you know what, this is too much'.'\n\nIn June, his daughter Jessie Wheatley, 37, who was living in Queensland, Australia, came home to prepare for her wedding at a chapel near the farm.\n\nWalking every day with her dad was a big part of the preparations.\n\nDuring these walks, Jessie told her father how surprised she was at the progress he had made in a year.\n\nRoger replied: \"You've got to keep fighting haven't you?\"\n\nRoger achieved his goal of walking his daughter Jessie down the aisle\n\nRoger also got to dance with the new bride", "In February this boat of migrants was rescued some 31 miles (50km) from Tunisia's coast\n\nAt least 29 migrants have died after at least two boats sank off Tunisia's coast within hours of each other, officials say.\n\nThe sub-Saharan migrants were trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Italy.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of migrant boat capsizes off Tunisia's coast in the last few days, with five others sinking in the past four days.\n\nThis comes after Tunisia launched a campaign against undocumented African migrants.\n\nMeanwhile, Italian officials on the island of Lampedusa say they are overwhelmed, after a record 2,500 migrants arrived in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Italian far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, has warned Europe risks seeing a huge wave of refugees arriving on its shores.\n\nTunisia has become a hub for migrants who wish to make it to Europe, with UN figures showing at least 12,000 migrants who landed on Italy's shores this year left from Tunisia. That figure was just 1,300 in the same time period last year.\n\nHowever, the Tunisia coast guard say they are taking steps to stop the migrant crossings, having halted around 80 vessels headed for Europe in the past four days, according to the Reuters news agency. It also says it has detained more than 3,000 migrants, the same agency reports.\n\nIn a controversial speech last month, Tunisia's president accused sub-Saharan African migrants living in the country of causing a crime wave and described them as a demographic threat.\n\nKais Saied's comments were widely criticised by the African Union and denounced as \"racist hate speech\" by human rights groups.\n\nThese comments have left some sub-Saharan Africans in Tunisia living in fear, with some saying they have seen an increase in racist incidents.\n\nThis has led some countries, like Ivory Coast and Guinea, to repatriate their citizens due to an increased climate of intolerance in Tunisia.\n\nTunisia's economy is in a poor state, and is facing crisis after negotiations with the the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stalled.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also warned that Tunisia urgently needs to reach a bailout deal with the IMF.", "Tory MPs are torn about whether or not to back the former prime minister\n\nSome of Boris Johnson's closest allies are rallying behind the former PM before a vote on a damning report which found he had misled MPs over Partygate.\n\nNadine Dorries is among a small group of Johnson loyalists planning to oppose the Privileges Committee's report in a Commons vote on Monday.\n\nMany other Tory MPs have yet to decide how to vote -

who was Mr Johnson's chancellor - has not said whether he will vote on the report.\n\nJohnson loyalists - including former ministers Sir Simon Clarke, Nadine Dorries and Sir Jake Berry - have said they will vote against the report's findings.\n\nIt is likely that many more Conservative MPs could abstain, or simply not turn up to the vote, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all expected to support the committee's findings.\n\nBut Conservative MPs still face a dilemma over Monday's vote.\n\nVoting against the recommendations risks alienating local party activists who want Mr Johnson gone, voting for it risks angering his fans, who believe he has been hounded out of Parliament.\n\nAllies of Mr Johnson warned Tory MPs they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.\n\nSenior Conservative MP Damian Green told the BBC that \"deliberately abstaining is not really rising to the importance of the occasion\".\n\nThe former cabinet minister under Theresa May said he intended to vote to approve the report with a \"heavy heart\".\n\nSir Jake - an ally of Mr Johnson - said he was \"almost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\" of the report on Monday.\n\nBut Sir Jake said he would \"certainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, whose conclusions he called \"wrong\".\n\nSo far, 15 Conservatives have publicly criticised the committee:\n\nLiberal Democrats say the report \"speaks for itself\" and should be approved without a debate.\n\nSir Ed Davey criticised the amount of time the government is spending debating Mr Johnson's conduct, and said the Conservative party is operating \"in absolute chaos\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nFollowing a year-long investigation, the seven-person Privileges Committee found Mr Johnson had had \"personal knowledge\" of Covid-rule breaches in Downing Street but had repeatedly failed to \"pro-actively investigate\" the facts.\n\nThe committee said officials had not advised Mr Johnson that social distancing guidelines were followed at all times, contrary to what he said in the House of Commons at the time.\n\nIn key evidence, Martin Reynolds -

The driver sustained minor injuries, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) said in a statement.\n\nThe crash happened on a tight corner on 29 March, the statement says, with the 53-ft (16m) truck \"rolling onto the passenger side, skidding on its side on the pavement, and then going over a rocky embankment causing it to roll onto its roof\".\n\nWhile thousands of fish made it into the water, many more were left stranded on the bank\n\nOver 25,000 of the salmon smolts - fish that are around two years old - died either inside the truck's tanker or on the creek bank.\n\nThe local sheriff's office responded to the crash, officials said. \"Small amounts of diesel fuel were quickly contained,\" the release said, adding that there was no need for a hazardous material spill response.\n\nThe Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation also responded and helped by collecting and scanning transponders on the dead fish.\n\nSalmon are anadromous, meaning they spend much of their lives in the ocean but return to freshwater rivers to spawn. Many are now raised in government-run hatcheries before being released back into their native waters to later return to those same hatcheries.\n\nODFW officials say the loss represents about 20% of the fish it intended to release into the Imnaha River this year.\n\nThey expect that around 500-900 fewer adult fish will return to spawn in 2026-2027 due to the loss.\n\nThe 77,000 smolts in the Lookingglass Creek will likely lead to around 350-700 additional adults returning there.\n\n\"We are thankful the ODFW employee driving the truck was not seriously injured,\" said ODFW fish hatchery coordinator Andrew Gibbs.\n\n\"This should not impact our ability to collect future brood stock or maintain full production goals in the future.\"", "Former US President Donald Trump made the comments at a speech in Georgia on Saturday\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has called the federal indictment against him \"ridiculous and baseless\" in his first public appearance since the charges were announced.\n\nA 37-count indictment made public on Friday accuses him of keeping sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago property.\n\nAt two campaign speeches on Saturday, Mr Trump said the indictment amounted to \"election interference\" by the \"corrupt\" FBI and justice department.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMr Trump has been charged with mishandling hundreds of classified documents, including some about US nuclear secrets and military plans.\n\nThe indictment accused him of keeping the files at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago including in a ballroom and a shower.\n\nHe lied to investigators and tried to obstruct their investigation into his handling of the documents, the indictment alleged.\n\nIt is the first ever federal criminal prosecution against a former US president.\n\nSpeaking at the first Republican Party convention in Georgia, Mr Trump said: \"They're cheating, they're crooked, they're corrupt - these criminals cannot be rewarded, they must be defeated.\"\n\nHe joked that every time he flies over a \"blue state\" - one controlled by the Democrats - he gets subpoenaed.\n\nMr Trump, who is running for the White House again in 2024, called the indictment a \"hoax\" by the \"corrupt political establishment\", also describing it as a \"joke\" and a \"travesty of justice\".\n\nBoth speeches - in Georgia and later in North Carolina - went on for more than an hour.\n\nHe thanked the \"record crowd\" as well as \"patriots\" who had supported his White House bid, and went on to criticise \"sinister forces\" that were running the country.\n\n\"We're going to stand up to the current political establishment \u2026 and we're going to finish the job we started, the most successful presidency,\" he said, a line that led to chants of \"USA, USA\" breaking out in the crowd.\n\n\"I will never yield, I will never be deterred,\" he said, before turning his attention to the groups he said were plotting against him.\n\nThis included Marxists, communists, \"environmental extremists\", Rinos - Republicans in Name Only - as well as \"open border fanatics\" and \"radical left democrats\".\n\nReferencing the indictment, he claimed the highly-sensitive documents should have fallen under the Presidential Records Act, rather than the Espionage Act.\n\nUnder the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends.

Our revenues last year were \u00a32.3bn - so you're talking about less than 2% of our revenues went to service that debt,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"The vast majority of the debt that our regulated business has comes from bondholders in the open market.\"\n\nMs Ross was chief executive of Ofwat between 2013 and 2017.\n\nShe rejected a suggestion that the regulator's oversight of the water industry was affected by the potential for people to move from working at Ofwat to a potentially lucrative role in the private sector.\n\n\"I don't accept that,\" she told the BBC, adding that when she joined Thames Water she had spent three-and-a-half years working at telecoms company BT.\n\nAsked if it had been her ambition to working in the industry after Ofwat, Ms Ross said: \"I can honestly say the thought had never occurred to me at the time that I worked for Ofwat.

Why do we have to have personal abuse?\"\n\nDuring the rest of his evidence, Sir Chris said one of the key weaknesses the UK faced was the inability to scale up testing quickly.\n\nAnd he described the national lockdown as the \"very big new idea\" of the Covid pandemic and \"very radical thing to do\".\n\n\"It was an extraordinarily major, social intervention with huge economic and social ramifications.\"\n\nSir Chris also defended the government scientific advisory group Sage, which he co-chaired during the pandemic, after suggestions there was not enough diversity of thought within the group.\n\nThere were no economic or social experts for example.\n\nBut Sir Chris said it would have been too \"unwieldly\" if a range of different experts were added to it.\n\nInstead, he said the economic and societal consequences of responding to a pandemic should be done separately through a different mechanism.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic, said it was a \"regret\" that during the pandemic it often took a long period of time for Sage research to be published.\n\n\"I believe that scientific advice should be made public - that's beneficial for everybody,\" he said.\n\nHe added it should always be open to \"scrutiny, comment and challenge\".\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nScott McTominay's late double secured Scotland a comfortable winning start to their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign at home to Cyprus.\n\nJohn McGinn's close-range finish - the Aston Villa midfielder's 16th goal for his country - was reward for a dominant first-half display.\n\nAnd the Manchester United midfielder added his second moments later.\n\nSteve Clarke had billed it as a must-win game against Group A's lowest seeds, who ended the game with 10 men after a late red card for Nicholas Ioannou, and it was job done in that sense.\n\nBut the Scotland head coach will know that, despite their first winning start to a Euro qualifying campaign since 2006, improvement will be needed as top seeds Spain visit on Tuesday.\n\u2022 None Lessons as Scots and Spain start with 3-0 wins\n\u2022 None Reaction and as it happened\n\nThe dawn of new qualifying campaign brought the Tartan Army to Hampden full of optimism.\n\nThey were rewarded with a dominant first-half performance during which they were rarely under threat and probed at the Cypriot defensive wall with consistency and determination.\n\nAll that was lacking was a little more cutting edge in the vital area - directly in front of goal. That was a theme until late on, with the result still uncertain until McTominay stepped up.\n\nScotland's intent was clear. Get at Cyprus down the flanks, particularly the left. That pattern was fairly consistent, but the first real threat came down the other side when Aaron Hickey danced into the box and, from the tightest of angles, forced goalkeeper Demetris Demetriou into a low save at his post.\n\nClarke's side were cruising, comfortable on the ball and showing an impressive level of composure.\n\nThe left flank proved the route to the crucial opening goal as Stuart Armstrong fed Andy Robertson, who timed his run perfectly to stay marginally onside and cross first time. The ball deflected perfectly into McGinn's path as he instinctively raced to meet it and finish from close range to take his Scotland tally to one more than the talismanic James McFadden.\n\nChe Adams came close after super interplay with McGinn, but his shot was tipped over and the unfortunate striker left the field early in the second half with a worrying looking injury.\n\nThe second half show dipped significantly and the creeping doubt began to emerge that Cyprus might just nick something.\n\nFinally, though, Scotland got there - thanks to three of their own substitutes. Ryan Christie did superbly to win possession and fire in a cross ,Lyndon Dykes nodded it on and McTominay raced onto it to half-volley home.\n\nAn enormous cheer and accompanying sigh of relief engulfed Hampden before McTominay capitalised again when Robertson laid the ball into his path and he calmly dispatched it home with ease.\n\nThe 3-0 scoreline adds significant and welcome gloss to the occasion. Clarke will be delighted with that but equally happy to get through this unscathed.\n\nIt became something of a struggle until very late on, but the players stayed calm and avoided a calamity.\n\nThe initial signs were very positive in the first period, with Scotland in complete control.\n\nThey were perhaps a touch cautious in getting into dangerous areas directly in front of goal, but the performance was strong and promised more as the game wore on.\n\nThat said, Cyprus were very well organised and proved sticky opposition.\n\nThe concern will be how standards seemed to slip. There was little composure in the final pass or deliveries from wide areas, but the substitutes made a significant impact to get Scotland over the line.\n\nWhat they said\n\nScotland head coach Steve Clarke: \"We spoke a lot about getting off to a good start and I thought we started the game really well. The movement, the rotation of the players, the creation of space was good. We deserved the lead at that time.\n\n\"I thought up until 30 minutes we were good and I don't know whether we went a bit casual, we switched off a little bit and Cyprus made it difficult for us. Second-half was a slightly difficult game and we slowed the game too much, but it is nice to look at the bench and bring on Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie.\"\n\nCyprus head coach Temuri Ketsbaia: \"I believe we lost to the better team. Scotland deserved to win the game, well done to them. Congratulations.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that we didn't give our best. We tried to change our formation, we tried to put more offensive players. It cost us because we conceded two easy goals.\"\n\nHampden will be rocking now as Spain visit Hampden on Tuesday (19:45 GMT), while Cyprus visit Armenia in a friendly.\n\u2022 None Offside, Cyprus.

Dozens of protesters gathered outside Stradey Park Hotel on Saturday\n\nThe UK government has \"lost control\" of the asylum system, a councillor has claimed.\n\nOn Friday, Carmarthenshire council failed in a High Court bid to stop Stradey Park Hotel, in Llanelli, being used to house up to 241 asylum seekers.\n\nThe Home Office said the plans were necessary and that the asylum system was under \"incredible\" strain.\n\nIt comes as dozens of protesters, for and against the plans, gathered outside the hotel on Saturday.\n\nLocal councillor Martyn Palfreman called on the UK government to \"get a grip\" of the asylum system - saying it had lost it.\n\nFormer racial equality commissioner Aled Edwards also said more work needed to be done in the community to to allay \"irrational fears\" and \"address legitimate ones\".\n\nMaxson Kpakio, 45, is originally from Liberia but has lived in Swansea for 20 years, and came to Wales as an asylum seeker.\n\n\"I am an activist who advocates for social justice and peace. Where I see a group talking about peace and love, I am part of them,\" he said.\n\nMaxson Kpakio said \"asylum seeking is a right for everybody\"\n\nHe was confronted at one point by protesters who oppose the asylum plan.\n\n\"I don't think it was necessary for any confrontation. It was the group from the other side who came to me, and asked me why I'm here, and I told them,\" he said.\n\n\"We had a frank conversation where I tried to educate them as well. Asylum seeking is a right for everybody.\"\n\nResident Helen Thomas, who is against the plans, said a lot of people in the community are scared, partly by how the issue has divided locals.\n\nMs Thomas said some people against the plan have been labelled racist, but said she has friends from many different backgrounds, adding: \"I am not racist, I never have been.\"\n\nDozens of protesters gathered outside Stradey Park Hotel on Saturday\n\n\"My plea would be with the UK government to get a grip on an asylum system, which they have clearly lost the grip of,\" councillor Martyn Palfreman told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\n\"In terms of what happens next and the asylum seekers arrival in Llanelli, the honest answer is I don't know.\"\n\nPolice were called to the hotel on Friday after protesters blocked vehicles entering the site\n\n\"We've been told previously they will be arriving next week, we don't know any more details in terms of the composition of the group that will be arriving or exactly when they will be arriving,\" added Mr Palfreman.\n\nThe Labour councillor for the Hengoed ward of Llanelli added that his \"real concern\" is that the asylum seekers themselves will have anger directed towards them, which he hopes \"doesn't happen\".\n\nLlanelli MP Dame Nia Griffith said she was very disappointed with the outcome of Friday's hearing.\n\n\"I think it's particularly upsetting for the residents who live closely to the hotel and whilst people have a right to their opinion I would actually beg them to be very considerate,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to work together with other countries to find solutions that will last... there has to be a really concerted effort to work internationally with partners so there are proper agreements.\"\n\nFollowing Friday's hearing, council leader Darren Price said he was disappointed and that the authority would consider the judge's reasons on Monday.\n\nThe hotel has faced local opposition since it first announced the plans\n\nAled Edwards, the former commissioner for racial equality in Wales, said a conversation was needed with people in the community to allay \"irrational fears\" and \"address legitimate ones\".\n\n\"If we spend the time explaining to people what people's backgrounds are, what they can offer us, what they can bring us...

Arrows show where she fell from and where she landed\n\nAnwar said they had decided to visit Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano in Holyrood Park, at the bottom of Edinburgh's famous Royal Mile, after dining at the food chain Wagamama's.\n\nThey arrived at the famous hill at about 19:30 and started climbing in order to see the sunset.\n\nBut the pair arrived too late and decided to go back down the hill.\n\nIt was then they decided to take a selfie on a rocky outcrop.\n\nAnwar told police: \"We were below the summit. I lost my balance and fell into her.\n\n\"I heard her go over the edge and say 'oh my foot' and she started screaming. I heard a thud.\"\n\nMs Javed had fallen 50ft (15m) down the cliff.\n\nFawziyah Javed had been married for eight months\n\nBut although she had a visible head injury she was able to speak for a short time while she lay dying on the hillside.\n\nThe first person to reach her, hillwalker Daniyah Rafique, said: \"She told me not to let her husband near her and that he had pushed her.\"\n\nThen police officer, PC Rhiannon Clutton, arrived at the scene. She said: \"She was writhing in pain but she was able to speak to me when I asked her questions.\n\n\"She said she asked the woman what had happened and said her response was: 'He pushed me'.\"\n\nThe police officer added that Ms Javed said her husband had pushed her as she had tried to end the relationship.\n\nShe then went into cardiac arrest and died at the scene from multiple injuries.\n\nLater that night Anwar was arrested for murder.\n\nDet Con Steven Caballero said Anwar asked how many years he would get and said his life was ruined now.\n\nHe asked if he would get bail, but then said \"probably not, not for murder\".\n\nThe detective said the murderer then asked about Edinburgh prisons and what Saughton jail was like.\n\nDuring the trial, Ms Javed was also heard in a phone recording with Anwar calling him \"a disrespectful person\" and said he was \"horrible\".\n\nIn the recording, she asked: \"Which husband treats his wife the way you do?\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

People have not been able to present [during Covid restrictions]. They are presenting much later; they have far more disease and the disease is often more complex to treat.\"\n\nThe BDA says workload backlogs, made worse by Covid, will take many years to clear.\n\nSome dental practices are struggling to deliver their NHS contractual commitments, often simply as a result of being unable to fill vacancies, the association claims.\n\nThe government says it recently announced a 40% increase in dentistry training places and has made changes \"so dental therapists and hygienists can deliver more treatments\".\n\n\"We invest more than \u00a33bn a year in dentistry and have already increased the funding practices receive for high needs patients to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments,\" said a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care.\n\nIt says the NHS dental contract has been reformed to encourage more dentists to provide NHS treatments and to allow dental therapists and hygienists to offer extra services.\n\nThe government also said it would set out further measures \"to improve access shortly\".\n\nLouise Ansari from Healthwatch England said: \"Ultimately, only a fundamental and fully resourced dental contract reform can tackle these deep-seated problems, and we call on the government to publish its dental recovery plan urgently.\"\n\nAre you struggling to find an NHS dentist?

It doesn't impress me at all,\" Sting said.\n\n\"I get immediately bored when I see a computer-generated image. I imagine I will feel the same way about AI making music.\n\n\"Maybe for electronic dance music, it works. But for songs, you know, expressing emotions, I don't think I will be moved by it.\"\n\nSting spoke with the BBC for 30 minutes about a range of subjects including his approach to songwriting\n\nThe recording industry has quickly mobilised against artificial intelligence, launching a group called the \"Human Artistry Campaign\", and warning that AI companies are violating copyright by training their software on commercially-released music.\n\nWhether AI-written music can be copyrighted is still under debate. Under English copyright law, for example, works generated by AI, can theoretically be protected.\n\nHowever, the US Copyright Office recently ruled that AI art, including music, can't be copyrighted as it is \"not the product of human authorship\".\n\nNot everyone is against the technology. Pet Shop Boys frontman Neil Tennant recently suggested AI could help musicians overcome writers' block.\n\n\"There's a song that we wrote a chorus for in 2003 and we never finished because I couldn't think of anything for the verses,\" he told the Radio Times.\n\n\"But now with AI you could give it the bits you've written, press the button and have it fill in the blanks. You might then rewrite it, but it could nonetheless be a tool.\"\n\n\"The tools are useful, but we have to be driving them,\" he said. \"I don't think we can allow the machines to just take over. We have to be wary.\"\n\nThe musician was speaking ahead of the UK's prestigious Ivor Novello songwriting awards on Thursday, where he will be given the organisation's highest honour.\n\nOnly 23 other people have become an Ivor Academy Fellow with British legends Paul McCartney, Kate Bush, Elton John and Annie Lennox among the other honourees.\n\n\"It sounds like something out of the Lord Of The Rings, doesn't it? A Fellowship,\" the star joked. \"But it's very meaningful to me, to win a songwriting prize, because that's what I put on my passport: I'm a songwriter.\"\n\nThe North East-born musician began his career as a member of The Police, before breaking away as a solo artist in 1984.\n\n\"I wanted to start again,\" he said of his decision to break up the band at the height of their fame. \"When you're in a band, it has to have a recognisable sound. So, as a songwriter, I was trapped.\n\n\"There was some risk involved,\" in going solo, he added, \"but I wasn't risking my life or anything. I don't think in music you can have a success without risk.\"\n\nAcross his career, the musician has sold more than 100 million albums, and charted global hits like Message In A Bottle, Every Breath You Take, Fields Of Gold, Englishman In New York and Shape Of My Heart.\n\nBut he said that the first time he made the top 40, with The Police's Roxanne, remained a career highlight.\n\n\"I was in my kitchen, on a plank on top of a ladder, painting the ceiling and I had Radio One on. I suddenly recognised the song and I literally fell off the off the ladder.\n\n\"Nothing will ever beat that first time you hear yourself on the radio. After that, it's just diminishing returns.\"\n\nSting sold his entire back catalogue to UMG last year for a reported nine-figure sum, following in the footsteps of artists like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Shakira and Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks.\n\nHe said he'd handed over control because he trusted his record label and wanted to protect his musical legacy - especially after artists like Prince and Jimi Hendrix had endured messy, posthumous battles over their estate.\n\n\"That can be a mess. So I think it's better to take control of it now.\"\n\nBut the musician added, \"I still think of them as my songs.\"\n\n\"In the same way that a painter who sells his paintings to collectors still thinks of the paintings as being his own, so these are still my songs.\n\n\"I just got paid in advance. It's as simple as that. That's how I rationalise it.\"", "Business group giant the CBI says it has handed over additional information about what it describes as a serious criminal offence to the police.\n\nThe City of London police is already investigating claims a woman was raped at a CBI summer party in 2019.\n\nThe BBC understands that the \"additional information\" relates to a new allegation.\n\nThe CBI has been engulfed in a crisis over a range of allegations including sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\nThe organisation is one of the UK's leading business lobby groups and claims to speak for 190,000 companies.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \"Late yesterday afternoon the CBI was made aware of additional information relating to a report of a serious criminal offence.\n\n\"We have passed that information immediately to the police, with whom we are liaising closely and who have asked us not to comment further on potentially criminal matters\".\n\nThe BBC has contacted the City of London police for comment.\n\nThe CBI also said it was expecting the results of an investigation into the allegations by the law firm Fox Williams \"imminently\".\n\n\"The board will be communicating its response to this and other steps we are taking to bring about the wider change that is needed early next week.\"\n\nThe original allegations emerged after the Guardian reported that more than a dozen woman claimed they had been subject to various forms of sexual misconduct at the CBI.\n\nThe CBI has since suspended three employees while the investigation took place.\n\nSeparately, the lobby group fired its director general Tony Danker in April following complaints of workplace misconduct against him.\n\nMr Danker admitted to the BBC that he had made some staff feel \"very uncomfortable\", adding: \"I apologise for that.\"\n\nHowever, he said that his \"reputation has been totally destroyed\" because his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims including of serious sexual assault that were made at the CBI before he joined.\n\nHe said that his dismissal letter had set out four reasons for firing him and added he was considering legal action against the CBI.\n\nBut Brian McBride, president of the CBI, told the BBC that Mr Danker's description of events was \"selective\" and he was free to seek \"redress\" if he felt unfairly treated.\n\nHe claimed that Mr Danker had been sacked on strong legal grounds.\n\nA former CBI staff member, who was in touch with existing workers at the organisation, said they were \"furious\" and \"upset\" by Mr Danker's interview.\n\n\"It's important that we remember who the victims of this situation are: the women who've had negative experiences with men at the CBI,\" she said.\n\n\"They have described to me feeling furious, grossed out and upset by Danker's attempts to downplay his role in this situation.

Meanwhile, the cost of childcare increased by 44% since 2010, according to analysis from the Trades Union Congress.\n\nThe government announced it will also support eligible parents with their first month of childcare costs when they either enter work or increase their hours, by providing childcare funding upfront. Those parents will receive up to 85% of their childcare costs back before their next month's bills are due.\n\nAnd the Department for Education has also launched a consultation aimed at increasing the early years' workforce in England. A recruitment campaign to attract and retain talent is planned for early next year, which will consider how to introduce new accelerated apprenticeship and degree apprenticeship qualifications.\n\nIn the Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also extended the current scheme offering some families 30 free hours of childcare per week to cover younger children. The changes will be phased in for households in England where the parent or parents earn at least \u00a3152 a week but less than \u00a3100,000 a year.\n\nThe cost of childcare in the UK is among the most expensive in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For a couple with two young children childcare costs take up nearly 30% of their income, according to the OECD.\n\nThe average annual price for full-time nursery childcare in England for a child under-two was more than \u00a314,000 in 2022, according to children's charity Coram.\n\nA survey of 24,000 parents, which was published in March by campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, found 76% of mothers who pay for childcare feel it no longer makes financial sense for them to work.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said the changes will \"cut inactivity and help grow the economy\".\n\nMr Stride said: \"These changes will help thousands of parents progress their career without compromising the quality of the care that their children receive.\n\n\"By helping more parents to re-enter and progress in work, we will be able to cut inactivity and help grow the economy.\"\n\nShadow education minister Helen Hayes said: \"The Conservatives are piling pressure on a broken system.\n\n\"Their plans come with no plan to increase the workforce, who are so critical to delivering an expansion of childcare.\n\n\"What parents and children both need is higher standards, better availability across our country, and a flexible system that supports families from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school.\"", "People who work with children in England will be legally required to report child sexual abuse or face prosecution under government plans.\n\nThe move - which is subject to a consultation - was recommended last year by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA).\n\nThe home secretary told the BBC she wanted to correct one of the \"biggest national scandals\".\n\nSuella Braverman is expected to set out more details in the coming days.\n\nIn its final report last October, the IICSA called the scale of abuse in England and Wales \"horrific and deeply disturbing\".\n\nAround 7,000 victims of abuse provided testimonies to the seven-year inquiry, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\n\nIt recommended prosecutions for anyone working with children who failed to report indications of sexual abuse.\n\nThe government is also promising more support for local police forces to tackle grooming gangs, with a new taskforce of specialist officers to help them with investigations into child sexual exploitation.\n\nDowning Street said improved data on the ethnicity of perpetrators would also be used to help ensure \"suspects cannot evade justice because of cultural sensitivities\".\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, who will launch the taskforce on Monday alongside other measures to tackle child sexual abuse, said: \"For too long, political correctness has stopped us from weeding out vile criminals who prey on children and young women. We will stop at nothing to stamp out these dangerous gangs.\"\n\nMs Braverman said while the fault lay with the perpetrators for \"carrying out heinous and vile acts of depravity\", there was also \"a wilful turning of the blind eye\" among authorities.\n\n\"Silence has enabled this abuse - we need to ensure a duty on those professionals that they can't get away with inaction,\" she told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\nShe said that in towns around the country, \"vulnerable white girls living in troubled circumstances have been abused, drugged, raped, and exploited\" by networks of gangs of rapists, which she claimed were \"overwhelmingly\" made up of British-Pakistani males.\n\nMs Braverman added that \"cultural sensitivities\" and concerns about \"being called bigoted\" had played a role in high-profile abuse scandals including in Rochdale and Rotherham.\n\nAn independent inquiry found at least 1,400 children had been subjected to sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, with the perpetrators predominantly men of Pakistani heritage.\n\nLater, Home Office-commissioned research found that, more generally, there was not enough evidence to suggest members of grooming gangs were more likely to be Asian or black than other ethnicities.\n\nThe Labour Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, called Ms Braverman's comments a \"dog whistle\" - meaning a coded message designed to appeal to a certain group.\n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused the government of \"hopelessly inadequate, belated and narrow\" efforts to tackle grooming, and of trying to get \"short-term headlines\".\n\nMinisters had known about the role of gangs in child exploitation for years, she said, but had \"failed to act\" until now on a longstanding Labour recommendation to make reporting abuse mandatory.\n\nShe added: \"Only 11% of child sexual abuse cases ends with a charge - down from 32% seven years ago.\"\n\nIn an earlier article written for the Mail on Sunday, Ms Braverman said she was committing to introducing mandatory reporting across the whole of England.\n\nThe \"overwhelming majority\" of safeguarding professionals, such as teachers and social workers, saw it as their \"duty\" to report abuse, she wrote, but she said she now had to take a tougher approach.\n\nThe NSPCC said the plan to legally compel people to report abuse was a \"step in the right direction\", but that more work was needed in order to improve the understanding of who was at risk.\n\nIt also said there needed to be an \"overhaul\" of support for those already suffering the consequences of abuse.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael welcomed the move, but said the government needed to do more.\n\nHe said: \"Unless the government tackles the backlog in our courts and restores community policing, too many criminals will continue to evade justice.\"\n\u2022 None Not reporting child abuse must be crime \u2013 inquiry", "Sir Elton John says he has planned an entirely new show for his headline performance at Glastonbury this Sunday.\n\nThe star is playing the festival as the final UK date of his farewell tour, but said fans should expect the unexpected.\n\n\"I'm starting with a song I haven't played for about 10 years, so we'll see how it goes,\" he told BBC Radio 1.\n\n\"I've got the set list down, I've got rehearsal dates booked for the guest artists, so we just have to hope the weather will still be nice.\"\n\nSunday night's set will come more than five years after Sir Elton announced his 350-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.\n\nIt was originally due to end in 2021, giving the 76-year-old more time to spend with his young family, but multiple dates had to be rescheduled due to the Covid pandemic and a hip injury the singer sustained last year.\n\nThe Glastonbury date wraps up his touring commitments in the UK, and Sir Elton told Radio 1's Clara Amfo it \"couldn't be a more perfect ending\".\n\nHe added that the set list had been revamped to keep the show fresh.\n\n\"It's a different show to what people have been seeing. On Farewell Yellow Brick Road, there's quite a lot of deep cuts, it's not all hits, and you've got to keep people interested.\n\n\"When you put a setlist together, I always say it's a bit like having sex.

Those concerts were suitably grand affairs that saw guest appearances by Dua Lipa, Kiki Dee and Brandi Carlile.\n\nThe star has confirmed he will have special guests when he visits Worthy Farm, but is keeping their identities under wraps.\n\nIt will be his first ever performance at the festival and, he confessed, his first visit to Glastonbury, full stop.\n\n\"I've watched Glastonbury on the TV,\" he said, \"and the thing that I love about Glastonbury is not the headliners, per se, it's the people on the smaller stages that they give the chance to shine.\n\n\"So if I was at Glastonbury, I would probably be in one of the smaller tents, looking at one of the newer acts playing, because that's what I want to see.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Intergovernmental Conference\n\nThe British and Irish governments have clashed over the UK's controversial bill dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt happened during a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London (BIIGC) on Monday.\n\nIt is understood Irish delegation raised concerns over the impact on investigations into loyalists attacks in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe BIIGC was set up by the Good Friday Agreement and meets twice a year.\n\nThe UK government's legislation on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland offers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings and other Troubles-related crimes.\n\nIt has been criticised by victims' groups, the Irish government and political parties at Stormont.\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin said both governments need to work together on the issue of legacy\n\nOn Monday, it is understood the UK government was challenged on how its plan to end all police investigations as part of its legacy bill will affect ongoing Garda (Irish police) investigations into loyalist attacks.\n\nIrish government representatives highlighted both the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 when 33 people were killed and also the loyalist bomb attacks in Belturbet, County Cavan, in 1972 when two teenagers were fatally injured.\n\nLast year Garda\u00ed released two photofit images of a suspect in the Belturbet attacks as part of its cross-border investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said both governments needed to work together on the issue of legacy.\n\nHe said he had an issue with people being granted immunity.\n\n\"We have fundamental concerns about the legislation currently before parliament,\" Mr Martin told the BIIGC press conference.\n\n\"We don't believe it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights,\" he added.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris said there was a \"complete agreement\" on the need for a restored executive\n\nMeanwhile, the Stormont stalemate was top of the agenda at the meeting for Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nHe said both governments were in \"complete agreement\" on the need for the restoration of the Northern Ireland executive.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the local election results highlighted that the people of Northern Ireland wanted restoration as well.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in emerged as the biggest party in both local government and the Stormont assembly following recent elections.\n\nLast week, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government was well aware of his party's concerns on the protocol which needed to be addressed before a return to Stormont.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill called on the DUP to clarify what it has asked the government for in relation to the working of the NI Protocol.\n\nMs O'Neill said it was \"unacceptable\" that the DUP seemed to be holding private discussions with the government.\n\nAsked about Monday night's Commons debate on the privileges committee report that found former PM Boris Johnson misled parliament, Ms O'Neill said she would not comment on how MPs should vote but said \"Boris Johnson has been a disaster from start to finish\".\n\nMPs later voted by a margin of 354 to seven to approve the report.\n\nThe BIIGC is one of the few such bodies unaffected by the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycott of Stormont.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris's number two, Steve Baker, and Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee were also at the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was held as talks continued between the UK government and the DUP.\n\nIt is understood the party is looking for changes to the legislation governing the Northern Ireland Protocol as well as further constitutional guarantees.\n\nLast week Mr Heaton-Harris caused raised eyebrows when he said he did not know what the DUP was asking for - a view contradicted by the party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\n\nOn Friday, at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Jersey, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he was sure Mr Heaton-Harris would \"listen respectfully\" to the DUP's position.\n\nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government could only play a supporting role.", "It will be compulsory for all post-primary schools in Northern Ireland to teach pupils about access to abortion and prevention of early pregnancy.\n\nIt comes after Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris laid new regulations in Parliament, covering relationships and sex education (RSE).\n\nIn a written statement, he said he had a legal duty to act on recommendations made in a United Nations (UN) report.\n\nUntil now individuals schools have decided how to teach sex education.\n\nBut the Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, or the CEDAW Report, it said RSE in Northern Ireland should be compulsory and comprehensive.\n\nIn practice that will mean pupils have to be taught about issues like how to prevent a pregnancy, the legal right to an abortion in Northern Ireland, and how relevant services may be accessed.\n\nIn a statement, Stormont's Department of Education said: \"The department will now consider the implications of the new duties placed on it, including assessing any additional resources that will be required.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Heaton-Harris said: \"I have today laid regulations in Parliament to implement the CEDAW recommendation to 'make age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on sexual and reproductive health and rights, a compulsory component of curriculum for adolescents, covering prevention of early pregnancy and access to abortion in Northern Ireland, and monitor its implementation.'\"\n\n\"The regulations will mirror the approach taken in England with regard to education about the prevention of early pregnancy and access to abortion.\n\n\"It has always been my preference that, as a devolved matter, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland updates the curriculum.\n\n\"However, nearly four years have passed since the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2019, adolescents in Northern Ireland are still not receiving comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on sexual and reproductive health and rights.\"\n\nEach school in Northern Ireland is currently required by the department to develop its own RSE policy and to teach RSE.\n\nHowever what is actually taught to pupils about RSE has been a matter for each school to decide, based on their school ethos.\n\nThat approach has previously been criticised by some experts, who have said it leads to \"different and inconsistent learning experiences\" for pupils.\n\nThe Executive Formation Act previously led to new laws on abortion being introduced in Northern Ireland.\n\nBut according to Mr Heaton-Harris, that act also required him to implement recommendations on RSE contained in the CEDAW report.\n\nThe CEDAW report said that young people were \"denied the education necessary to enjoy their sexual and reproductive health and rights\".\n\nIn his written statement on Tuesday, Mr Heaton-Harris said he was amending previous education acts in Northern Ireland to make aspects of RSE compulsory.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris says he is amending previous education acts in Northern Ireland to make aspects of sex education compulsory\n\nAlthough the changes to the RSE curriculum will come into effect from 1 July, the Department of Education must issue guidance to schools by 1 January 2024 on what they are required to teach.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said that would give six months for \"meaningful engagement with teachers, parents and young people\" about the changes.\n\nHe also said that parents could still withdraw their children \"from education on sexual and reproductive health and rights, or elements of that education\".\n\n\"This follows the approach taken in England and Scotland,\" he said.\n\n\"Consultation with parents on relationship and sexuality education is already common practice in Northern Ireland and we expect the Department of Education to ensure schools afford parents the opportunity to review relevant materials.\n\n\"Educating adolescents on issues such as contraception, and access to abortion in Northern Ireland, should be done in a factual way that does not advocate, or oppose, a particular view on the moral and ethical considerations of abortion or contraception.\"\n\nThe changes to RSE have been welcomed by the NSPCC in Northern Ireland.\n\nNatalie Whelehan from the children's charity called the new regulations a \"positive step\".\n\n\"Making excellent quality RSE teaching available to all secondary school-aged children will ensure they receive information on what constitutes healthy and unhealthy relationships both online and offline and about their right to be safe, heard and protected,\" she said.\n\n\"This positive step also means that young people in Northern Ireland will now have consistent access to similar information available to young people in the rest of the UK.\"\n\nThe moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr John Kirkpatrick, said the Northern Ireland Secretary was trying to \"impose a particular worldview on the education of children in Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"In an increasingly pluralistic context, RSE of course should be taught in a sensitive and inclusive manner, where teaching is reinforced and supported by policies and processes that schools have in place around safeguarding, bullying and pastoral care,\" he said.\n\n\"Young people should have the opportunity to explore their own personal morals, values and beliefs including the moral and ethical considerations around sensitive issues like abortion and contraception.\n\n\"The secretary of state's actions run contrary to these aspirations,\" he continued.", "The UK will send hundreds of air defence missiles and armed drones to Ukraine on top of the Storm Shadow cruise missiles announced last week.\n\nThe move means the UK is going further than any other country in providing weapons with the potential to tip the battlefield in Ukraine's favour.\n\nEarlier, President Volodymyr Zelensky met the UK's Rishi Sunak as part of his tour of Western allies.\n\nMr Zelensky said it was important for the West to send fighter jets as well.\n\nBut the prime minister said providing fighter jets was \"not a straightforward thing\", although he did say the UK would form \"a key part of the coalition countries\" providing that support.\n\nUkraine is continuing to prepare for a much-anticipated counter-offensive against Russian forces.\n\nLast week, Mr Zelensky told the BBC his country needed more weaponry before it could launch the attack.\n\nOn Monday, the Ukrainian president had about two hours of talks with Mr Sunak at Chequers, near London.\n\nHe arrived on British soil for a surprise visit after a whirlwind tour of Western Europe that also took in Rome, Berlin and Paris.\n\nMr Zelensky said Ukraine and the UK were \"real partners\", while Mr Sunak's spokesman described the meeting as \"warm and collegiate\".\n\nThe Storm Shadow cruise missiles can be used to destroy Russia's positions on occupied Ukrainian territory.\n\nIf Ukraine can destroy Russia's command centres, logistics hubs and ammunition depots in occupied territory, then it may prove impossible for Moscow to continue resupplying its frontline troops in places.\n\nThis is what Ukraine did so successfully in Kherson last year, forcing the Russians to withdraw almost without a fight. It will now be hoping to repeat the process with the help of Western-supplied munitions.\n\nPresident Zelensky's repeated calls for Nato to send F-16 jets are being met with delays and obfuscations, for several reasons.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force has trained its pilots on F-16s, which the RAF do not use, but such training takes months, not days.\n\nLogistics, maintenance and the need to find suitable runways are all important too.\n\nFinally, there is the question of escalation.

Watch: We can make a big difference to childcare costs, says Jeremy Hunt\n\nThe chancellor has vowed to help reduce the cost of childcare at Wednesday's Budget as part of a wider drive to help people into work.\n\nJeremy Hunt told the BBC that costs were stopping some parents taking a job, and the government could make a \"big difference\" to reduce them.\n\nHe said further support would be part of a package of measures to break down \"barriers\" to entering the workforce.\n\nBut he said public finances meant the room for tax cuts was limited.\n\nMinisters have a lot of heavy lifting to do to make a big impression at the Budget, against the backdrop of an economy that is still wobbly.\n\nConservative backbench MPs are calling for tax cuts they are not going to get, whilst Labour is slamming the government's long-term record.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says her party's plan to secure more investment in green industries could arrest a \"low growth spiral\" in the UK.\n\nUnder Budget plans that have already been announced, the government is expected to pay childcare support to parents on universal credit up front instead in arrears, as now.\n\nThe current UK-wide \u00a3646-a-month per child cap on support for universal credit claimants is also expected to be increased by several hundred pounds. An exact figure has not yet been given.\n\nIt is expected to be part of a package of measures designed to reverse a rise in economic inactivity since Covid, including changes to fitness-to-work tests for those with medical conditions.\n\nThe Budget is also expected to extend the current level of support for energy bills, limiting costs for a typical family to \u00a32,500 a year, for a further three months until June.\n\nOther measures reportedly under consideration, but not yet confirmed, include continuing the 5p cut to fuel duty, changes to tax-free pensions allowances, and bringing forward a rise in the pension age.\n\nMr Hunt has also resisted Tory calls for the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% to be cancelled or deferred.\n\nDownplaying the prospects of a major tax-cutting Budget, Mr Hunt said it was important to be \"responsible with [the] public finances\".\n\nAdding that any cuts would have to be \"within the bounds of what is responsible,\" he said \"Conservatives cut taxes when they can\".\n\nHe also signalled that he was unlikely to announce further childcare support for families that don't qualify for Universal Credit, describing this as \"expensive\".\n\nAlthough ministers \"would like to help everyone,\" he added that \"you can't always do everything at once\".\n\nCutting childcare costs has emerged as a key political battleground, with prices in the UK among the highest in the world.\n\nCritics say the current level of government support means it is simply not worth large numbers of parents, even those on middle incomes, taking on new or extra work.\n\nEarly Years Alliance, an education charity, has welcomed the changes for families on benefits, but urged a \"wider package of measures\" to bring down costs for parents.\n\nLabour has promised to completely overhaul the system in England if it takes office, saying the current model of free childcare hours is \"broken\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

His motives are unknown.\n\nThe suspect, named only as Philipp F, is said to have had \"ill feelings\" towards the religious community, of which he had previously been a member.\n\nVideo has emerged appearing to show him firing through a window of the hall.\n\nAt a briefing on Friday, the police said four men and two women were shot dead. All the dead were German nationals.\n\nEight people were injured, four seriously. A Ugandan and a Ukrainian were among those hurt.\n\nA woman who was seven months pregnant was shot - killing her unborn baby. The mother survived.\n\nThe first emergency call came at 21:04 local time (20:04 GMT) on Thursday, to report that shots had been fired in the building on Deelb\u00f6ge street, Gross Borstel district, the police said.\n\nOfficers were on site four minutes later, and they were almost immediately joined by special forces. The officers had to break windows to enter the building where about 50 people had gathered.\n\nThe suspect - described as 35-year-old \"sports shooter\" who had a gun licence - had fled to the first floor. His \"lifeless body\" was found shortly afterwards.\n\nHe had managed to shoot nine magazines of ammunition, and 20 more were found in his backpack.\n\nGerman Senator Andy Grote said \"fast and decisive actions\" by police officers had saved many lives. He also described the attack as the \"worst crime\" in Hamburg's recent history.\n\nPolice confirmed that they had previously received an anonymous tip-off that raised concerns about the perpetrator's mental health. Officers had visited him after the tip-off - but did not have enough grounds to take away his gun at the time.\n\nGregor Miesbach, who filmed the gunman shooting through a first-floor window, told the Bild newspaper: \"I didn't realise what was happening. I was filming with my phone, and only realised through the zoom that someone was shooting at Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n\"I heard loud gunshots... I saw a man with a firearm shooting through a window and filmed it,\" he said.\n\nLara Bauch, a 23-year-old student who lives nearby, told the DPA news agency that \"there were about four bursts of gunfire - several shots were fired in each burst - with gaps lasting roughly 20 seconds to a minute\".\n\nShe said that from her window she could see a person frantically running from the ground floor to the first floor. \"The man was wearing dark clothing and moving fast,\" she added.\n\nAn alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, on Thursday evening telling locals that \"one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church\".\n\nLocal residents were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation.\n\nFootage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances.\n\nForensic experts worked at the scene through the night\n\nThe reasons behind the shooting were \"still completely unclear\".\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz described it as a \"brutal act of violence\", saying his thoughts were with the victims and their relatives.\n\nIn a statement, the Jehovah's Witness community in Germany said it was \"deeply saddened by the horrific attack on its members at the Kingdom Hall in Hamburg after a religious service\".\n\nForensic experts in white suits worked through the night inside the brightly lit interior of the meeting house.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nIn its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany.\n\nIn the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members of the organisation.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses are probably best known for their door-to-door evangelism; witnessing from house to house and offering Bible literature.\n\nAlthough Christian-based, the group believes that the traditional Christian Churches have deviated from the true teachings of the Bible, and do not work in full harmony with God.\n\nGermany has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence.\n\nIn 2021, there were around one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry.

There are now three cars in the area. Experts believe the model reduces the amount of time police spend on such cases.\n\nPolice officers are believed to spend 20-40% of their time dealing with mental health calls and incidents\n\n\"It can help prevent hospital admission, get [patients] more access to more appropriate support and in a more timely fashion,\" says Owen Winsland, a mental health nurse on the team. \"And for the police, it reduces the amount of officer time that is spent dealing with health and social care issues.\"\n\n\"Certainly in my time, 17 years, we've never had any standardised formal mental health training,\" Sgt Paul Shelley told Newsnight. \"We do have inputs from health around - in particular - diagnosis and how to deal with people in a particular way.\"\n\nThe College of Policing defines a mental health incident as \"any police incident thought to relate to someone's mental health where their vulnerability is at the centre of the incident\". And police officers are estimated to spend 20-40% of their time dealing with such incidents.\n\nSome police chiefs believe the rise is down to police increasingly being seen as the first resort for people in a crisis, as well as a lack of capacity in the community to deal with growing mental health demands.\n\nIn November last year, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police said for every mental health patient his officers deal with, they spent an average of 14 hours in A&E. Sir Mark Rowley said officers were doing health and social care work that was \"not police work\".\n\nThe Home Office said the new approach it is developing \"will make it easier for staff in police control rooms to identify the right agency to deploy at the outset when responding to 999 calls concerning individuals experiencing a mental health crisis\".\n\nThe government says \u00a3150m capital investment announced last month will improve the places and spaces across the NHS for people experiencing - or at risk of experiencing - mental health crises to receive care and support in more appropriate settings outside of A&E.\n\nIt says the funding will allow for the procurement of up to 90 new mental health ambulances, which will take specialist staff directly to patients to deliver support on scene or transfer them to the most appropriate place for care.", "Part of the graveyard in Lewes Road has been cordoned off by police\n\nA man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the bodies of a man and a woman were found at an address in East Sussex.\n\nThe 33-year-old man and 30-year-old woman were discovered in a property in Lewes Road, Newhaven, just after 19:00 BST on Friday.\n\nA 64-year-old man from Brighton is in custody.\n\nPolice said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.\n\nPart of the graveyard on Lewes Road has been cordoned off, which is next to the house at the centre of the investigation.\n\nThe house at the centre of the investigation is next door to a graveyard\n\nDet Ch Insp Kimball Edey said: \"We are in the early stages of this fast-moving investigation, following a tragic incident in which two people have sadly lost their lives.\n\n\"I understand this will be alarming to the community and there will be an increased police presence in the area for some time.\n\n\"I would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding while we establish the full circumstances.\"\n\nPolice said the two victims were discovered in a property in Lewes Road\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

On average, those over 65 have at least two.\n\nAnd the situation is only going to worsen. \"The numbers are going to grow,\" Health Foundation director of research and economics Anita Charlesworth says. \"The baby boomer generation is reaching old age.\n\n\"Their health is going to be shaped by the lives they have lived - and they are a generation that have lived through the rapid increase in obesity. Their ill health is baked in. The next two decades are going to be very challenging.\"\n\nIncreases in the NHS budget will be needed but this must be accompanied by a shift in how resources are distributed, she says, so more is spent \"upstream\" in the community, including on social care, which sits outside the NHS, and prevention, to help people better manage their conditions without hospital care.\n\nBut given the amount of public money spent on the NHS has been rising ever since the health service was created - it now accounts for more than 40p out of every \u00a31 spent on day-to-day public services, once things such as welfare are excluded - many are asking whether such spending is sustainable.\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who has floated the idea of charging to see a GP, arguing the NHS should be willing to learn from the approaches adopted by other countries, has called the current direction of travel \"unsustainable\".\n\nBut Ms Charlesworth, who used to be director of public spending at the Treasury, says extra money can be found, pointing out countries around the world are having to do the same.\n\n\"This is not unique to the the UK and our system,\" she says. \"It is a global phenomenon. But increasing investment in the NHS is going to require economic growth - without that, you have to cut other services or increase taxation.\"\n\nHealthcare spending should be seen as an investment in the country, rather than a cost, Ms Charlesworth says, pointing to data showing 2.5 million people are out of work because of poor health - equating to one person off long-term sick for every 13 in work.\n\n\"Economic growth depends on good health,\" she says, \"but at the moment, we have got too many people on waiting lists - and there is a particular problem with mental health too.\"\n\nKing's Fund chief policy analyst Siva Anandaciva, who recently produced a report for the think tank looking at how the NHS compared with other rich nations, says as much as 5-6% extra a year may be needed in the short-term to tackle the immediate problems with the backlog and ageing infrastructure - the boost to the workforce announced by the government last week will take years to have an impact.\n\nHis report showed how the NHS had fewer staff and less equipment such as scanners than many other comparable countries - and to those who suggest a different model of funding may be needed, made it clear the findings were not an argument for moving to another system, adding there was little evidence any one particular approach was inherently better than another.\n\n\"History tells us that we do need to spend more on the NHS,\" Mr Anandaciva says. \"Anything less than 2% is managed decline - and what we are spending now 3-4% is just standing still.\"\n\nHe says that will likely mean investing a greater proportion of public spending on the NHS, but says digital technology can make savings in other spending areas whereas the NHS is heavily reliant on labour. \"At some point you will need a nurse to provide care,\" he adds.\n\nLife expectancy gains since the NHS' creation have not been matched by increases in healthy life expectancy - on average, people are now expected to spend more than 20 years living in ill-health, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\"We had hoped that medical advances would lead to people both living longer and living longer in good health - but that has not happened,\" Mr Anandaciva says. \"It will require us to become much more active and healthier.\"\n\nMany of the factors that influence the way people live are outside the NHS' control, he says. These so-called social determinants include education, work, housing and neighbourhoods.\n\nMr Anandaciva would like to see employers in particular more involved in the health of their workforce and backs the use of \"sin taxes\" such as minimum pricing for alcohol and levies on sugar and salt to influence behaviour.\n\nBut he says there will also need to be an honest debate on where to prioritise that spending. \"At the end of life, our use of healthcare gets more intense and costs more,\" Mr Anandaciva says. \"Would money be better used elsewhere?\"\n\nIt is a point also made by Prof Sir David Haslam, who used to chair the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, which decides what treatments should be made available on the NHS.\n\nSir David, who has written a book, Side Effects, about the challenges facing the NHS, says there needs to be more focus on getting \"most bang for our buck\".\n\nThere is too much focus on drugs and treatment that simply extend life rather than services that support people to live in good health, he says.\n\n\"For example, research has shown seeing the same GP for years reduces hospital admissions significantly,\" Sir David says. \"If that was a drug, we would hail it as a wonder treatment - but instead, we've watched the number of GPs fall.\"\n\nHe says the medical profession overall is too \"super-specialised\" and calls for more generalists in the community and hospital to treat \"the individual rather than their organs\".\n\n\"It's so wasteful - patients with six or seven conditions can spend all their time going to different hospital departments, seeing different people, often with poor co-ordination between them,\" Sir David says.\n\nAnd he also questions the amount of medical intervention at the end of life.\n\n\"Too many frail elderly patients are dying in hospital when that may be a completely inappropriate place,\" Sir David says.\n\n\"We have over-medicalised the end of life. When I die, I want to be in the place that is my home, with good care being provided. This is not about rationing care, it is about providing rational care.\"", "As branch secretary of the NUM, Tyrone O'Sullivan led the buyout of Tower Colliery, extending its life by 13 years\n\nTributes have been paid to a \"legendary\" Welsh miners' leader following his death at the age of 77.\n\nTyrone O'Sullivan led the miners' buyout of Tower Colliery in Rhondda Cynon Taf, the last deep pit in Wales.\n\nWorkers used their redundancy money and marched back to work in 1995, a year after the mine near Hirwaun had closed.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford called him \"a giant, in every sense, of the Labour movement and a great figure in the history of Wales in our own time\".\n\nDuring the miners' strike of 1984-85, he was a flying picket, quickly mobilising busloads of miners to join the picket line at various collieries.\n\n\"We had to fight the fight,\" he said in a BBC Wales interview in January.\n\nTyrone O'Sullivan at a rally in Merthyr Tydfil in 2016 before an appearance by then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\n\n\"It's a wonderful feeling, and strikes give you that feeling.

but that the \"alarming drop in members shows that the party needs a change in direction\".\n\nMs Regan issued a statement that said only: \"I get things done\", with her campaign questioning on Twitter whether the big drop in membership - which it linked to the government's controversial gender reforms - was a reason for Ms Sturgeon's resignation.\n\nShe later told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that it had been several weeks since she first asked for the membership figures to be released, but that she was pleased it had been as \"we want to show that the SNP is fair, transparent and accountable\".\n\nMs Regan also repeated her call for an independent observer to be appointed to oversee the leadership election.\n\nThe SNP's national secretary, Lorna Finn, wrote to the candidates earlier on Thursday in an attempt to address their concerns about transparency.\n\nA spokesperson for the party said: \"All three candidates were successful in parliamentary selection contests using exactly the same voting system and independent ballot services firm.\n\n\"The national secretary has again confirmed all necessary safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of the ballot.\"\n\nThe third candidate in the contest, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, said his two rivals had produced no tangible evidence that would throw the integrity of the election process into question.\n\nBut he added that it had been \"a bit of an own goal\" for the party not to have published the figure at the start of the process, adding: \"I don't know why they didn't -

Ms Sturgeon's husband - in the leadership contest, saying it was a \"clear conflict of interest\".\n\nHer campaign had also said it had concerns about votes from deceased party members or those who have allowed their membership to expire.\n\nAn open letter sent on behalf of Ms Regan and Ms Forbes to Mr Murrell had called on him to clarify how many \"paid-up\" members the party has, and the number of digital and postal voting papers that have been released.\n\nMs Regan and Ms Forbes had urged Peter Murrell to clarify how many members the party currently has\n\nMs Sturgeon denied her party was in crisis and said she had \"100% confidence\" in the process as she left her penultimate First Minister's Questions on Thursday.\n\nShe added: \"My party is having a democratic leadership election - growing pains for any organisation can be painful, but they are important.\n\n\"I think it's incumbent for the three candidates standing to succeed me that they remember the task is to retain the trust of the Scottish people that we have won consistently over, not just the eight years of my leadership, but consistently since 2007.\"\n\nSNP president Mike Russell told BBC Scotland the highest standards were being observed but accepted that the membership figures should have been published earlier.\n\n\"The party has to unite after this,\" he said. \"We have an important job to do for Scotland and I'm quite sure the three candidates are capable of that.\"\n\nScottish Conservatives chairman Craig Hoy said the SNP \"had to be dragged kicking and screaming into even releasing these numbers\".\n\nHe added: \"The SNP government are out-of-touch with the real priorities of Scotland and it seems tens of thousands of now former members have also come to that conclusion and decided enough is enough.\"\n\nThe leadership ballot is being managed by Southampton-based polling firm Mi-Voice, which the SNP has used for internal contests since 2013.

The government said the union should put an existing offer to RMT members.\n\nThe strikes came as travellers faced long waits at times at the Port of Dover, where there were delays of up to two-and-a-half hours on Saturday.\n\nBy the evening almost 30,000 people had made their way through the port, en route to France, with queues peaking before lunchtime. However by the early evening the queues had been resolved.\n\nAt 18:00, officials said traffic was \"free-flowing in the port\" with no delays.\n\nNatalie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, described the day as \"challenging\" for port traffic, and said delays had been hampered by the fact many travellers changed their plans at short notice \"due to \"the continental heatwave.\n\nSeparately the train strike affected passengers at at London's Euston railway station, where some travellers told the BBC they had some sympathy for rail workers, as others spoke of their frustration as they tried to make alternative plans.\n\nThe operators affected are based in England, but some run services into Wales and Scotland. They include:\n\nElsewhere, motorway traffic was temporarily blocked after a herd of cows wandered onto the M6 near Stoke on Trent.\n\nNational Highways said traffic had begun flowing again, but with 45-minute delays both ways, after the herd moved away.\n\nIt said it was monitoring the cows' whereabouts and that Staffordshire Police was \"working to advise the farmer to ensure the cows are secured\".\n\nKate Nicholls, from the trade body UK Hospitality, said trade \"falls off a cliff\" in towns and city centres across the UK every day there is a rail strike.\n\nShe estimated that around \u00a3340m worth of sales in the UK had been lost over the past week during three strike days and a drivers' overtime ban.\n\nSaturday's action is the last strike in the diary and unions have to give at least 14 days' notice of any further strike action.\n\nHowever, next week Aslef, the train drivers' union, has an overtime ban scheduled, which will also affect services.\n\nAsked when the industrial action was going to end, the RMT's general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"We don't know. We've got a government who won't negotiate.\"\n\nHe told BBC's Breakfast show that workers had not had a pay rise for four years, but that the more pressing issue was job cuts.\n\n\"They've given me statutory notices for 2,300 of our members leaving the industry. They are then going to move on to catering and engineering and other workers in the industry so the immediate thing is job security,\" he said.\n\n\"When we've concluded those things, we would like a pay rise that addresses the cost of living crisis,\" he said, but declined to put a figure on it. \"There are a lot of issues to deal with but they can be resolved fairly sensibly if they come to the table with good will.\"\n\nJosh Coe, from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the 14 affected train companies, said: \"We've been negotiating with the leaders of the RMT now for over a year and it's a real shame that the offer we made to them worth 13% in terms of an increase in pay for the lowest paid is not being put to their membership which would have brought this industrial dispute to an end.\"\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"The government has met the rail unions, listened to them and facilitated improved offers on pay and reform.\n\n\"The union leaders should put these fair and reasonable offers to their members so this dispute can be resolved.\"\n\nThe RMT's senior assistant general secretary Eddie Dempsey said this morning that the union had already held a \"mass consultation\" with its members on the offer, \"and they gave us their view which was that they wanted to reject the offer and see an improvement\".\n\nThe union was therefore \"not going to put an offer to our members that we've already rejected\", he said.\n\nIf nothing changes, the RMT could schedule more strikes until November, when it would have to re-ballot members.\n\nThe average salary of rail workers in 2022 was \u00a345,919, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nExcluding drivers - who tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT - its estimate is \u00a339,518.\n\nHowever, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it did not include rail cleaning staff.\n\nHow will the rail strikes affect your journey?

both ministerial and official.\n\nHe will now appoint new lawyers to represent him at the inquiry, which will be funded by the taxpayer.\n\nThe Cabinet Office said officials had been obliged to disclose the documents under civil service rules.\n\nThe Times, which first reported the story, says Mr Johnson has been referred to Thames Valley police because his ministerial diary revealed visits by family and friends to Chequers -

distressing for those who lost relatives, no doubt, and deeply embarrassing for those who pressed send.\n\nThere has also been more evidence of how No 10 struggled to get its story straight as the public reeled from revelations that there was booze and get-togethers in Downing Street during lockdown.\n\nAnd there have been fresh conversations in the Conservative Party about the manner of Mr Johnson's exit.

Watch: Isabel Oakeshott reveals why she leaked the messages\n\nMuch of the media has done what it does best - talk feverishly to itself about the rights and wrongs of the way the story emerged after Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who co-wrote Mr Hancock's book, passed thousands of his messages to a newspaper without his permission.\n\nThe chats have illustrated, in sometimes toe-curling levels of detail, the way in which government figures communicate - described as \"teenage with LOLS\" by one Tory MP. They include sweary messages about Dominic Cummings, who was Mr Johnson's chief adviser, and reveal a love-hate relationship between Mr Hancock and his then-Cabinet colleague Michael Gove.\n\nAnd it's given colour and context to the arguments that were raging at the top of government in 2020, during the first few scrambled months of the pandemic.\n\nThere is intriguing and seemingly perplexing detail in Saturday's information dump, where Mr Hancock seems to suggest the government was covering up rises in Covid cases as a result of then-Chancellor Mr Sunak's \"Eat Out To Help Out\" scheme. It was reported in October 2020 - after the scheme was up and running - that it could have contributed to the second wave.\n\nAs Health Secretary, Matt Hancock gave regular Downing St media briefings during the pandemic\n\nThe opposition is already asking pointedly what the government knew at the time.\n\nGiven that the scheme had Mr Sunak's signature on it, those questions could prove awkward for the current administration - even though broadly, so far, the Telegraph's set of stories has not sparked a huge reckoning over whether lockdown was the right thing to do.\n\nBut the effects of the pandemic are still being felt in so many profound ways - these stories, the lasting effect on the economy, and the Covid inquiry that is likely to run for many, many months and is only just getting off the ground.\n\nThe latest findings from officialdom on Partygate have \"revived the embers\" too, according to a former cabinet minister. A committee of MPs has pinpointed several occasions when they believe Mr Johnson might not have told the truth in Parliament.\n\nIn Westminster, that's the sin of all sins - one that's punishable with an MP potentially having to fight for their seat again.\n\nLet's spell this out. If this committee concludes the former prime minister knew he was not being straight, he might be suspended as an MP - and then possibly face a by-election.\n\nThe midway report from the Privileges Committee also contains gobbets of exasperation from Mr Johnson's staff as they struggled to contain the Partygate story that was crashing down all around them.\n\nMr Johnson used the publication of yesterday's report to claim it vindicated what he has said all along, that he never held Parliament in contempt, and that he never knowingly misled anyone.\n\nTo be crystal clear - that is not, not yet, what the committee of MPs says. This report does not provide that or any conclusions, as committee members have not yet finished their work. They will question Mr Johnson himself in a couple of weeks.\n\nEven some Conservatives reckon the committee is likely to take a very dim view of what the PM did. \"If he thinks he'll get a clean bill of health, he can think again,\" one says.\n\nReviving memories of Partygate, and the public upset and outrage that came alongside it, is hardly helpful for the Conservatives.\n\nMr Sunak was never painted as one of the dastardly villains of the saga - but having also received a fine for attending Mr Johnson's birthday in the Cabinet room, it's easy for the opposition to paint him as part of the mess too.\n\nOne Tory MP says that \"the danger is that Partygate and privileges and everything - it just all damages us\".\n\nAnd there's been an unexpected and fraught added dimension to all this too.\n\nThe government, and Whitehall, were shocked when news broke that civil service enforcer, Sue Gray, was leaving government to work for the Labour Party. There was genuine shock, even among some of her former colleagues, that she would take that step. That's because it is vital that civil servants are, and are seen to be, totally fair and neutral.\n\nLabour reckon it's a coup to have a \"grown up person preparing for a grown up government\", according to one source. There is no doubt Ms Gray is a hugely experienced operator.\n\nOver the years, I've spoken to many people who have worked with her and I've heard almost universal praise. Nor is it unheard of for officials to leave, then go on to work for politicians. Both Tony Blair and David Cameron's chiefs of staff were both employed in Whitehall before moving into politics.\n\nBut the manner of Ms Gray's departure, and her reputation for holding all SW1's secrets, has caused uproar. Not just because, as one Conservative MP says simply, \"it seems unfair\" to many of their colleagues - but also because you might know Ms Gray's name, because she is the person who investigated Partygate.\n\nConservative MPs have expressed anger that Sue Gray has been offered a job as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff\n\nThe fact that she carried out the Whitehall investigation into what happened in No 10, and now is leaving for opposition, gave immediate ammunition to Mr Johnson's supporters to cry foul, to claim that he was the victim of some kind of stitch up after all.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ms Gray's report did not, in fact, throw the book at the former PM personally. Mr Johnson's eventual resignation came some months later.\n\nBut - as another Tory MP, no fan of Mr Johnson, suggests - Ms Gray's decision fuels a sense of conspiracy heard among some constituents. \"It makes Boris a victim, and fuels some of the stuff about Westminster stitch ups we see online.\"\n\nThere is a risk here for Labour, that they are presented as part of some kind of establishment plot. And by preparing for government like this, are they, as one former minister snipes, \"measuring the bloody curtains\"?\n\nWhether it's the spat over the hiring of Ms Gray or the furore over his views on the new Northern Ireland deal, \"the shadow of Boris Johnson looms\", says the MP. It \"defies logic\", they claim, that a \"disgraced former PM\" still occupies so much of his party's bandwidth.\n\nBut the hangover from a once in a generation politician does not fade fast, even though there have been not just one, but two people who have moved into No 10 since he left. We've seen again this week - there are parts of the Conservative Party still preoccupied with his legacy, who still relish an argument about what went on.\n\nThe events of the past few years have been so intense, shaken things so fundamentally, that a clean break is extremely hard to achieve.\n\nMr Sunak wants to mark progress on Brexit, crack on with trying to solve the problem of small boats that cross the Channel (expect a tricky debate on that this week with the likely publication of more draft laws), pull off a smooth meeting with the French president, and look ahead to the Budget in 10 days' time.\n\nThe Brexit deal, which still hasn't been approved by the DUP, does show that his head-down, no-drama approach can bear fruit.\n\nOne Tory MP says that while \"we won't get electoral credit, it does show he's competent, you can't see the foundations of a house, but you have to build them\".\n\nBut the past few days have shown that the forces that have been at work in recent years still have the power to disrupt.\n\nOne Whitehall insider jokes, \"who had 'strong and stable' in the sweepstake under Rishi?\" - with the massive events of the recent past, that doesn't look like a safe bet.", "Images of the natural world, including wildflowers, birds and insects, adorn King Charles III's invitation\n\nThe first images of King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation invitations have been released.\n\nThe ornate invites, printed on recycled paper, have been sent to 2,000 guests ahead of the 6 May celebration.\n\nThe invites form part of longstanding tradition, with the oldest coronation notes on file dating back to King George III's coronation in 1761.\n\nIn tribute to the upcoming coronation, the Royal Archives has unearthed invites across the monarchy's history.\n\nThey capture not only the evolving tastes of the royal family, but a snapshot of that time in history.\n\nThe invitation to King George III's coronation is the oldest surviving invite in the British monarchy's history\n\nThe oldest document reproduced by the Palace on Wednesday is from the coronation of King George III and Queen Charlotte on 22 September 1761.\n\nIt depicts the pair sitting alongside each other in Westminster Abbey, as winged angels flit above them and an expectant crowd watches on.\n\nThe image of the smiling couple intimately holding the orb and cross together suggests a well-worn intimacy - but in fact, George III had met his bride just a fortnight earlier.\n\nThe young king had ascended to the throne almost a year earlier upon the death of his grandfather George II, and was at that time a bachelor. He was 22 years old.\n\nCharlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a minor princess from northern Germany, was identified as a suitable bride and a marriage contract was signed before they'd even met. She was just 17 years old.\n\nShe was brought to England to meet her new husband and they married a matter of hours after setting eyes on each for the first time.\n\nThe Duchess of Kent used this admission ticket for the coronation of her daughter, Queen Victoria, in 1838\n\nThe second-longest serving monarch in British history, Queen Victoria, was crowned when she was just 18, and reigned for a total of 67 years.\n\nQueen Victoria's bright red and green invites were the first to be printed in colour, as well as the first to feature a blind embossed seal from the Earl Marshal of England. To this date, the serving Earl Marshal - a hereditary royal officeholder - sends out and marks all coronation invites.\n\nQueen Victoria's coronation was planned for 28 June 1838 and was much more of a grand and public occasion than the austere ceremony favoured by her uncle, King William IV.\n\nThe Queen drove from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey in full state procession, in a Gold State Coach pulled by eight cream horses.\n\nAbout 400,000 people lined the streets to see the coronation procession travel through London and the Queen.\n\nThe ceremony lasted a lengthy five hours, and as the Royal Archives notes, did not go completely according to plan.\n\nThe Queen recorded in her journal: \"The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, the consequence being that I had the greatest difficulty in taking it off again, which I at last succeeded in doing, but not without great pain\".\n\nRoyal underdog George VI had to step up to the plate after his brother's shock abdication in 1936\n\nHe was never expected to ascend to the throne, but King George VI rose to the challenge when his brother, Edward VIII, announced his shock abdication in December 1936.\n\nEdward VIII had ascended to the throne earlier that year and, although resistant to the idea of a coronation ceremony at all, a date was set for 12 May 1937.\n\nPreparations were well under way by the time he abdicated over his proposed marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee.\n\nBut it was his brother, George VI, who was anointed King in Westminster Abbey that day - three days shy of his 41st birthday.\n\nThe bold design of the invite, featuring a border of dominions, emblems and shields of arms, also paid tribute to the wider British Empire at the time, including India, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's simple but elegant coronation invite was designed by Joan Hassall\n\nA modern-minded monarch, Queen Elizabeth II's coronation made history as the first to be televised.\n\nAn estimated 27 million people watched the coronation live, over half the population of Britain, while a further 11 million people listened on the radio.\n\nWood engraver and book illustrator Joan Hassall designed the invite. Two decades later, she made history as the first woman to be elected a Master of the Art Workers' Guild. Ms Hassall became known to the Queen in 1948, when she won a competition to design a new \u00a31 postage stamp.\n\nFor Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation in 1953, the young Prince Charles received his own specially illustrated invitation. The invitation, featuring colourful trumpeting and drumming soldiers, was also designed by Ms Hassall.\n\nThe invitation on recycled paper uses the folklore figure of the 'green man'\n\nKing Charles will be 74 when he is crowned on 6 May, but his invitation speaks to his progressive and green connection with the natural world.\n\nHis coronation invite was designed by Andrew Jamieson, a heraldic artist and manuscript illuminator whose work is inspired by the chivalric themes of Arthurian legend. Mr Jamieson is a Brother of the Art Workers' Guild, of which the King is an honorary member.\n\nReflecting the King's many years of environmental campaigning, the artwork for the coronation invitation uses the folklore figure of the \"green man\", with features made from ivy, hawthorn and oak leaves.\n\nThe original artwork for the invitation was hand-painted in watercolour and gouache.\n\nIn touch with the King's green credentials, the design will be reproduced and printed on recycled card, with gold foil detailing.\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace it is a symbol of spring and rebirth which celebrates a new reign.\n\nThe design also includes images of the natural world, including wildflowers, birds and insects native to the UK, as well as national and heraldic emblems.", "The prime minister has refused to explicitly commit to a Conservative promise to get net migration levels below where they were four years ago.\n\nThe Tory manifesto before the general election in 2019 promised that \"overall numbers will come down\".\n\nNet migration - the number of people moving to the UK minus the number who leave - was 226,000 in the year to March 2019.\n\nIn the year to June 2022, net migration hit an all-time high of 504,000.\n\nThe latest number, for the year to December 2022, will be published next week - and is widely expected to be higher still.\n\nSpeaking to reporters en route to the G7 Summit in Japan, Rishi Sunak said: \"I've inherited some numbers, I want to bring the numbers down.\"\n\nAs the numbers climb, he is maintaining a desire that they fall, but not explicitly below the level they were at when the initial promise was made.\n\n\"When it comes to legal migration, the key thing for people to know is we're in control of why people are here, the circumstances and the terms on which they are here, making sure they contribute, to public services like the NHS for example,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"Those are all now part of our migration system and they weren't before,\" he added, in reference to Brexit - which means immigration policy is now decided solely at Westminster.\n\nThere is some evidence that the importance attached to cutting immigration has fallen for some people since the UK left the European Union, suggesting control over it, as well as how much of it there is, does really matter to some.\n\nAs I have written about here, there is quite a discussion going on within government about how to respond to next week's new net migration figure.\n\nMr Sunak is travelling to Japan for the G7 summit in Hiroshima\n\nI am told the prime minister has not yet looked at it in detail. But he is likely to in the coming days, ahead of a government announcement which is expected to include a restriction on the dependents some foreign students can bring with them when they come to the UK to study.\n\nStrikingly, when pressed on his instincts on legal migration, the prime minister repeatedly changed the subject to talk about illegal immigration instead - small boat crossings.\n\n\"I do think most people's number one priority when it comes to migration is illegal migration, that is crystal clear to me,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"That's why one of my five priorities is to stop the boats, that's why recently we have moved to a Covid-style committee structure where I am meeting twice a week with ministers to drive the implementation of the new bill,\" he added, referring to the Illegal Migration Bill.\n\nHe also pointed out what he believes is a significant breakthrough in helping to limit the number of small boats crossing the Channel.\n\nConservative peer Lord Jackson has warned the PM against dropping a 2019 manifesto pledge to reduce migration levels.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Politics Live, he said a rise in net migration could lead to people giving up on the Tory party. \"I do think that if you seem to not take seriously this issue, there's a problem,\" he said.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council of Europe in Iceland on Tuesday, the European Union agreed to begin conversations about the UK having a cooperation agreement with Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency.\n\nThere has been no such agreement since Brexit.\n\nSuch an agreement, Mr Sunak said, was \"of practical value to us in stopping illegal migration - sharing intelligence, operational cooperation will make a difference to our ability to stop the boats.\"", "As part of a special show to celebrate the Fourth of July, the world's largest LED was completely illuminated in Las Vegas, creating a new landmark on the Las Vegas skyline.\n\nThe sphere is made up of approximately 1.2 million LED pucks.

Another showed the perpetrator lying dead on the ground.\n\nBoth clips were visible at or near the top of search results in the hours after news broke of the attack north of Dallas.\n\nMany users expressed shock at how easily the footage spread, mostly without content warnings.\n\n\"I'm currently feeling overwhelmed by the horrific videos circulating around Allen, Texas,\" one wrote. \"Twitter's moderation team needs to step up.\"\n\n\"I've also been noticing a lot more shocking and sometimes gory content on Twitter showing up on my feed,\" said Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism expert at Queen's University in Toronto.\n\nStaff cuts at Twitter, he suggested, meant the company no longer had the expertise to advise on nuanced content removal or when to add warning messages on sensitive and graphic content.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

In one instance, a post from an account with around 1,000 followers was viewed at least 1.3 million times before it was deleted by its author.\n\nIt falsely claimed that the assailant was a black supremacist who shouted slogans against white people before the shooting. A similar tweet from a parody account got 70,000 views despite only having 100 followers.\n\nIn reality, investigators are looking into whether the killer had neo-Nazi or white supremacist links. The suspect, Mauricio Garcia, aged 33, wore a patch that said \"RWDS\", short for \"Right Wing Death Squad\", a slogan used by many far-right activists.\n\nMisinformation expert Marc Owen Jones, associate professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, says that similar false messages were spread by a number of accounts, including some that had paid for the company's premium \"blue tick\".\n\n\"I don't necessarily think there is something different under Musk with regards to violent content,\" he said, \"but I was also surprised that some of the graphic content lingered after being so heavily retweeted.\" This should be low-hanging fruit for moderators, he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTwitter is a member of Christchurch Call, an organisation founded by the New Zealand and French governments after the 2019 Christchurch shootings with the aim of preventing terrorist and violent extremist content from spreading online.\n\nThe tech companies signed up to a pledge to review algorithms and other processes \"that may drive users towards and/or amplify\" such content.\n\nThe company no longer has a press team that responds to questions, and neither Mr Musk or the company's communications account responded to a tweet.\n\nLate on Sunday, Twitter moderators approved at least one viral copy of one of the graphic videos, stating in response to a user report that it did not violate the site's policy on sensitive content.\n\nBy Monday, the videos containing the most graphic shots of dead bodies did start disappearing from the platform.\n\nInstead, a new trend was dominating search results for the shooting: edited clips showing a few brief frames of graphic material, with messages urging users to click on links to view the rest.

In the history of the Oscars, no other film has ever won best picture, best director and three acting prizes.\n\nIn Everything Everywhere All at Once, Yeoh plays a Chinese-American laundrette owner who is mired in a tax audit, stuck in a crumbling marriage and struggling to connect with her daughter Joy.\n\nBut when she discovers different versions of herself in the multiverse, she must tap into their skills in order to save the world.\n\n\"This is proof that dreams do come true,\" Yeoh said in her speech. \"I have to dedicate this to all the moms in the world because they are the superheroes, and without them, none of us would be here tonight.\"\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once directors Daniel Scheinert (left), Daniel Kwan (right) and producer Jonathan Wang (centre)\n\nThe 60-year-old enjoyed a late surge in momentum in this year's Oscars race, ultimately overtaking the early frontrunner Cate Blanchett.\n\nYeoh is only the second woman of colour to win best leading actress, following Halle Berry for Monster's Ball more than two decades ago.\n\nBest leading actress has historically been far less diverse than the supporting actress category, where Ariana DeBose, Yuh-jung Youn, Regina King, Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong'o and Octavia Spencer have won in the past decade.\n\nElsewhere, Brendan Fraser capped his extraordinary comeback after years away from the Hollywood spotlight by winning best actor for his performance in The Whale.\n\nThanking the film's director, the 54-year-old said: \"I'm grateful to Darren Aronofsky for throwing me a creative lifeline.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to say thank you for this acknowledgement,\" he said.\n\nAddressing his fellow nominees, he said: \"You laid your whale-sized hearts so we could see into your souls, like no-one else could do, and it is my honour to be named alongside you in this category.\"\n\nFraser was a huge film star at the turn of the millennium, starring in films such as George of the Jungle and The Mummy.\n\nBut he spent years out of the spotlight as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, mostly taking on smaller roles.\n\nThat changed when he was cast in The Whale as an overweight professor trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter.\n\nFraser transformed his appearance for the film, which also won best make-up and hairstyling.\n\nMuch like Fraser, best supporting actor winner Quan has enjoyed a comeback narrative this awards season.

It now says GDP - the value of the goods and services the country produces - fell by 0.1%, compared with its previous estimate of a 0.2% fall.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the figures \"show there's underlying resilience in the UK economy\".\n\nHowever, he added that \"families up and down the country are facing real pressure\".\n\nA recession is usually defined as when the economy contracts for two three-month periods in a row, so the growth at the end of 2022 means the UK avoided one.\n\nLast week, the Bank of England said that the economy was expected to grow only slightly in the coming months.\n\nHowever, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said he was \"much more hopeful\" for the economy, and it was no longer heading into an immediate recession.\n\nMr Bailey's comments came after the Bank increased interest rates to 4.25% from 4%.\n\nInterest rates have been repeatedly hiked as the Bank attempts to get the soaring pace of price rises under control.\n\nInflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, remains close to its highest level for 40 years, and hit 10.4% in the year to February.\n\nRuth Gregory of Capital Economics said the revised ONS figures showed that high inflation took a slightly smaller toll on the economy than thought.\n\nHowever, she said most of the impact of higher rates was yet to be felt.\n\n\"We still think the economy will slip into a recession this year,\" she said.\n\nSeparately, house prices slid in March at the fastest annual rate since 2009, mortgage lender Nationwide said.", "Footage widely shared online shows police using tear gas against people in the city of Marseille, in southern France.\n\nThe video is from Saturday evening and shows clashes taking place on La Canebi\u00e8re, which is the city's main avenue.\n\nFrance has been rocked by five nights of unrest after police fatally shot a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent, Nahel, in the Paris suburb of Nanterre.", "Rishi Sunak's spokesperson says he will assist the commissioner in investigating the interest\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is being investigated by Parliament's standards watchdog over a possible failure to declare an interest.\n\nMr Sunak is being investigated over whether a declaration of interest was \"open and frank\", under rules set out by the commissioner for standards.\n\nThe BBC understands the probe relates to a childcare firm his wife has shares in.\n\nThe commissioner decides whether an MP has broken rules after an inquiry.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We are happy to assist the commissioner to clarify how this has been transparently declared as a ministerial interest.\"\n\nLast month, Mr Sunak faced questions over shares his wife, Akshata Murty, holds in Koru Kids, a childcare agency that could benefit from a new policy unveiled in the spring Budget.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt announced a pilot of payments for new childminders, with more for those who sign up through agencies.\n\nMs Murty was listed as a shareholder in one of those agencies, Koru Kids, as recently as 6 March.\n\nMr Sunak did not mention Ms Murty's links to Koru Kids when he was questioned by MPs over the childcare policy at a parliamentary committee hearing on 28 March.\n\nLabour MP Catherine McKinnell asked Mr Sunak whether he had any interest to declare, and in reply he said: \"No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way.\"\n\nIn a letter to the committee, sent a few days after the hearing, Mr Sunak said his wife's interest was declared to the Cabinet Office and that an updated statement of ministers' interests would be due out shortly.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Sunak said the the list of ministerial interests \"ensures steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any potential conflict of interest\".\n\nThe list of ministerial interests is separate to the register of interests for MPs, which says members \"must always consider whether they have a conflict of interest\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

There are many of these investigations every year but most end with a minor telling off from the commissioner.\n\nMr Johnson has been a serial offender when it comes to the late declaration of earnings and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had to apologise for something similar last year.\n\nThe rules are there for a reason though and it is all about transparency.

Watch: 'They've taken my baby' - Mother of teen shot by police\n\nThe killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up.\n\nAn only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league.\n\nHis education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician.\n\nThose who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father.\n\nHis record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record.\n\nHe had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\".\n\nShortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence.\n\n\"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\"\n\nHis grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\".\n\n\"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nNahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen.\n\nThe programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician.\n\nOvale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\".\n\n\"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien.\n\nHe praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media.\n\nHe had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate.\n\nShortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters.\n\nHis mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\"\n\n\"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium.\n\nFlowers were left at the site where Nahel died\n\n\"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel.\n\nBut the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice.\n\n\"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtemp\u00e9rer - refusing to comply with an order to stop.\n\nWhen he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence.\n\nAs recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.\n\nHis name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations.\n\nLast September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\".

And so it now collects far less data on that type of content, and also doesn't send personalised ads to people watching that content,\" she said.\n\n\"The solution exists, they just need to pull it out of the toolbox.\"\n\u2022 None Children's internet code: What is it and how will it work?", "Falkirk will play for a place in the semi final\n\nFull BBC Scotland coverage of Falkirk's Scottish Cup quarter-final against Ayr United went ahead following weekend sport disruption.\n\nProgramming was limited amid the row over presenter Gary Lineker, who was taken off air after tweeting about UK government migration policy.\n\nFollowing talks with the BBC, the Match of the Day host will resume his role.\n\nBBC Scotland coverage of Monday's Scottish Cup tie was broadcast on TV, radio and online.\n\nFalkirk beat Ayr United to take a place in the semi-final where they will play Inverness CT.

moment of triumph with President Biden jetting in to celebrate the return of power sharing at Stormont.\n\nA moment to remember an old agreement 25 years on and look forward to a new one bringing some much-needed political stability.\n\nProvisions were even in place for a special presidential address to returning assembly members (MLAs) in the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber.\n\nThe Windsor Framework agreed between London and Brussels to revise the Northern Ireland Protocol was considered the game changer.\n\nBut the DUP clearly didn't get the Whitehouse memo.\n\nThe party's Stormont boycott remains intact as the president's great plans were left in tatters.\n\nInstead we have been left with a scaled-down presidential visit with just one public engagement in Belfast lasting just over an hour.\n\nBut, for many, the significance of a visit by a US president cannot be measured in minutes.\n\nIt puts a global spotlight on Northern Ireland - if even for an afternoon - which countries elsewhere can only dream off.\n\nHarnessing that moment and maximising the opportunity is the challenge for both businesses and political leaders.\n\nA task not helped by the lack of a functioning Stormont.\n\nThe president's visit has been scaled down\n\nThough pressed for time today, Joe Biden is making space to meet the party leaders for a brief chat ahead of his speech at Ulster University.\n\nMuch of the focus will be on his discussions with DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\n\nWill he apply some presidential pressure or gently try to nudge the party back to power sharing?\n\nIn truth, the DUP is beyond the reach of President Biden as the party has already slipped into election mode.\n\nNow is not the time for compromise with the council elections next month.\n\nThe best President Biden can hope for is a DUP commitment to revisit its Northern Ireland Executive boycott in the autumn.\n\nMaybe then legislation will be in place to ease the DUP's constitutional concerns.\n\nHowever, President Biden will wave the potential of fresh US investment to tempt the DUP to new ground.\n\nExpect to hear more about that pledge in the president's speech with his special economic envoy Joe Kennedy standing in the wings.\n\nHe will talk up the opportunities of dual market access as protected through the Windsor Framework.\n\nBut when it comes to the Stormont stalemate, he will likely chose his words carefully.\n\nSingling out the DUP will only serve to deepen the party's mistrust of the Biden administration.\n\nHe must find the words to acknowledge the deep frustration of the other Stormont parties without completely isolating Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and his party.\n\nThat's a task made easier against the backdrop of a new university campus and not a deserted assembly chamber.\n\nPresident Biden will also focus on local businesses success stories in his speech and expect him to name drop some faces in the audience.\n\nBut absent from the gathering will be the man who invited the president to Northern Ireland.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak will be missing as he has another engagement.\n\nOn the surface that appears odd and only adds to reports of strained relations between Downing Street and the Whitehouse over the scaled-down visit.\n\nDowning Street has been working hard to play up the significance of the prime minister's role.\n\nFirstly rejecting Whitehouse claims the meeting between Mr Biden and Mr Sunak on Wednesday morning is nothing more than a chat over coffee.\n\nThere are reports of strained relations between Downing Street and the Whitehouse over the scaled-down visit\n\nThen Number 10 rejected suggestions the prime minister's role was \"low key\".\n\nSo don't be surprised if the prime minister's other private engagement, pulling him away from the president's one and only public event, is made public.\n\nBy then, the presidential cavalcade will likely have left Northern Ireland en route to Dublin.\n\nTogether with his sister and close confidante Valerie and his son Hunter, President Biden will revisit his ancestral roots in counties Louth and Mayo.\n\nIt will be a trip laced with all the positive images of a returning Irish-American president.\n\nThe images which will come in handy when President Biden finally declares his plan to run for a second term in office.\n\nWith 30m Americans claiming to have Irish roots, any opportunity to reaffirm his Irish connections is a potential vote winner for President Biden.\n\nWhen he climbs the steps of Airforce One on Friday, it

unions.\n\nIt is part of the process of drawing up a manifesto for government, although not the final word.\n\nSome unions had been pressing for more generous pledges.\n\nOften in such meetings, compromises are reached behind closed doors.\n\nBut Labour leadership sources say they stood firm over the three days of talks in opposing any policy proposals that would have led to new spending commitments.\n\nThe sources insist they had been determined not to give unnecessary ammunition to their political opponents.\n\nA spokesman said: \"This weekend is proof that Keir Starmer has changed the Labour Party, and is ready to change the country in government built on the rock of economic responsibility.\"\n\nOne union, USDAW, which saw its hopes of changes to the benefits system dashed, nonetheless described the policy discussions as constructive.\n\nThe GMB union said that \"after several days of negotiations\", it had secured an \"historic commitment\" to strengthening equal pay rights.\n\nThe party's largest union funder, Unite, was far less pleased.\n\nIn a statement, the union accused the Labour leadership of watering down existing commitments' to workers' rights and ending zero-hours contracts.\n\nIt said: \"As the general election draws nearer Keir Starmer has to prove Labour will deliver for workers and we need clear policies on this.\"\n\nIt described the policy-making process as \"chaotic.\"\n\nThe left-wing group Momentum criticised what it called Sir Keir Starmer's \"fiscal conservatism\".\n\nA spokesman said: \"This has put paid to any hope of the bold, transformative policies we need.\"\n\nHe argued that a higher minimum wage, and free school meals, would have been popular policies but had been rejected.\n\nFurther discussions will take place with the unions before a final election manifesto is agreed.\n\nBut the party leadership has been focussed on emphasising one message above all for the wider electorate - that it would not promise what it does not think it can deliver in government.", "In animation, there's a golden rule that characters should be recognisable by their silhouette alone.\n\nIt's a principle that must have been familiar to whoever designed Pulp's reunion tour - because Jarvis Cocker is constantly thrown into relief on the big screens at Latitude festival.\n\nBritpop's very own angle-poise lamp, his unorthodox dance moves are instantly recognisable, full of side lunges, sharp elbows and fluttering hands.\n\nWhen his outline is beamed high above the crowd at Latitude festival, it's like a giant, wondrous special effect. Who needs fireworks when Jarvis is here? (We get fireworks too, though that comes later).\n\nPulp come to Latitude towards the end of a summer-long reunion tour, 22 years after their last record, and a decade after they last played live.\n\n\"This is what we do for an encore,\" the video screens announce before they take the stage. But if time has moved on, the songs sound remarkably fresh.\n\nDisco 2000 is essentially a British Abba song, all suburban disappointment and thumping disco beats; Babies is a voyeur's manifesto and Mis-shapes is the soundtrack to the revenge of the outcasts.\n\nThose hits prompt mass sing-alongs - not just from the adults who saw them first time around, but from their kids as well.\n\nCocker, meanwhile, is just as dry and mischievous as ever. \"Feeling ok? We'll soon see about that,\" he intones ominously as the show begins.\n\nThe band's reunion tour culminates with two nights in London's Hammersmith Apollo next week\n\nBut really, he's in a party mood. The band have been soaking up the festival all day and before long he's laughing at people who've stapled underwear to their flag poles, and throwing chocolates into the crowd. \"My doctor's here tonight so he wouldn't agree with this,\" he observes.\n\nCocker even tells the story of his girlfriend visiting one of the festival's many stalls and trying on a dragon's tail, \"which I found strangely exciting, actually\".\n\nThere's always been a curious innocence to his vice, which amount to things like glimpsing a bra strap (Underwear) or imagining the shape of someone's breasts (F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.)\n\nEven the provocatively-titled This Is Hardcore is really about the seedy parallels between the porn industry and the music business. Guess which one comes off worse?\n\nRevisiting the songs, the band have never sounded better.\n\nSpread across a grand Hollywood musical staircase, and augmented by the Elysian Collective sting section, they bring a new cinematic grandeur to Misfits, and a swirling, hypnotic energy to Do You Remember The First Time?\n\nA poignant Something Changed is dedicated to bass guitarist Steve Mackey, who died earlier this year at the age of 56; and Sunrise, which Cocker performs in front of a dazzling, white-hot globe of lightbulbs, is a stirring end to the main set.\n\nThat said, some of the more obscure tracks don't go down so well. Like A Friend, a rarity from the soundtrack to 1998's Great Expectations, feels like a particularly odd choice for a festival set, especially when they omit the fan favourite Razzmatazz.\n\nBut the band know everyone's waiting for one song in particular.\n\n\"Have we forgotten something?\" asks Cocker, pretending the set has ended. \"Haven't we played David's Last Summer?\"\n\nThen, with a nod and a wink, they rev up an extended, blood-quickening version of Common People.\n\nIf anything, the song's scathing tale of poverty tourism has gained even more bite as it approaches 30, and the gap between rich and poor widens even further.\n\nCocker snarls his way through it, standing astride two monitors, his fist pumping the air as the crowd sing along, before it ends in a flurry of pyrotechnics and confetti.\n\nAs with Blur's Wembley Stadium shows a fortnight ago, it's a reminder that Britpop wasn't all about beers and blokes.

But the UK research community has constantly and unanimously argued for membership of the European Horizon programme.\n\nIf Mr Sunak rejects the options on his desk, the anger from the scientific establishment will be ''unimaginable\", according to a senior scientific leader.\n\nShould events go as expected, the deal will come as a huge relief to the scientific community. Many of the UK's leading researchers have been left in limbo over the future of their world-leading research projects and in some cases their own jobs and those of their teams.\n\nNobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse: \"Prime minister should finalise the deal without further delay\"\n\nAssociate membership had been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement when the UK formally left the EU at the end of January 2020. But the arrangement was not activated because of a disagreement over the Northern Ireland protocol. This was resolved in February of this year and it had been hoped that a deal for Horizon would swiftly follow.\n\nThe EU waived the UK's joining fee for the time it had not been a member, but it stuck to the arrangement agreed with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government about the funding the UK would be expected to receive.\n\nThe government had agreed that if UK researchers received less than 12% of what the UK put in, Britain could terminate the arrangement. The figure for other associate members of Horizon is 8%, but it was thought to be a price worth paying for continuing to be part of the programme by the government at the time.\n\nTalks since the Windsor agreement have focussed largely on renegotiating this figure to be more in line with that of other associate members. It is understood that two formulae have now been agreed between the UK and EU, which await the prime minister's signature.\n\nThe stand-off has bemused UK researchers because pre-Brexit the UK received around \u00a3500m more than the \u00a31.5bn a year it put in. For Horizon the government has agreed to pay approximately \u00a32bn a year and given the quality of British science, the research community believes it would get at least the same amount back. Many feel that months have been lost haggling over a hypothetical point.\n\nNews that a draft agreement had been reached was reported on Wednesday afternoon by Politico, but was greeted by a terse statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\n\n\"Talks are ongoing and, therefore, we have not yet agreed a deal.\"\n\nThe UK has some of the best scientists in the world, but some have now moved to EU institutions because of uncertainty over Horizon\n\nOn Thursday morning Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said the Prime Minister was keen to seek \"value for money for taxpayers\" if the UK is to rejoin the scheme, with \"constructive\" discussions still going on.\n\n''I think overall we want to make sure that any deal, whether it is Horizon or the UK alternative Pioneer, is the one that produces the best value for UK science and research and also for taxpayers. That is what the Prime Minister will consider at the appropriate time.\"\n\nJames Wilsdon, a professor of science policy at University College London, told BBC News what while this was \"wonderful news\" the uncertainty over the past three years had \"blighted\" UK-EU scientific collaboration.\n\n\"In haggling over the budget, the UK was in danger of being penny wise but pound foolish \u2014 emphasising short-term costs over the huge long-term gains that will flow from UK participation.\n\n\"Hopefully, a compromise has now been reached and the research community can move forward with the clarity and commitment that it has been crying out for.\"\n\nProfessor Lord Krebs, a long-serving and respected scientific adviser to the government from the University of Oxford, said: \"Delays over two years have caused serious and lasting damage to UK R&D.\"\n\nNobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse said the prime minister should finalise the deal \"without further delay\", a view echoed by Prof Sarah Main, executive director of Campaign for Science and Engineering.\n\n\"I urge the prime minister and president of the European Commission to secure this agreement, enabling researchers to get on with the vital role they play in improving people's lives and livelihoods,\" she said.\n\nVivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, also urged the prime minister to finalise the deal, saying there were a lot of people in Europe \"with their fingers and toes crossed that it gets across the line\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said that among the benefits of joining the programme were greater opportunities for research collaboration - as well as access to larger grants for UK universities.\n\nThe UK is also seeking to rejoin the Copernicus Earth observation programme.", "Water companies released raw sewage into rivers and seas in England for more than 1.75 million hours last year.\n\nThere were an average of 825 sewage spills into waterways per day, the data shows - down 19% on the previous year.\n\nBut the Environment Agency put the fall largely down to drier weather, not water company action.\n\nAlthough not illegal, academics and environmental groups say releasing sewage poses a danger to human health.\n\nCompanies release sewage when there is too much demand on their treatment works during rainy periods.\n\nContained within the untreated effluent is human waste, wet wipes and sanitary products, which pose a serious risk to the local wildlife, swimmers and others who use UK waterways.\n\n\"This degrades precious ecosystems and poses a danger to public health,\" said Prof Jamie Woodward, geography professor at the University of Manchester.\n\n\"Each discharge is a toxic cocktail of many pollutants, including microplastics and pathogens.\"\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nThe latest data, revealed by the Environment Agency on Friday, was taken from monitoring stations installed at combined sewer overflows or CSOs.

The alarms are wailing.\n\nBaroness Casey says the Metropolitan Police was expecting a report highlighting the things it needed to look at - but that, overall, the force thought she would say it's doing a good job.\n\n\"It's the exact opposite,\" she says.\n\nBaroness Casey has a reputation for no-nonsense reports. When Dame Cressida Dick, the former Scotland Yard Commissioner, asked her to review the Met, she must have known what she would get.\n\nNot the measured, dispassionate and legalistic volumes most institutional inquiries deliver.\n\nHer language is often emotional and uncompromising, a style that appeals to journalists and politicians looking for a headline.\n\nThis report is so ferocious in its criticism that, in the short term, it is almost certain that trust and confidence levels in the police in London - already down - will plummet further.\n\nWith forces across England and Wales, like the Met, re-vetting all their officers, more scandals will emerge.\n\nEvery misconduct hearing, every court case, is going to damage public confidence.\n\nAccused of institutional prejudice, it seems unlikely that, in the short term at least, this report is going to make it easier to recruit women, or those from the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minorities.\n\nMorale is not going to be improved by a report that is so merciless in its criticism of the Met and its culture.\n\nA generation after the Macpherson report found the Metropolitan Police to be institutionally racist, here we are again. Only worse. Sexism and homophobia are added to the list.\n\nThe report notes that in 1972, on his appointment as commissioner of the force, Sir Robert Mark said he had \"never experienced\u2026blindness, arrogance and prejudice on anything like the scale accepted as routine in the Met\".\n\nThe report immediately adds that the Met is a very different organisation today. But five decades on, Louise Casey says: \"We have found those cultures alive and well\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Baroness Casey on her blistering report of the Met police\n\nThe question is really about whether police forces turn things around quickly enough.\n\nThe report talks about reviewing progress against various measures after two and five years. Politicians are suggesting they will want to see results within two years.\n\nBut with a general election likely next year, and manifestos being written even sooner, will politicians show the patience Sir Mark Rowley, the current incumbent in Scotland Yard, says he requires? Especially if more bad headlines see public anxiety increase still further.\n\nBaroness Casey hints at breaking up the Met, if things don't improve. But that kind of major reform of policing feels some way off.\n\nAs things stand, there is no blueprint for a reorganised system in England and Wales - and politicians of all stripes seem content to give Sir Mark the benefit of the doubt for the moment.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman has said she will be \"holding the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London to account by measuring progress\", but adds that she currently has \"every confidence that Sir Mark Rowley and his team will deliver\".\n\nSuella Braverman delivering a statement on the Casey report to the Commons on Tuesday\n\nThe Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has pointed out that a collapse in trust in the Royal Ulster Constabulary among some communities in Northern Ireland resulted in the successful creation of a new police service, the PSNI.\n\nIs that a hint that a Labour government might institute more radical reform?\n\nParty insiders suggest they will be more hands-on than the current government has been in demanding progress, but there are no plans for systemic change - for now.\n\nWhat does progress look like? Public confidence figures must improve. Recruitment from minorities must increase. Corrupt officers must be identified and booted out. Vetting must be more effective. Whistleblowers must be supported. Morale must rise.\n\nSir Mark has already instituted measures he believes will move the dials. But that will take time. Changing culture and rebuilding trust cannot be done overnight.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the perilous state of British policing right now.\n\nThe tradition of policing by consent - the idea that officers serve as members of the public in uniform, exercising powers with the approval of the people they serve - relies on trust.\n\nBut as Baroness Casey baldly states: \"The Met has become disconnected from Londoners - their consent can no longer be assumed.\"\n\nTrust is formed at the point where the police meet the public. But the report finds bobbies who should be on the beat are behind desks, backfilling for civilian support staff who have been stripped out.\n\n\"The closer the Met get to Londoners, the more beleaguered the service\", is her damning conclusion.\n\nPerhaps the only way to sort out the Met was a nuclear option, a report so damning it takes the force back to ground zero.\n\nBut a huge question remains: Can a new police service emerge from the ashes with the clock ticking?", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Michael Gove says the Ukraine war and Covid pandemic made the UK poorer\n\nThe UK is poorer than it would have been, partly due to the war in Ukraine, but also the pandemic, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has admitted.\n\nBut he said ministers were taking action on the soaring cost of living, including giving help on energy bills.\n\nThe head of the independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said living standards were seeing their biggest squeeze on record.\n\nRichard Hughes said Brexit had been similar to the pandemic in its impact.\n\n\"It's a shock to the UK economy of the order of magnitude to other shocks that we've seen from the pandemic, from the energy crisis,\" he told the BBC.\n\nPoor productivity had also hurt growth, he said.\n\nAnd he warned living standards would not return to pre-pandemic levels for another five to six years.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with the OBR's assessments, Mr Gove said economic forecasting was \"a very difficult exercise\". He added that the UK was dealing with \"the aftershocks of two significant events\".\n\n\"[There's] both the war in Ukraine, the first time we've had war on this scale on the continent in Europe since the Second World War, and the Covid pandemic, the biggest global health pandemic since the end of the First World War,\" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\n\"They have had a huge effect on our economy and on others' economies.\"\n\nMr Gove denied that the government was to blame after 13 years in power, but added: \"One can always do better, yes.\"\n\nHowever, he insisted ministers were taking action to address soaring inflation - the rate at which prices rise - by taxing oil and gas firms' profits and lowering household energy bills.\n\nHe also said the Budget had taken steps to help people back to work and to help families, including with childcare.\n\nThe OBR forecasts that inflation will fall below 3% this year - down from 10.4% currently - as food and energy prices rise less quickly.\n\nBut speaking on the same programme, OBR chairman Richard Hughes said the outlook was volatile given Britain was a net importer of food and energy - the prices of which were set in global markets.\n\nMr Hughes added that the longer term outlook for the economy was bleak, with people's real spending power - allowing for inflation - not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade.\n\nMr Hughes blamed a range of issues for holding back the economy, saying: \"We've lost around 500,000 people from the labour force, we've seen stagnant investment since 2016 and also our productivity has slowed dramatically since the financial crisis and not really recovered.\"\n\nHe also said that overall output was forecast to be 4% lower than it would have been as a result of leaving the EU.\n\nLast week the Bank of England put up interest rates for the 11th time since December 2021 as it continued its battle to ease inflation.\n\nThe decision to lift rates to 4.25% from 4% came after the inflation rate rose unexpectedly last month to 10.4%.", "Steve Rodhouse -

The handsome young star sparked a fad for the genre with songs like Jamaica Farewell and Day-O (a song about Caribbean dock workers), both of which featured on his third album, Calypso.\n\nReleased in 1956, it topped the Billboard charts and was said to be the first album by a solo artist to sell more than a million copies in the US.\n\nThe singer's good looks made him a matinee idol\n\nHis success was such that he was the first black person allowed to perform in many upmarket US venues - including some that had been off-limits to artists like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nHis music endures in the streaming era - with the song Jump In The Line (Shake Senora) registering more than 115 million plays, thanks to its use in the Tim Burton film Beetlejuice.\n\nAs an actor, Belafonte made his Broadway debut in the musical John Murray Anderson's Almanac in 1953, for which he won a Tony Award for supporting actor. Hollywood soon came calling, and he scored his first lead role in Island in the Sun, where he starred alongside James Mason, Joan Fontaine and Joan Collins, with whom he had an affair.\n\nIn 1957, he was described in Look magazine as the first black matinee idol in entertainment history.\n\nHis achievements were all the more remarkable in an era when black actors were usually cast as maids and labourers, stereotypes that he refused to bow to. In 1959, he famously turned down the musical Porgy and Bess, describing the lead role as demeaning.\n\nHe continued making films into his 80s, making his final appearance in Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman.\n\nIn his music career, he recorded more than 30 albums, including collaborative records with Nana Mouskouri, Lena Horne, and Miriam Makeba.\n\nBob Dylan even made his first recorded appearance playing harmonica on Belafonte's 1962 album, Midnight Special.\n\nThe star was married three times, and leaves behind his wife, Pamela, as well as six children and eight grandchildren\n\nA close friend of Martin Luther King, the artist was a notable and visible supporter of the civil rights movement, who bankrolled several anti-segregation organisations and was known to have bailed Dr King and other activists out of jail.\n\nHe was one of the organisers of the 1963 March on Washington, and also took part in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965.\n\n\"Belafonte's global popularity and his commitment to our cause is a key ingredient to the global struggle for freedom and a powerful tactical weapon in the Civil Rights movement,\" Dr King once observed.\n\n\"We are blessed by his courage and moral integrity.\"\n\nThe star also campaigned against poverty, apartheid and Aids in Africa; and became an ambassador for Unicef, the United Nations children's fund.\n\nIn 1985, he organised the charity single We Are the World, an all-star musical collaboration that raised money for famine relief in Ethiopia.\n\nAfter watching a news report on the famine, he rallied artists to raise money in the same way Bob Geldof and Midge Ure had done with Band Aid in the UK a few weeks earlier.\n\nFeaturing Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles and Diana Ross among many others, the song - written by Jackson and Lionel Richie - generated millions of dollars for charity.\n\n\"A lot of people say to me, 'When as an artist did you decide to become an activist?'\" Belafonte said in a National Public Radio interview in 2011. \"I say to them, 'I was long an activist before I became an artist.'\"\n\nBelafonte was presented with the Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience award in 2013\n\nEven in his late 80s, Belafonte was still speaking out on race and income equality and urged President Barack Obama to do more to help the poor.\n\nFiercely left-wing, he campaigned against nuclear armament, and caused controversy in 2006 when, in a meeting with Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, he described US president George W Bush as \"the greatest terrorist in the world\".\n\nBelafonte also compared Bush's secretaries of state Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, both of whom were black, to slaves who worked in their master's house rather than in the fields.\n\nStatements like those made the star a frequent target of criticism, but he continued to be honoured for his artistry and humanitarian work.\n\nAmong his many awards, Belafonte was bestowed with a Kennedy Center Honor in 1989 and the National Medal of Arts in 1994. He was an EGOT - one of a rare group of people who have received all four of entertainment's biggest awards, an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.\n\nOther stars paying tribute included rapper Ice Cube, who called the star \"more than a singer, more than an actor and more than a man\".\n\nActress Mia Farrow remembered Belafonte as a \"beautiful singer,\" and \"a deeply moral and caring man\".\n\n\"If we could be more like Harry, what a wonderful world it could be,\" she added.\n\nMartin Luther King's daughter, Bernice, shared a photograph of the Belafonte at her father's funeral, and shared her personal gratitude to the star.\n\nWhen I was a child, HarryBelafonte showed up for my family in very compassionate ways,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"In fact, he paid for the babysitter for me and my siblings.

I think I can leave it at that.\"\n\nThe US decided to send cluster bombs after Ukraine warned that it was running out of ammunition during its summer counter-offensive, which has been slower and more costly than many had hoped.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the decision \"very difficult\", while its allies the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Spain opposed their use.\n\nThe vast majority sent are artillery shells with a lower than 2.35% \"dud rate\", a reference to the percentage of bomblets which do not explode immediately and can remain a threat for years.\n\nThe weapons are effective when used against troops in trenches and fortified positions, as they render large areas too dangerous to move around in until cleared.\n\nThe Ukrainian counter-offensive has been slower than many hoped\n\nRussia has used similar cluster munitions in Ukraine since it launched its full-scale invasion last year, including in civilian areas.\n\nReacting to the US decision to send the weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had similar stockpiles and they would be used \"if they are used against us\".\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian general in charge of operations in the country's east, told the BBC last week that his forces needed the weapons to \"inflict maximum damage on enemy infantry\".\n\n\"We'd like to get very fast results, but in reality it's practically impossible. The more infantry who die here, the more their relatives back in Russia will ask their government 'why?'\"\n\nHe added however that cluster munitions would not \"solve all our problems\".\n\nHe also acknowledged that their use was controversial, but added: \"If the Russians didn't use them, perhaps conscience would not allow us to do it too.\"\n\nA Russian bomblet fired in Kharkiv earlier in the war", "Okapi keeper Hannah Owens said Arabi had been \"bonding closely with mum K'tusha\"\n\nThe \"incredibly special\" birth of an okapi will help to reveal \"one of the least known and understood species on the planet\", a keeper has said.\n\nOkapis are only found in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where about 10,000 remain in the wild.\n\nChester Zoo said Arabi, a six-week-old female, had been named after a village in DRC's Okapi Wildlife Reserve.\n\nOkapi keeper Hannah Owens said it would be \"a real privilege\" to watch the \"energetic\" female calf grow.\n\nShe said the calf would become \"a vital part of the global population of her species\" and was \"already showing lots of personality\".\n\n\"Okapis are one of the least known and understood species on the planet, so every birth is incredibly special indeed,\" she said.\n\nOkapis are also called forest giraffes because of their long necks and zebra-like stripes\n\nShe said since being born, Arabi had been \"bonding closely with mum K'tusha while snuggled away in her nest\".\n\n\"Mum has been doing a fantastic job of feeding and nurturing her calf every day, and now that she has a little more confidence, Arabi decided it was time to explore the outside world.\n\n\"It didn't take long before she was confidently stretching her legs in the sunshine.\"\n\nOkapis are also called forest giraffes because of their long necks and zebra-like stripes on their hindquarters, which act as camouflage in their rainforest habitat.\n\nThe zoo said their \"shy and elusive nature\" meant the animals remained a mystery to many up until they were scientifically discovered in 1901.\n\nMs Owens said it would be \"a real privilege\" to watch the \"energetic\" female calf grow\n\nThe zoo and its partners in the DRC, where the animals are protected by law, have been working to support the last remaining populations of okapi, which is endangered in the wild.\n\nA representative said commercial logging, open-cast mining, agriculture and human settlement had resulted in the loss of the ungulate's habitat and limited access to food and water sources.\n\nThey said okapis were also hunted for meat, which is consumed locally, and their skins, which have a high value in the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nAnimal and plant director Mike Jordan said the arrival was \"not only a cause for celebration, but also a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to the conservation and protection of this charismatic species\".\n\n\"Through our continued efforts, we hope to inspire others to join us in safeguarding these remarkable creatures and their threatened habitats,\" he added.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Unexploded bomblets can linger on the ground for years and then indiscriminately detonate.\n\nMr Biden told CNN in an interview on Friday that he had spoken to allies about the decision, which was part of a military aid package worth $800m (\u00a3626m).\n\nThe president said it had taken him \"a while to be convinced to do it\", but he had acted because \"the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\".\n\nThe decision was quickly criticised by human rights groups, with Amnesty International saying cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".\n\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters the American cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine failed far less frequently than ones already being used by Russia in the conflict.\n\nBut on Saturday, some Western allies of the US refused to endorse its decision.\n\nWhen asked about his position on the US decision, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak highlighted that the UK was one of 123 countries that had signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which prohibits the production or use of the weapons and discourages their use.\n\nHis comments came ahead of a meeting with President Biden, who is due to arrive in the UK on Sunday before a Nato summit in Lithuania.\n\nThe prime minister of New Zealand - one of the countries that pushed for the convention's creation - went further than Mr Sunak, according to comments published by local media.\n\nChris Hipkins said the weapons were \"indiscriminate, they cause huge damage to innocent people, potentially, and they can have a long-lasting effect as well\".

known as a hybrid closed loop system - improved quality of life and reduced the risk of long-term health complications.\n\nAnd at the end of last year, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said the NHS should start using it.\n\nNearly 300,000 people in the UK have type 1 diabetes, including about 29,000 children.\n\nIt means their pancreas fails to produce insulin, an important hormone that helps turn food into energy.\n\nThey have to closely monitor levels of sugar, or glucose, in the blood and give themselves insulin every day of their lives, via either injections or a pump.\n\nAnd this new technology does that automatically, virtually mimicking the function of a pancreas - although it still requires information on food intake to be inputted at mealtimes to work accurately.\n\nThe new technology is intended to help prevent people with type 1 diabetes experiencing life-threatening low or high blood glucose levels, which can lead to unconsciousness and can even be fatal.\n\nAnd it also helps to improve overall blood sugar control, which means the chance of complications - like heart disease, eyesight problems and kidney disease - decreases.\n\nScotland is also offering the technology, and Wales and Northern Ireland could soon follow suit.\n\nGemma Lavery, 38, from Plymouth, who is using the device after being part of an NHS pilot scheme, says it has transformed her life.\n\n\"I no longer have to worry about work-related stress affecting my blood-glucose levels, as the closed loop helps to sort this out before it becomes a problem,\" she says.\n\n\"I can have a full night's sleep without worrying about regular low glucose levels hindering my morning routine and I have found that my diabetes is more stable.\"\n\nProf Partha Kar, NHS national speciality advisor for diabetes, said the move was \"great news for everyone with type 1 diabetes\".\n\n\"This futuristic technology not only improves medical care but also enhances the quality of life for those affected,\" he added.\n\nNHS England diabetes clinical director Dr Clare Hambling said the technology \"holds the power to redefine the lives\" of people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nShe added: \"Type 1 diabetes is an easily missed diagnosis, so if you are concerned about symptoms -

a long ban by recent standards - as well as denying him the parliamentary pass, which he would normally be entitled to as a former MP.\n\nIf he had still been an MP, the suspension could have triggered a by-election in his constituency.\n\nSpeaking during a Commons debate ahead of the vote, Mrs May said backing the report would be \"a small but important step in restoring people's trust\" in Parliament.\n\nIt was \"important to show the public that there is not one rule for them and another for us\", she said.\n\nMrs May urged her fellow MPs to vote in support of the report \"to uphold standards in public life, to show that we all recognise the responsibility we have to the people we serve, and to help to restore faith in our parliamentary democracy\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It is caused by errors in one genetic instruction within our DNA and leads to learning difficulties. It also affects growth, resulting in a large forehead and sparse hair.\n\nJessica Fisher's son, Mungo - who took part in the study - was diagnosed with the syndrome.\n\nAt the time, he was one of only two people in the world to be diagnosed with it. The other child was in Australia, but Jessica recalls that the Australian child's physical similarities to Mungo were so strong they \"could have been his sibling\".\n\nJessica subsequently started an online support group, which is now made up of 36 families from around the world, including America, Brazil, Croatia and Indonesia.\n\n\"It's devastating to learn that your child has a rare genetic disorder, but getting the diagnosis has been key to bringing us together,\" said Jessica.\n\nThe study analysed the genetic code of 13,500 families with unexplained disorders - and was able to give a diagnosis to 5,500 of them.\n\nThe results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, revealed 60 of those disorders were new conditions. Most were errors that had occurred spontaneously at conception, rather than being inherited.\n\nProf Caroline Wright, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC: \"We were able to find new genetic conditions, which means that not only people in the study benefit, but there are huge benefits to future generations.\n\n\"Getting a genetic diagnosis is hugely important to families. It allows them to speak to other families who might be affected by the same condition, and hopefully target much more personalised management and ultimately treatment.\"\n\nAround a quarter of children in the study had their treatment changed once a clear diagnosis was given.\n\nThis kind of genetic analysis is becoming more routine within NHS care.\n\nThe discovery of Turnpenny-Fry syndrome meant Dasha Brogden's daughter, Sofia, was diagnosed when she was just one month old.\n\nHer diagnosis made everyone aware heart conditions were a possibility, and a scan led to Sofia - now aged nearly three - having surgery when she was two months old.\n\nDasha, from Oxfordshire, said: \"For us, getting a diagnosis really helped us to understand what to expect.

Nine of the 10 countries with the greatest expected increases in obesity globally are low or lower-middle income states in Africa and Asia.\n\nReasons include trends in dietary preferences towards more highly processed foods, greater levels of sedentary behaviour, weaker policies to control food supply and marketing, and less well-resourced healthcare services to assist in weight management and health education.\n\nLower-income countries are \"often the least able to respond to obesity and its consequences\".\n\nThe findings estimate that rises in obesity rates around the world will have a significant impact on the global economy, equating to 3% of global Gross Domestic Product.\n\nThe report emphasises that its acknowledgement of the economic impact of obesity \"is in no way a reflection of blame on people living with obesity\".\n\nThe data published in the report will be presented to the UN on Monday.\n\nObese is a medical term used to describe a person with a high excess of body fat.\n\nThe report uses body mass index (BMI) to make its assessments.

People have had enough, he says.", "Wagner fighters on the streets of Rostov-on-Don during the mutiny\n\nA mercenary who took part in the attempted mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin says he and his fellow fighters \"didn't have a clue\" what was going on.\n\nIn the space of just 24 hours, the leader of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, staged an insurrection, sending troops into the southern city of Rostov, then further on towards Moscow.\n\nWagner fighters rarely talk to the media, but BBC Russian spoke to a junior commander who found himself in the middle of the action.\n\nGleb - not his real name - had previously been involved in the fighting for the symbolic town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. As the mutiny began, he was resting with his unit in barracks in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region.\n\nEarly in the morning on 23 June they got the call to join a column of Wagner fighters leaving Ukraine. The order came from a Wagner commander who Gleb is reluctant to name for security reasons, but who was acting on orders from Prigozhin and the Wagner Command Council.\n\n\"It's a full deployment,\" he was told. \"We're forming a column, let's move out.\"\n\nGleb says no-one was told where the column was heading, but he was surprised when he realised they were moving away from the frontline.\n\nThe Wagner fighters encountered absolutely no resistance, he says, as they crossed the Russian border into the Rostov region.\n\n\"I didn't see any border guards,\" he recalls. \"But the traffic police saluted us along the way.\"\n\nWagner says this photo shows Russian border guards at a checkpoint laying down their weapons\n\nChannels closely associated with Wagner on the messaging app Telegram later claimed that border guards at the Bugayevka checkpoint had laid down their weapons as the Wagner fighters arrived.\n\nThese channels shared a photo purportedly from the scene showing two dozen unarmed individuals in camouflage.\n\nAs they approached Rostov-on-Don, the fighters were given orders to surround all the law enforcement agency buildings in the city and to occupy the military airport. Gleb's unit was told to take control of the regional offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\nAs they approached the building it appeared to be completely locked and empty. They flew a drone overhead to check for any signs of life.\n\nEventually, after half an hour, a door opened and two people came out onto the street.\n\n\"They said, 'Guys, let's make a deal',\" Gleb recounts. \"I said, 'What's there to make a deal about? This is our city'.\n\n\"So we just agreed that we would leave each other alone. They came out to smoke from time to time.\"\n\nRostov journalists have reported a similar situation with many government buildings in and around the city. The Wagner fighters would first fly drones over them and then surround them. No-one was allowed to leave, but delivery couriers were allowed in with food.\n\nWhile all this was going on Wagner leader Prigozhin was at the Russian army's Southern Military District headquarters meeting Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Lt Gen Yunus-bek Yevkurov, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev.\n\nPrigozhin demanded that they hand over the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nA screengrab from a video which shows Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin making a speech in Rostov-on-Don on 24 June\n\nAt the same time as Prigozhin was in his meeting, there was another column of Wagner fighters on the move.\n\nGleb confirms media reports that this column was led by Wagner founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer who is rarely seen in public.\n\nThis column was on the main highway towards Voronezh, and apparently bound for Moscow, he says.\n\nSo did Gleb know the plan - what Prigozhin was intending or planning to do?\n\nHe swears as he bluntly says he didn't have a clue. \"We learned what was happening from Telegram, just like you did.\"\n\nAs the day went on, pictures of what was happening in Rostov were beamed around the world. People were surprised to see local residents and even local journalists apparently smiling and chatting to some of the normally tight-lipped Wagner fighters occupying their city.\n\n\"It was the ex-cons,\" says Gleb, referring to the many serving prisoners or convicts conscripted into Wagner last year. \"Nobody told them not to, nobody cares about them.\"\n\nFor established fighters like Gleb, who were hired long before the war in Ukraine, the rules are much more clearly understood.\n\nHe told the BBC that back in the spring, they had been told by the senior command that anyone who spoke to the media would be \"nullified\", ie killed. Several former Wagner fighters have told us the same thing.\n\nOn the evening of 24 June, Gleb was contacted by one of his superiors and told, without any explanation, that he and his unit should now return to base in Luhansk.\n\nAs they made their way back to barracks, they were following the news on Telegram.\n\nThey read that criminal charges had been initiated against Prigozhin, then dropped, and that he was to move to Belarus.\n\nThey then read that W\u0430gner fighters would not be held accountable for their role in the mutiny because of their \"combat merits\", according to President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nFor Gleb and his unit, their future is now unclear. They've been told to stay in their barracks in Luhansk and await further orders.\n\nTheir hosts, authorities of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, pro-Russian separatist militants in eastern Ukraine, are keen to find out more about their future plans and what will happen to their equipment and ammunition, he says.\n\nWhen asked why he doesn't leave Wagner, Gleb has a simple answer: \"My contract hasn't expired yet.\"", "Abdalla Hamdok served twice as Sudan PM between 2019 and 2022\n\nSudan's former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has warned that the conflict in his country could become worse than those in Syria and Libya.\n\nThe fighting between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) would be a \"nightmare for the world\" if it continued, he said.\n\nEarly on Sunday, warplanes and heavy anti-aircraft fire were heard over the capital Khartoum, residents said.\n\nThe army said it was attacking from all directions, using heavy artillery.\n\nThe fighting that started on 15 April has left hundreds dead, while tens of thousands of people are fleeing the country.\n\nThursday night's extension of an uneasy ceasefire between the rival factions followed intensive diplomatic efforts by neighbouring countries, as well as the US, UK and UN. But the 72-hour extension has not held.\n\nMeanwhile, there are chaotic scenes in Port Sudan where people are desperate to board ships, some of which are heading to Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nThe UK government said it had ended its evacuation operation. The Foreign Office said the last flight left Khartoum at 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday, and in total nearly 1,900 people were flown out.\n\nThe US government meanwhile said a US-organised convoy had reached Port Sudan to evacuate more US citizens by ship to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. It said hundreds of Americans had already left Sudan, in addition to the diplomats evacuated by air a week ago.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Mr Hamdok called for a unified international effort to persuade the Sudanese army chief and the RSF leader to hold peace talks.\n\n\"This is a huge country, very diverse ... I think it will be a nightmare for the world,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a war between an army and small rebellion. It is almost like two armies - well trained and well armed.\"\n\nMr Hamdok - who served as prime minister twice between 2019 and 2022 - added that the insecurity could become worse than the civil wars in Syria and Libya. Those wars have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, created millions of refugees and caused instability in the wider regions.\n\nTens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Sudan\n\nArmy commander Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF chief Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, disagree about the country's proposed move to civilian rule, and in particular about the timeframe of the 100,000 strong RSF's inclusion into the army.\n\nBoth factions fear losing power in Sudan, partly because on both sides there are men who could end up at the International Criminal Court for war crimes committed in the Darfur region almost 20 years ago.\n\nMillions of people remain trapped in Khartoum, where there are shortages of food, water and fuel.\n\nSudan's army has urged people in Khartoum to remain indoors and stay away from windows, as it deploys tanks and other artillery in an effort to recapture areas held by the RSF.\n\nThe RSF says the army is widening the conflict by deploying the Central Reserve police - a unit with a reputation for brutality against civilians.\n\nViolence is also reported to have been particularly bad in El Geneina, a city in Darfur in western Sudan, with claims that militia groups have looted and torched markets.\n\nHemedti has told the BBC he will not negotiate until fighting ends.\n\nHe said his fighters were being \"relentlessly\" bombed since the truce was extended.\n\n\"We don't want to destroy Sudan,\" he said, blaming army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for the violence.\n\nGen Burhan - the head of Sudan's regular army - has tentatively agreed to face-to-face talks in South Sudan.\n\nAround 2,000 people have arrived in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah\n\nAround 2,000 people have arrived in Jeddah from Port Sudan. Most are expected to be flown home via charter flights arranged by their governments within the next few days.\n\nSpeaking to BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet in Jeddah, Nazli, a 32 year-old Iranian civil engineer who fled with her fellow engineer husband, recalled the fighting they fled.\n\n\"We couldn't even sit on our balcony; the gunfire was everywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"Please please help our family in Sudan,\" cried Rasha, a Sudanese-American mother of four children - who spoke of hiding for three days, terrified.\n\n\"I call on the world to protect Sudan,\" she pleaded, underlining fears that once all the foreign nationals have fled, the fighting will intensify.\n\nAre you in Sudan?

It says a majority - nearly 700 - have joined the GMB and says that means it has met the threshold for statutory recognition.\n\nDarren Westwood, who works at the warehouse, and who has been at the forefront of getting people to join the union, says it is \"fantastic\" that recognition could be happening soon.\n\nHe said: \"It's just so exciting because we've taken on one of the biggest companies in the world and won.\"\n\nIf Amazon does not grant recognition, the body responsible for resolving recognition disputes, the Central Arbitration Committee, could be asked to step in.\n\nThe CAC could automatically grant recognition if it is persuaded that a majority of the workforce wants the union to represent them. The workforce could be required to vote to show its support for this.\n\nWorkers at the Coventry warehouse first started protesting about their pay last August - when only 30 of them were members of the GMB. They held the first ever Amazon strike in the UK in January.\n\nSince then, the company has increased its minimum starting wage to between \u00a311 and \u00a312 an hour, depending on location. The union is calling for an hourly wage of \u00a315 an hour.\n\nBut the dispute has always been about more than money.

Watch: Nigel Farage says he 'wants answers' after bank apology\n\nBanking boss Dame Alison Rose has apologised to Nigel Farage for \"deeply inappropriate\" comments made about him in a document on his suitability as a Coutts customer.\n\nThe boss of NatWest Group said in a letter to Mr Farage that the comments did not reflect the bank's view.\n\nUKIP's ex-leader has said his Coutts account was closed because the bank did not agree with his political views.\n\nMr Farage said Dame Alison should now be questioned by MPs about the issue.\n\nDame Alison's apology came after the government announced new plans to force banks to explain account closures.\n\nShe said that as well as apologising to Mr Farage, she was \"commissioning a full review of the Coutts' processes\" on bank account closures. Coutts, a private bank, is owned by the NatWest Group.\n\nIn the letter to Mr Farage she said she believed \"very strongly that freedom of expression and access to banking are fundamental to our society and it is absolutely not our policy to exit a customer on the basis of legally held political and personal views\".\n\nMr Farage had put in a request to the bank to see documents relating to the decision to close his Coutts account.\n\nThe BBC had previously reported that it had been told that Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.\n\nThe 40-page document given to Mr Farage, published by the Daily Mail, included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his suitability as a client.\n\nIt stated continuing to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts's \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".\n\nIt mentioned Mr Farage's retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations.\n\nIt gave several examples, including his comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to the Taliban, and his characterisation of the RNLI as a \"taxi-service\" for illegal immigrants, to flag concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\".\n\nOn Thursday Dame Alison also reiterated her offer to Mr Farage of alternative banking arrangements with NatWest and said she wanted to ensure they provide \"a better, more transparent experience for all our customers in the future.\"\n\nFollowing her apology, Mr Farage was asked if he thought that she should now resign.\n\n\"I think what needs to happen is the Treasury select committee needs to reconvene, come out of recess, and let's give her the opportunity to tell us the truth,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Farage also said the Telegraph had reported how the BBC's business editor Simon Jack had sat next to Dame Alison at a dinner on 3 July and the next day he had then been called by Mr Jack and told \"the reason my bank account had been closed was that I had insufficient funds in the account.\"\n\nHe said: \"I want to know, did Alison Rose breach my client confidentiality?

But to say we are over the moon is putting it mildly.\"\n\nTS Queen Mary carried thousands of passengers from Glasgow on \"doon the watter\" trips on the Clyde\n\nIn its heyday TS Queen Mary carried 13,000 passengers each week and was known as \"Britain's finest pleasure steamer\".\n\nBecause of her strong connection to Glasgow she was also affectionately known as \"The Glasgow Boat.\"\n\nThe steamer was eventually retired in 1977 and spent several years as a floating restaurant on the Thames before being towed back to the Clyde in 2016.\n\nInitially it was thought it might become a static attraction but two years ago, Princess Anne - who is Royal Patron of TS Queen Mary - announced plans to restore the ship to working order.\n\nThe steamer was named after her great-grandmother Queen Mary, who was the wife of King George V.\n\nThe late Harry Potter and Cracker actor Robbie Coltrane was an enthusiastic supporter of the restoration project, while Hollywood star Sam Neill is TS Queen Mary's \"Commonwealth Patron.\"\n\nTS Queen Mary was built in 1933 by shipbuilders William Denny in Dumbarton, for many years providing \"doon the watter\" trips from Glasgow to destinations such as Dunoon, Rothesay, Millport and Arran.\n\nIn 1935 it was renamed Queen Mary II at the request of Cunard White Star Line to release the Queen Mary name for the much larger liner that was being built at the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank.\n\u2022 None Historic steamer to sail on River Clyde once again", "The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for a 13th consecutive time later as it tries to tackle rising prices.\n\nOfficial data on Wednesday showed that inflation, the annual rate at which prices go up, was stuck at 8.7% in May.\n\nThat has made it more likely for the Bank to announce a rise in its benchmark rate from 4.5%.\n\nInterest rates remain its primary tool to lower inflation, despite debate over its effectiveness.\n\nAnalysts say an increase to 4.75% is most likely, but a bigger increase to 5% remains a possibility, although one economist suggested such a rise could suggest the Bank has \"completely lost control of inflation\".\n\nAny such change would mean further pain for some homeowners, but it could benefit savers.\n\nThe Bank rate is already at its highest level for about 15 years, rising consistently since December 2021 in response to the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe theory is that raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, meaning people have less to spend, and so bringing down demand and therefore easing price rises.\n\nA further rise is expected to be confirmed at 12:00 BST on Thursday after a meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, which makes the decision independently of government.\n\nSir Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England for monetary policy, told the BBC's Today programme that if he were on the committee he would \"probably\" vote for a 0.5% hike.\n\n\"The news since the last meeting has been unambiguously bad on an inflation front,\" he said. \"You've had two bad inflation releases and also the labour market release showed pay growth much stronger than they would have expected - you put all of that together and it's a pretty clear signal it needs further rate increases.\"\n\nSir Charlie said the question for the Bank was whether they wanted to do a \"big step today, or a smaller step, but maybe indicating there will be more [rate rises] in the pipeline\".\n\nHow are interest rate rises affecting you?\n\nLuke Hickmore, investment director at Abrdn, told the BBC there was a \"large risk\" of a 0.5% rise, but added that if the Bank did that it \"may give the wrong message to the markets that it has completely lost control of inflation\".\n\nIn a speech he is due to give shortly after the decision is announced, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will recommit to halving inflation by the end of the year and say he feels a \"deep moral responsibility to make sure the money you earn holds its value\".\n\nHe is expected to tell a business event in south east England that he is \"completely confident that if we hold our nerve\" the target can be hit.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised the government over the impact of rising rates on people with mortgages.\n\nAhead of the rate decision, she said: \"Instead of squabbling over peerages and parties and ruling out any action on mortgages, the Tories should be taking responsibility and acting now.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics said that inflation was unchanged on the previous month at 8.7%. That was met with surprise by analysts who had expected it to fall.\n\nThe shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.\n\nSo-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month at its fastest rate for 31 years.\n\nEconomists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy\".\n\nThe government's target is to halve the inflation rate to 5% by the end of the year. The official, long-term target set for the Bank is 2%.\n\nRob Morgan, from investment firm Charles Stanley, said: \"Getting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.\n\n\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"\n\nWhen interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments.\n\nThe increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.\n\nThis comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.\n\nIf the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.\n\nEight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage. Their monthly payments may not change immediately, but house buyers or anyone seeking to remortgage face a sharp rise in repayments when they move on to a new deal.\n\nThe so-called \"mortgage bomb\" has become a huge economic and political issue. An average two-year fixed deal, which was 2.29% in November 2021, is now above 6%.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a politically independent economics-focused think tank, says rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable incomes fall by more than 20%.\n\nRenters are also feeling the impact. \"It is likely that at least part of the increases in rents we are seeing is due to high interest rates hitting landlords' borrowing costs,\" the IFS said.\n\nRents have been growing faster than wages in the UK for nearly two years, according to exclusive data given to the BBC by property portal Zoopla.\n\nMeanwhile, savers should benefit from a rise in interest rates, but MPs on the Treasury Committee have criticised banks and building societies for failing to pass this on in full to loyal savers who have instant-access savings accounts.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Dominic Raab arrived to meet me in his constituency in Surrey, the trappings of office gone.\n\nNo ministerial car, no aides, no title, beyond backbench Conservative MP.\n\nThere was little in the way of contrition, although he did say he would apologise to anyone who he described as having \"subjective hurt feelings.\"\n\nThree very striking words - striking, as they do, at the very essence of this whole affair.\n\nHow the behaviour of someone feels to someone else.\n\nIt is in the eye, the mind, the stomach of the beholder.\n\nRemember, complainants across three government departments thought his behaviour was unacceptable - and sufficiently so to provide testimony to this inquiry.\n\nThe report, in the round, is complex, caveated and nuanced.\n\nIn our conversation, Mr Raab sought to defend, to justify his manner and conduct - and, moreover, argue his experience was an important case study in what he saw as the failures of the relationship between that engine room of government, a civil service duty bound to be impartial, and its political masters.\n\nMr Raab's description of some civil servants as \"activist\" is, in this context, explosive.\n\nSufficiently so, some civil servants see it as a conspiracy concocted to distract attention from the criticisms he's faced.\n\nHis account, too, will provoke a wider national conversation - about what is appropriate behaviour at work in 2023.\n\nAnd from the national to the local: one intriguing titbit in the interview was Dominic Raab repeatedly refusing to say if he will stand at the next election in Esher and Walton, the seat he has represented since 2010.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are desperate to snatch the seat from him.\n\nIt is one constituency in what one party strategist described to me as a \"yellow halo\" of spots around London that the Lib Dems see as potential gains at the next general election.\n\nParty leader Sir Ed Davey was there in the patch in the blink of an eye to make that case.\n\nBack at Westminster, curiously, the prime minister - on the day he lost his long-standing ally and deputy - hasn't managed to find any of our cameras.\n\nWould Rishi Sunak have sacked him?\n\nDoes he agree with Mr Raab's analysis?\n\nI am told the prime minister had a busy diary, not least being caught up in meetings relating to the fighting in Sudan.\n\nAvoiding questions now won't mean they disappear.\n\nThe day a prime minister loses their number two is a bad day in Downing Street.\n\nBut Mr Sunak is inoculated - to a degree - from outright Conservative insurrection, after the party's recent flirtation with oblivion last autumn.\n\nPlenty of Conservatives are not surprised that after all of this Dominic Raab is out of government.

Some of them carry rocks or small home-made bombs to hurl at passing Israeli vehicles. In sporadic bursts, gunfire and explosions echo in the refugee camp, which is on high ground above the town centre. Israeli drones buzz constantly overhead.\n\nAt times, armed Palestinians emerge from the tyre smoke to fire at the Israelis.\n\nViolence between Palestinians and Israelis has become almost a daily event this year. When blood is spilt there is often a dynamic of retaliation, that includes Palestinian armed groups, Jews who live in settlements in the occupied West Bank that are illegal under international law, and the Israeli army. The Israelis said they moved in on the Jenin camp because more than 50 relatively recent attacks were launched from there.\n\nBut the roots of violence, despair and hatred go much deeper than the latest violent confrontations. They thrive in the poison generated by a conflict over possession of the land that started more than a century ago. For a while, back in the 1990s, there were hopes that peace might come if an independent Palestinian state could be established alongside Israel, the so-called two-state solution. The attempt failed.\n\nPowerful Western countries, including the US, European Union members and the UK still insist that two states are the only possible solution. Their words are empty slogans. The last American attempt to try to make the idea work collapsed in 2014.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Israeli operation here in Jenin was in the air for months. Despite regular smaller Israeli raids, Palestinian armed groups had become strong enough and united enough to control the Jenin refugee camp. They seemed to be getting stronger.\n\nA fortnight ago they blew up an Israeli jeep and fought hard to repel an Israeli raid, in which the Palestinian dead included a 15-year-old girl. The next day four Israelis were killed by two Palestinians who burst into a restaurant not far from Jenin, where they were eating. The Israeli army protected Jewish settlers who rampaged through Palestinian villages burning cars and houses, in a series of reprisals.\n\nIt was a matter of time before the Israeli army moved against the Palestinians who controlled Jenin refugee camp. It says it is carrying out a systematic operation to track down and destroy weapons and explosives.\n\nFury and frustration rage through young Palestinian men who have gathered in angry knots at road junctions in the town and outside a hospital on the edge of the Jenin refugee camp. Their barricades of burning tyres leave behind black circles and piles of burnt rubber and twisted wire.\n\nThe Israeli army is releasing updates on explosives discovered and neutralised in the two days it has been in the camp, along with what it calls terrorist command centres. The business-like tone of the military communiques contrasts with the statements made by members of the Israeli cabinet who oppose any kind of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nAfter a Palestinian was shot dead in Tel Aviv by a passer-by, after he had rammed his car into a crowd of Israelis, public security minister Itamar Ben Gvir issued a statement saying Israel's war in Jenin was also their war in Tel Aviv. Every Jew, he said, was a target for murderers.\n\nMr Ben Gvir and his political allies have been pressing for a punitive sweep through the West Bank to deal with their enemies. The Israeli army is more cautious, as it is more worried about the risks and consequences of escalation. All the indications are the Israeli army would like to restrict its operation to the Jenin refugee camp, declare victory soon and order its soldiers back to their bases.\n\nIsraeli victories after an operation like this never last long. Palestinian armed groups restock their armouries and the cycle begins again. Plans to expand settlements for Jews on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state, sometimes called a Zionist response by Israeli politicians, also raise the temperature.\n\nMany Palestinians are disenchanted with their own ageing and ineffective leaders in the Palestinian Authority, a legacy of the 1990s peace process that was supposed back then to build the institutions necessary to create their own state.\n\nWhen this operation ends, on past form both sides will claim victory. Then the current realities of this long conflict will reassert themselves. Anger, despair and poverty will reinforce the culture of resistance that has embedded itself in Palestinian society, especially here in Jenin and in Nablus. And Israel's right-wing, hyper-nationalist government, as long as it lasts, will try to match its rhetoric with action.\n\nThe real danger is that Israelis and Palestinians are sliding into an even more violent phase of their long conflict.", "Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched again in nationwide protests against the government's plan to curb Supreme Court powers.\n\nThis is the 11th week of mass demonstrations, as opponents of the reforms accuse right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining judicial independence.\n\nMr Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, says his aim is to restore a balance of power between the government and Israel's top court.\n\nThe escalating protests have impacted on the economy and prompted a threat by some military reservists to defy call-up orders.", "Twitter has lost almost half of its advertising revenue since it was bought by Elon Musk for $44bn (\u00a333.6bn) last October, its owner has revealed.\n\nHe said the company had not seen the increase in sales that had been expected in June, but added that July was a \"bit more promising\".\n\nMr Musk sacked about half of Twitter's 7,500 staff when he took over in 2022 in an effort to cut costs.\n\nRival app Threads now has 150 million users, according to some estimates.\n\nIts in-built connection to Instagram automatically gives the Meta-designed platform access to a potential two billion users.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter is struggling under a heavy debt load.

Jurgen Klopp's side have won their past seven games to bolster their push for a top-four finish and now lie a point behind Newcastle and Manchester United, albeit having played a game more. Another dismal loss for Leicester leaves the 2016 Premier League champions firmly rooted in danger in 19th position, two points adrift of safety with only two games remaining. The Reds scored twice in the space of three first-half minutes through the same combination, Mohamed Salah twice feeding Jones who finished confidently to claim his first Premier League double. It should have been 3-0 before half-time but home goalkeeper Daniel Iversen made a superb reaction save to deny Cody Gakpo from close range. Salah claimed his third assist in the second period by laying off a free-kick for Trent Alexander-Arnold to curl a sublime finish into the top corner.\n\u2022 None 'That's the end of them' - Leicester look 'gone' after Liverpool loss Has Liverpool's charge for a Champions League spot come too late? The two Uniteds above them need two wins from their last three games to guarantee a top-four finish but Liverpool are right on their tails and poised to profit from any mishaps. The Reds started slowly at Leicester, Luis Diaz smashing into the side-netting and Fabinho blazing over the pick of their early openings. But they clicked into gear on the half-hour mark as midfielder Jones took his tally to three goals in his last four games. His first was a controlled finish at the far post from Salah's deep cross and the second he thumped home following the Egyptian's through ball. Salah provided a hat-trick of assists by rolling the ball off for Alexander-Arnold's stunning second-half strike, but the Egyptian must wait for his 20th goal of the campaign after a remarkable miss late on, putting wide when through on goal. Liverpool face European-chasing Aston Villa at home on Saturday and round off their season against relegated Southampton knowing maximum points in those games may complete a stunning turnaround in an otherwise disappointing season. Leicester look doomed and are prime candidates to join Southampton in the Championship next season. The Foxes have collected just one win in their last 14 games - earning six points in total during that run - and lost at home for a club-record equalling 10th time this season. Their frailties lie at the back where boss Dean Smith made another change by giving a start and handing the captain's armband to Jonny Evans, who has played one minute of top-flight football in the last seven months. But it was ill-fated defensive partner Wout Faes - the scorer of two own goals in December's reverse fixture - who was culpable for both of Jones' strikes. The Belgian lost the flight of the ball for the first, failing to clear as the it dropped from the sky, and was caught out of position for the second, running out to intercept a pass without success. The hosts had shown bright sparks early on but their confidence ebbed away alarmingly once they conceded. Harvey Barnes forced Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson into a fine flying save with a curling effort in the second half, but the sorry home side never looked like making a comeback.

The witness had been incredibly courageous, says Det Supt Mark Baker\n\nSenior prosecutor Maria Corr said Cashman had used two guns while shooting at his intended target Joseph Nee.\n\n\"In the community, people [were] afraid of coming forward - because would their child be next?,\" she said.\n\n\"The privacy and safety of your own home - this ruthless killer didn't care. He shot a little nine-year-old child.\"\n\nIn an interview with BBC News, Ms Corr said Cashman's actions begged the question: \"If someone is like that, would you come forward?\n\n\"Thankfully, we had a witness who had the courage of her convictions and wanted justice and she was very, very, brave.\"\n\nMs Corr said that when she assessed the woman's interview with detectives, she found her words to be \"powerful, strong and the bottom line was she was telling the truth\".\n\nShe explained: \"We had all the independent evidence that corroborated her account - the tracksuit bottoms, the [gunshot residue] on those tracksuit bottoms, the T-shirt, the telephone call to her partner who then came, then we saw him [dropping] Thomas Cashman off.\n\n\"Then we had that little clip of CCTV of [a man] then taking what she said was the bag with murder clothes in it to somebody else.\"\n\nMs Corr added: \"She was telling the truth - and it was at that moment I thought, 'Yes, the officers had done enough for me to make my charging decision'.\"\n\nThe witness was strong, powerful and told the truth, senior prosecutor Maria Corr said\n\nDet Supt Baker agreed the witness had been incredibly courageous, especially given \"the levels of fear in the community\".\n\nEven though he said officers had obtained 320 pieces of CCTV footage - sometimes only seized following court orders - the senior investigating officer said: \"Without witnesses there is no justice.\"\n\nIt was \"probably the bravest thing that I've seen in my career in terms of coming forward and providing evidence in court\", he added.\n\nDet Supt Baker also said that while there had been a \u00a3200,000 reward offered to anybody providing evidence leading to the conviction of Olivia's killer, the witness had not made a claim.\n\n\"During the course of the trial... there was an allegation that she was financially driven,\" he said.\n\n\"She came to us on 24 August - two days after the murder - before any reward was even offered. She wasn't financially driven.\n\n\"She explained herself in open court what her motive was, and she's done it for all the right reasons.\n\n\"Because a line had been drawn in the sand in respect of the shooting of a nine-year-old girl in her own house.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Draw your own conclusions.\"\n\nIn response to the letter to the FCA, Mr Farage tweeted he was \"delighted that the Chancellor and City Minister are putting pressure on the FCA to review why banks are giving UK PEPs such a hard time\".\n\n\"Even better would be to change the law. It is an EU directive and a Brexit government ought to deal with it,\" he added.\n\nThe Treasury has previously said it would be a \"serious concern\" if financial services were being denied to those exercising their right to lawful free speech.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We are already looking into this issue and have passed a law that requires the Financial Conduct Authority to review how banks treat politically exposed persons - so we can strike the right balance between the customer's right to free speech and the bank's right to manage commercial risk.\"", "Spanish maritime rescuers have spent days looking for the small Senegalese boat (file image)\n\nThe Spanish coast guard has rescued 86 people from a migrant boat off the coast of the Canary Islands.\n\nAt first, rescuers thought they had found one of three boats that have been missing since they left Senegal more than two weeks ago.\n\nBut the coast guard now says this boat is a different vessel that they did not know about, according to migrant aid group, Walking Borders.\n\nIt means there are still more than 300 people missing at sea, on three boats.\n\nThe fourth vessel was spotted by a search plane on Monday afternoon, with maritime rescuers initially reporting that they could see 200 people on board.\n\nThe boat was found 70 nautical miles (130km) south-west of the Canary Islands. It was carrying people from sub-Saharan Africa, however where it departed from was unclear, a coast guard spokesperson told Reuters news agency.\n\nThose rescued include 80 men and six women, and with the assistance of a container ship, the boat was taken towards Gran Canaria island.\n\nMeanwhile, the search continues for the three missing vessels - the largest of which had an estimated 200 people on board, including many children.\n\nIt is thought to have left Senegal more than two weeks ago, on 27 June, heading for the Canary Islands, Walking Borders said.\n\nThe boat sailed from Kafountine, a coastal town that is roughly 1,700km (1,056 miles) from Tenerife.\n\nThe other two boats are slightly smaller and left four days earlier. One has about 65 people on board and the other up to 60.\n\nThis comes just weeks after an overcrowded trawler sank off the Greek coast, in one of the worst Mediterranean migrant shipwrecks.\n\nAt least 78 people were confirmed drowned, but the UN reported that up to 500 were still missing.\n\nThe voyage from West Africa to the Canary Islands is among the most dangerous routes for migrants. They usually sail in dugout fishing boats that are easily tossed by powerful Atlantic currents.\n\nLast year at least 559 people died at sea attempting to reach the Spanish islands, the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says. The death toll for 2021 was 1,126.\n\nHowever, the IOM says information about the number of departures from West Africa is scarce and shipwrecks are often not reported.\n\nIt adds that the migrants are often from Morocco, Mali, Senegal, Ivory Coast, or are of other sub-Saharan origins.\n\nAccording to Spain's interior ministry, 15,682 people arrived in the Canary Islands without permission in 2022, a drop of more than 30% compared with 2021.\n\n\"Despite the year-to-year decrease, flows along this dangerous route since 2020 remain high compared to prior years,\" the IOM says.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nGary Lineker will return to present Match of the Day after he was taken off air amid an impartiality row following his criticism of the government's new asylum policy.\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie said an independent review of BBC social media guidelines would be carried out - and denied the BBC had backed down.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"it was right\" the matter had been resolved.\n\nBut on Monday the BBC continued to face criticism from a range of sides.\n\nLineker said he supported the review and looked forward to getting back on air, describing the last few days as \"surreal\" and thanking people for their \"incredible support\".\n\nBut Tory backbench MP Philip Davies told the Mail Online the BBC's decision was a \"pathetic capitulation\" to Lineker and the \"start of the end for the licence fee\", while ex-cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg also warned the \"licence fee has passed its sell-by date\".\n\nLabour's shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, meanwhile, said the return of Lineker was welcome, but \"much bigger questions remain about the impartiality and independence of the BBC from government pressures\".\n\nFormer BBC director-general Greg Dyke compared the row to \"like a 5-0\" win for Lineker and said he thought there was a public perception the government had bullied the broadcaster into removing the TV star, which was \"very bad news\" for the BBC.\n\nEx-BBC News executive Sir Craig Oliver, who went on to be a Downing Street communications chief under then-Prime Minister David Cameron, described the situation as \"a total mess\" and said it was the \"wrong choice\" to have asked Lineker to step back in the first place.\n\n\"The reality is the BBC today has announced it will have a review of its social media guidelines,\" he told the BBC. \"In fact, it needs a review of how it handles crisis like these.\"\n\nSir Michael Lyons, a former BBC chairman under Labour, told BBC Newsnight: \"It simply isn't possible for the BBC to be a champion of dissent in Russia and Hong Kong, and at the same time not leave space for dissent in this country.\"\n\nHe added there was \"a big question about consistency in the way rules are applied\" saying some BBC stars have been allowed to say things about the Labour Party, referring to a tweet by Lord Alan Sugar advising people not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nFormer controller of BBC editorial policy Richard Ayre said rewriting guidelines was not straightforward and was \"going to be a nightmare\".\n\n\"Whatever emerges will be unsatisfactory to a significant number of people.

It triggered an unprecedented wave of walkouts from fellow pundits and commentators in solidarity with Lineker, which disrupted weekend football coverage across the BBC.\n\nSports presenter Mark Chapman - who did not present BBC Radio 5 Live's Saturday Coverage or Match of the Day 2 on Sunday on TV - returned to football radio show The Monday Night Club and apologised for the lack of service over the weekend.\n\nHe said it had been \"miserable and difficult\" for the staff involved and it was \"disgusting and unfair\" that the staff who did work on the weekend received abuse.\n\nHe added: \"It is ironic in a row over impartiality we have all been seen to be taking sides, and I feel there are lessons to be learned by all involved.\"\n\nBBC Scotland also had full coverage of Monday evening's Scottish cup tie between Falkirk and Ayr United after its programming was also limited over the weekend.\n\nAfter his return to BBC TV was announced, Lineker tweeted: \"However difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away.\n\n\"It's heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you.

Balwani ultimately exhausted his options and reported to a federal prison in San Pedro, California, earlier this month to begin his nearly 13-year sentence.\n\nIf Holmes' appeal is unsuccessful, the US District Court of California has recommended the mother of two serve her time at a federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, that allows for family visitation.

The document will be on display for its 703rd anniversary.\n\nOne of the most famous documents in Scottish history has gone on display for the first time in 18 years.\n\nThe Declaration of Arbroath was written on 6 April 1320 by Scottish nobles asking the Pope to acknowledge Scottish independence.\n\nThe fragile text can only occasionally be shown in public to ensure its condition is preserved.\n\nIt will be on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh until 2 July.\n\nThe letter was one of three written to Pope John XXII, who refused to recognise King Robert I - Robert the Bruce - as the monarch in Scotland.\n\nThe King and the Bishop of St Andrews also wrote to the Pope, but the barons' letter is the only surviving document.\n\nTheir collective plea was unsuccessful as the Pope's reply urged reconciliation with the English.\n\nThe two countries had been fighting against each other in the Wars of Scottish Independence since the English invasion of Scotland in 1296, with Robert the Bruce leading the Scottish army to a famous victory in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.\n\nThe first war of independence eventually ended with a peace treaty in 1328, but a second war erupted four years later and continued for 25 years.\n\nHazel de Vere and Eva Martinez Moya work on preserving the letter\n\nDr Alan Borthwick, head of medieval and early modern records at the National Records of Scotland (NRS) said the declaration helps people understand the political feeling at the time.\n\nHe said: \"It encapsulates an awful lot about what the Scots thought about themselves as a nation in 1320 and their rights to be an independent kingdom, not subject to the English king.\n\n\"The way that it is written, using quotes from the Bible but also classical authors - it's a very, very carefully crafted text.\n\n\"It is strongly asserting their position as supporters of Robert the First as their king without having to get an approval from the king of England.\"\n\nThe Declaration was written in Latin and was sealed by eight earls and about 40 barons.\n\nOne of the most famous quotes of the roughly 1,000-word long text still inspires the Scottish independence movement 700 years later.\n\nDr Alan Borthwick at the Declaration of Arbroath display\n\nIt reads: \"As long as a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be subjected to the lordship of the English.\n\n\"It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.\"\n\nDr Borthwick said: \"There are a number ways in which you can interpret the text.\n\n\"There is the context in which it was produced, and for some undoubtedly it is the context that it may have in more modern times.\n\n\"It's phrases like that which undoubtedly resonate across the generations and across the centuries and across the world. When you think of people fighting for freedom, that is really what it's about.\"\n\nSome historians claim its significance has been overstated and the purpose of the declaration was simply to shore up the reign of the Scottish king.\n\nThe Declaration of Arbroath display has been organised in partnership between National Museums Scotland and NRS, who keep the document.\n\nThe letter is usually kept in a temperature-controlled secure location with limited access and no light.\n\nIt is vulnerable to degradation as it is made from sheep skin, and moving the document for display is a very complex process.\n\nLinda Ramsay, who heads up conservation at the NRS, has worked on preserving the Declaration of Arbroath since 1991.\n\n\"It is a great privilege to be so close to these real history-making documents,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a totemic document, certainly for a Scot. It has a lot of challenges but it is a real privilege.\n\n\"With display there are so many vulnerabilities and so many factors that we are not in total control of.\"\n\nShe said she feels nervous when the document leaves the managed space, adding: \"We like it to be back sleeping in its bed in the store secure.\n\n\"We're pleased that people are going to see the Declaration. A public record is something you can't just keep and nobody sees it, there is an interest and quite rightly we have to make that possible.\"\n\nWe were given rare access to film the Declaration of Arbroath ahead of it going on display.\n\nIn a room where both the temperature and humidity were tightly controlled, we watched as expert conservators from the NRS inspected the document, looking for and recording any signs of deterioration in its condition.\n\nThey explained to me that a visual examination is carried out any time a significant document goes on display.\n\nThe 700-year-old letter is normally kept in a case in a darkened room. We weren't allowed to use artificial lights with our camera when we filmed and instead relied on daylight from the huge windows in the north-facing room to illuminate the medieval writing and seals.\n\nThere was also UV laminate on the window panes to reduce any potential damage from sun light.\n\nThe cupboards in the lab-like room held vellum and dyes and more exotic sounding material such as Goldbeater's skin. Linda Ramsay, head of conservation at the NRS, said their aim was to slow down degradation and preserve the Declaration of Arbroath in the best state they can for future generations.\n\nWe took an immense amount of care while filming and moving around the 14 Century priceless, fragile document.

Watch Nomia Iqbal's interview in full: Tim Davie is asked whether he has lost control of the BBC\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie has apologised to licence fee payers after a day of sports programme disruption.\n\nFootball shows were pulled at the last minute on Saturday after presenters and commentators walked out in support of Match of the Day host Gary Lineker.\n\nMatch of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition.\n\nLineker was suspended after criticising the government's controversial asylum policy. But Mr Davie denied the government pressured him into the move.\n\nAs well as having no presenter, Match of the Day on BBC One on Saturday night was broadcast without commentary, and pundits Alan Shearer and Ian Wright did not appear.\n\nThe programme was also without its famous theme tune and opening credits. The show started with a graphic reading \"Premier League Highlights\" before launching straight into clips from the Bournemouth v Liverpool game - the usual commentary replaced by the sound of the crowd.\n\nMr Davie admitted it had been a \"difficult day\" for the corporation but said \"we are working very hard to resolve the situation\".\n\nInterviewed by BBC News, Mr Davie said \"success for me is getting Gary back on air and together we are giving to the audiences that world-class sports coverage which, as I say, I'm sorry we haven't been able to deliver today\".\n\nThe director general said he would \"absolutely not\" be resigning but admitted \"this has been a tough time for the BBC\".\n\nHe said there had been no \"pandering\" to any political party amid accusations from opposition parties that BBC executives had bowed to pressure from Downing Street and ministers over the anti-government tweet.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. How the row played out on Saturday... in 60 seconds\n\nMr Davie said Lineker had been asked to \"step back\" after getting \"involved in party political matters\". He added he was prepared to review impartiality rules for freelance staff like Lineker.\n\nIn the Sunday Mirror, Lineker's son, George, is quoted as saying he thought his father would return to presenting Match of the Day. However, George said \"he [Lineker] won't ever back down on his word\".\n\nCommenting on the Illegal Migration Bill on Tuesday, Lineker called it an \"immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".\n\nHis suspension on Friday triggered a wider debate about BBC impartiality, the government's asylum policy and the position of the broadcaster's chairman Richard Sharp.\n\nIt also led to an unprecedented day of turmoil for the BBC's sport operation, with staff including some of the most recognisable faces and voices associated with its football coverage downing tools.\n\nOn a day which should have featured morning to evening football programming on TV and radio, the BBC was forced to air re-runs of programmes or play podcasts on Radio 5 Live to plug gaps in the schedule.\n\nFootball Focus was due to air at noon but was pulled when host Alex Scott tweeted it \"doesn't feel right going ahead with the show today\" an hour-and-a-half before it was due to start.\n\nFinal Score was axed from the 16:00 slot when host Jason Mohammad told the BBC he was refusing to present.\n\nRadio 5 Live's regular Saturday morning show Fighting Talk was cancelled when staff boycotted, a decision host Colin Murray said was \"taken by the entire... team and myself\".\n\nFans tuning in to follow the afternoon's action on TV were met with re-runs of Bargain Hunt and The Repair Shop. At one point, 5 Live resorted to replaying old pre-recorded material.\n\nBefore Match of the Day aired on BBC One at 22:20, a continuity presenter told viewers: \"We're sorry we're unable to show our normal Match of the Day, including commentary tonight, but here now is the best action from today's Premier League matches.\"\n\nThere are major questions surrounding Sunday's planned coverage and whether the BBC can get Match of the Day 2 with Mark Chapman onto TV screens. The host was absent from the airwaves on Saturday.\n\nPrime minister Rishi Sunak called Lineker a \"talented presenter\" in a statement on Saturday evening, but added the row was not a matter for the government.\n\nHe said: \"As prime minister, I have to do what I believe is right, respecting that not everyone will always agree. That is why I have been unequivocal in my approach to stopping the boats.\n\n\"Gary Lineker was a great footballer and is a talented presenter. I hope that the current situation between Gary Lineker and the BBC can be resolved in a timely manner, but it is rightly a matter for them, not the government.\"\n\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said \"individual cases are a matter for the BBC,\" but Downing Street and several senior ministers have been vocally critical in recent days.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman and Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer have both attacked the presenter for implying a comparison between the government's language and Nazi Germany.\n\nMs Braverman said the Nazi comparison used by Lineker was \"lazy and unhelpful\".\n\nSenior Labour politicians have expressed support for Lineker, including leader Sir Keir Starmer. He said the government should focus on fixing the asylum system rather than \"whingeing on\" about Lineker and accused BBC bosses of bowing to pressure from ministers.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for BBC chairman Richard Sharp to stand down, saying the row exposed \"failings at the top\" of the corporation.\n\n\"We need leadership at the BBC that upholds our proud British values and can withstand today's consistently turbulent politics and Conservative bullying tactics,\" he added.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Greg Dyke, who acted as director general between 2000 and 2004, said the BBC had \"undermined its own credibility\" over its handling of the row.\n\nHe pointed to the ongoing controversy surrounding Mr Sharp, adding the Lineker move could create the impression the \"BBC has bowed to government pressure\".\n\nAn ongoing KC-led review into Mr Sharp's appointment as BBC chairman is investigating whether he failed to properly disclose details of his involvement in the facilitation of an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee for the then PM Boris Johnson. He has denied any involvement in the arrangement of a loan for Mr Johnson.\n\nThe BBC is also conducting its own internal review over any potential conflicts of interest Mr Sharp may have in his current role as BBC chairman.\n\nFormer head of BBC TV News and director of sport, Roger Mosey, also called for Mr Sharp to go and said the chairman had \"damaged the BBC's credibility\".\n\nHowever, others have been more supportive of the BBC's actions. Richard Ayre, former controller of editorial policy at the corporation, said on Friday the BBC had \"no choice\" but to take action against Lineker.\n\nHe said the BBC's director general Tim Davie had \"clearly tried\" to reach an agreement with Lineker but failed, adding: \"It's inevitable now that having in effect not sacked him but removed him temporarily at least, the BBC will now come under a torrent of criticism saying it's acting under the government's behest.\"\n\nLineker has hosted Match of the Day since 1999 and is the BBC's highest paid star, having earned about \u00a31.35m in 2020-21.

He was given a 17-month ban.\n\nThe 63-year-old's extended suspension is the longest ban issued to someone in English football for discrimination.\n\nThe FA appealed against the sanction on the basis it was \"insufficient\".\n\nA report from the disciplinary commission had said comments made by Yems were \"not a case of conscious racism\", which the FA said it \"fundamentally disagreed\" with.\n\nThe appeal board upheld the FA's claim with a subsequent three-year ban issued until January 2026.\n\n\"We welcome the verdict from the independent appeal board to suspend John Yems from all football-related activity until January 2026,\" an FA spokesperson said.\n\n\"We strongly disagreed with their original sanction, as well as some of the elements of their judgement, which we fundamentally believed were not appropriate for the severity of the offences committed by John Yems.\n\n\"We are pleased that the independent appeal board ruled that specific findings from the Independent Regulatory Commission were unreasonable, as there were numerous examples of inherent and obvious racist language.\n\n\"This is a deeply distressing case for the victims involved, and we hope that the outcome of this appeal will help to bring some closure. We also hope that this will encourage anyone who has experienced or witnessed discrimination in the game to report it.\"\n\nYems was suspended by Crawley on 23 April last year amid accusations that he had used discriminatory language and behaviour towards his players between 2019 and 2022.\n\nHe parted with the League Two club 13 days later, days after the FA announced its investigation.\n\nYems admitted one charge of making comments that had a reference to either ethnic origin, race, nationality, religion, gender or colour but denied 15 others against him.\n\nThe independent regulatory commission, which held a hearing in November, found 11 of the charges to be proven and four unproven.\n\nIn his defence, Yems had \"categorically denied that he was in any way racist\" the tribunal's report stated.\n\nFormer Nottingham Forest striker Jason Lee, now a senior executive at the Professional Footballers' Association, said the original findings \"essentially excused Yems\".\n\n\"Despite the ban given to John Yems following the original hearing, the subsequent written findings essentially excused his language and behaviour as 'unconscious racism',\" Lee said.\n\n\"Not only was this unnecessary, it was also dangerous.\n\n\"It sends a message that those in positions of authority can justify their behaviour if they claim not to understand its impact.\n\n\"That should never be accepted. It's the job of everyone in the game, but particularly those in positions of power, to take responsibility for making sure they are educated.\n\n\"It shouldn't continue to be the job of those who are victims of racism and discrimination to adapt to an environment where it is passed off as banter or joking behaviour.\n\n\"We now need to make sure those excuses are removed.

At least one estimate suggests the run could gross almost \u00a32bn by the time it ends in September.\n\nSearches for accommodations in cities on the tour shot up after it was announced, Airbnb reported. Tickets for many concerts sold out within days and prices soared on the resale market.\n\nIn the UK, 60,000 people descended on Cardiff, including fans from Lebanon, the US and Australia. Demand for hotel rooms tied to her concert in London was so strong that in one case, some homeless families being housed in a hotel by the local council were reportedly booted to make way for her fans.\n\nThe Stockholm concerts, where Beyonc\u00e9 played to a crowd of 46,000 for two nights, reportedly drew fans from around the world - especially the US, where a strong dollar against the krona helped to make tickets in the Nordic country seem a relative steal.\n\nIn an email to the Washington Post last month, Visit Stockholm described the boom in tourism to the city as the \"Beyonc\u00e9 effect\" .\n\nInflation in Sweden peaked at 12.3% in December. The 9.7% rate last month was down from 10.5% in April, official figures show. Financial markets had expected around 9.4%.\n\nFor one star to have such an impact is \"very rare\", Mr Grahn told the BBC, adding that big soccer tournaments can have a similar effect.\n\nHe wrote on social media that he expected trends to return to normal in June.", "James Martin, pictured in 2021, described late 2017 as \"one of the most fraught and difficult periods of my life\"\n\nTV chef James Martin has revealed he was diagnosed with facial cancer several years ago.\n\nIt follows reports the presenter was asked to change his behaviour at work after ITV received complaints about his treatment of production staff.\n\nIn a series of tweets, he described the end of 2017 as \"one of the most fraught and difficult periods of my life\".\n\nHe added he would like to \"apologise to the crew involved in this incident, as I did at the time.\"\n\nDuring the production of James Martin's Saturday Morning in 2018, the star became angry after a drain was blocked at his home, where the programme was being filmed.\n\nIn a joint statement earlier this week, the 51-year-old and production company Blue Marlin - which took responsibility for the damage - said they \"agree lessons have been learned\".\n\nIn a new statement posted on Twitter, Martin explained that around the time of the drain incident, he received his cancer diagnosis, which he added \"has returned on several occasions\" following surgery, requiring \"regular treatments\".\n\nHe had also been dealing with his grandfather's death and a home burglary.\n\n\"After all this stress I was in a very emotional state, and when after filming in early January 2018 I discovered my home had been flooded while filming, I was extremely upset,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I can only say I am human and following a build-up of personal life pressure.\"\n\nHe added: \"I admit that I overreacted regarding the damage to my home.\"\n\nReports of his mistreatment of production staff came to light earlier this week after a fresh complaint was made to ITV regarding his behaviour on another recent show.\n\nMartin has been \"accused of berating people\" and \"reducing them to tears in front of other colleagues\", according to US publication Deadline, while filming the Spanish Adventure programme in May.\n\nAn ITV spokesman previously said \"people and their welfare\" was their \"highest priority\".\n\n\"Following a complaint we received in May from members of the Blue Marlin production team about the filming of James Martin's Spanish Adventure, we contacted Blue Marlin to discuss these concerns and to understand how the issues raised were being addressed and what actions were being taken.\n\n\"As a result, we made a number of recommendations for Blue Marlin to implement as soon as possible, sharing best practice of some of our own relevant procedures around staff welfare and reiterating our Supplier Code of Conduct.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "Pope Francis was last seen in public at his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday\n\nPope Francis is expected to be discharged from hospital on Saturday, the Vatican has said.\n\nHis return to his Vatican residence at Santa Marta depended on the results of final tests carried out on Friday morning, it added.\n\nThe Pope was admitted to Gemelli Hospital in Rome on Wednesday with breathing difficulties.\n\nHe was later diagnosed as having bronchitis, although the Vatican said he had responded well to antibiotics.\n\nAccording to a statement, the 86-year-old Pope dined on pizza alongside medical staff on Thursday evening and after breakfast on Friday morning read some newspapers and resumed work.\n\nHis admission to hospital came ahead of the busiest time in his annual schedule, with events and services scheduled throughout Easter week.\n\nThe Vatican has revealed the presence of the Pope is now expected in St Peter's Square for Palm Sunday Mass this weekend.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen (WCK) founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s has accused Israeli forces in Gaza of targeting his aid workers \"systematically, car by car\".\n\nMonday's strike which killed seven members of his staff was not a mistake, he said, repeating that Israeli forces had been told of their movements.\n\nWCK workers from Australia, Canada, Poland, the UK and the US were killed as well as their Palestinian colleague.\n\nIsrael says the strike was a \"grave mistake\" and has apologised.\n\nIt has also promised an independent investigation.\n\nAccording to the charity, the aid convoy was hit while leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, \"where the team had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route\".\n\nThe convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo.

Davidson denied the claims.\n\nJohn Davidson was told in 2019 that he was no longer under investigation because there was no evidence of corruption on his part in relation to the Stephen Lawrence case.\n\nThe NCA then investigated Mr Putnam and passed a file to the CPS to consider whether he should be charged with perjury or perverting the course of justice.

I'm not going to lie,\" said James.\n\nBut he was equally excited to see the new King.\n\n\"I had never really thought about the Queen as a force in my life until she died and then it felt like something was missing,\" Jo said.\n\nAt the end of the service, the King and Queen Consort left St Anne's through the west door where they again met members of the public in Writers' Square, before heading back to Belfast City Airport for the return flight to London.", "Denise Gossett, her son Roman, her daughter Sabrina and Sabrina's daughter Morgana were all killed in the fire\n\nA man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing four members of the same family in County Fermanagh.\n\nDaniel Sebastian Allen, 32, from Doon Road near Derrylin, changed his plea as his trial was about to start.\n\nHe admitted the murders of Roman Gossett, 16, his sister Sabrina, 19, and Sabrina's 15-month-old daughter Morgana Quinn.\n\nBut he denied murdering Denise Gossett, 45, and instead admitted manslaughter by reason of a suicide pact.\n\nCraigavon Crown Court was told that plea was acceptable to the prosecution.\n\nDaniel Allen, pictured at a previous court appearance, was at the scene of the fire when the emergency services arrived\n\nAllen's voice broke as he pleaded guilty to a fifth charge of arson with intent to endanger life.\n\nThe fire happened at a cottage the family were renting just outside Derrylin on 27 February 2018.\n\nAllen had been living with the family at the time.\n\nWhen the emergency services arrived he was standing outside and four bodies were discovered inside.\n\nAllen had previously denied murder and claimed he did not play any part in the deaths of Roman and Morgana.\n\nThe rural bungalow house was gutted by the blaze in February 2018\n\nThe judge said: \"Since you have pleaded guilty to three counts of murder I now sentence you to life imprisonment.\"\n\nA defence barrister said: \"Obviously these are serious matters and reports will be required.\"\n\nIn addition to a pre-sentence report, he said time would be required for a number of other professional reports.\n\nA sentencing hearing was set for 15 September when the judge will set the minimum number of years before Allen can be considered for release.\n\nHe will also be given prison sentences for manslaughter and arson.\n\nAllen nodded as the judge told him he would serve life imprisonment for three murders before he was led from the dock in handcuffs.", "I\u00f1aki Ere\u00f1o became CEO of Bupa in the middle of the pandemic\n\nGovernments and healthcare bodies around the world have not learnt the lessons from Covid-19 and are not ready for another pandemic, according to the boss of private healthcare firm Bupa.\n\n\"We might face [another pandemic] soon,\" I\u00f1aki Ere\u00f1o said.\n\nHospitals must be ready to treat infected and non-infected people separately, Mr Ere\u00f1o told the BBC.\n\nIn the UK the unprecedented number of hospital admissions caused by Covid-19 put the NHS under severe strain.\n\n\"The main question is: have we all [around the world] learned a lot, so next time we are ready? My belief is that is not the case,\" Mr Ere\u00f1o said.\n\nCountries need to consider how to minimise disruption to routine healthcare in any future pandemic, he believes.\n\n\"That is something that cannot happen again. We cannot stop the normal delivery of healthcare to people that need us,\" says Mr Ere\u00f1o, pointing to pregnant women and cancer patients.\n\n\"The planning was not good, we cannot empty the hospitals and the clinics just for [a disease like] Covid, and allow people who were going through very severe episodes to stay at home.\"\n\nBupa offers private healthcare insurance to 24 million customers globally. It has 82,000 employees and had a turnover of \u00a314bn last year.\n\nIt also runs its own clinics and hospitals, such as the Cromwell Hospital in London.\n\nIn some countries like Spain its hospitals were used for the treatment of Covid patients. More than half of Spanish hospitals are privately run.\n\nMr Ere\u00f1o believes hospitals need to be ready to be segregated, or alternatively, separate hospitals could be designated for just treating infected people in a future pandemic.\n\nMr Ere\u00f1o says hospitals must be ready to treat infectious people separately\n\nMaking sure hospitals in the UK are better prepared for a future pandemic is a good idea but may be hard to implement, says Paul Elkington, professor of respiratory medicine at Southampton University.\n\n\"Another pandemic is inevitable,\" he says, \"but since Covid-19 the NHS has been hit by a sequence of challenges including staff striking across the sector, the Ukraine war creating supply chain disruption and high energy costs. With all these day-to-day issues it's very hard for NHS managers to focus on the next pandemic.\"\n\nHe says investment would be needed to modify buildings to have things like \"clean entrances\" for non-infectious people.\n\nWhile private healthcare providers stepped in during the pandemic to help clear non-urgent care waiting lists, this is not ultimately sustainable, says Prof Elkington.\n\nMr Ere\u00f1o also questioned whether countries had enough personal protective equipment (PPE) in stock.\n\n\"Do we have already all the protective equipment [we need in every country] ready just in case there is another pandemic? My guess is that not in every place. It is not happening as it should be.\n\n\"But we have the protective equipment we need for our people [in Bupa].\"\n\nHospitals around the world had to rush to order in face masks and other PPE back in 2020\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) released a report last year that was critical of PPE preparedness in the NHS prior to the pandemic.\n\nProf David Strain, chair of the BMA board of science, says that more needs to be learned.\n\n\"Large stockpiles alone aren't enough: the PPE we have must be fit for use. The medical workforce is diverse, which means we need PPE for different face and body shapes, varying hair textures, head coverings, and facial hair. This was a failing at the outset of the pandemic and still hasn't been addressed for those NHS staff dealing with Covid today.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic and have already concluded a review of emergency preparedness measures, which includes PPE, that need to be available in the event of a future pandemic.\n\n\"This is already making a difference, helping to ensure our future hospitals can adapt to changing health needs as part of our New Hospital Programme.\"\n\nAn independent public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic was set up in the UK last year, chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett.

SpaceX launch: How it really went... in 59 seconds\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX company's mammoth new rocket, Starship, has exploded on its maiden flight.\n\nNo-one was hurt in the uncrewed test that lifted off from Texas' coast on Thursday morning local time.\n\nAfter two to three minutes into the flight, the rocket - the biggest ever developed - started to tumble out of control and was soon destroyed by onboard charges.\n\nMr Musk has said his company will try again in a couple of months.\n\nSpaceX engineers still class Thursday's mission as a success. They like to \"test early and often\" and are not afraid to break things. They will have gathered a mass of data to work towards the next flight. A second Starship is almost ready to take flight.\n\n\"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months,\" Mr Musk tweeted.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses rocket launches in the US, said it would oversee a mishap investigation. A spokesman said this was standard practice when a vehicle was lost in flight.\n\nWith the vehicle out of control, the flight had to be terminated\n\nThe entrepreneur had tried to temper expectations before the launch. Just getting the vehicle off the ground and not destroying the launch pad infrastructure would be considered \"a win\", he said.\n\nHis wish was granted. Starship cleared its launch complex on the US-Mexico border and picked up pace as it headed out over the Gulf of Mexico. But it was evident within a minute or so that not everything was going to plan.\n\nElon Musk (front centre) watched the launch from the Texas control room\n\nAs the rocket climbed higher and higher, it could be seen that six of the 33 engines at the base of the vehicle had been shut down or had flamed out.\n\nAnd three minutes into the flight, it was pretty obvious the end was near. When the two halves of the vehicle should have been separating, they were in fact still connected - and veering off course.\n\nAt launch-plus-four-minutes, as Starship was losing altitude, a large explosion ripped across the blue sky, the result of computers triggering the vehicle's Flight Termination System (FTS).\n\n\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,\" SpaceX said in a statement.\n\nStarship reached a maximum altitude over the Gulf of 39km\n\nThe top segment of Starship, also known as the ship, had taken flight previously on short hops, but this was the first time it had launched with its lower-stage.\n\nThis immense booster, called simply Super Heavy, was fired while clamped to its launch mount in February. However, its cluster of engines on that occasion were throttled back to half their capability.\n\nIf, as promised, SpaceX went for 90% thrust on Thursday, the stage should have delivered something close to 70 meganewtons.\n\nThat's double the thrust put out by the Saturn V rocket that famously sent men to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nStarship may not have destroyed its launch pad but later pictures indicated the forceful departure had done a fair amount of damage to concrete surfaces.\n\nThe plan for the mission had been to send the ship on one near-complete revolution of the Earth, ending with a splashdown in the Pacific, a couple of hundred km north of Hawaii.\n\nThere was no expectation that the ship or Super Heavy would be recovered. However, long term, this is the plan. The idea is to land both halves, refuel them and launch again - over and over.\n\nIf this can be achieved, it will be transformative.\n\nStarship has a prospective payload performance to orbit of more than 100 tonnes per flight. When this is allied to the low cost of operation - principally, just the cost of fuel - it should open the door to an exciting future.\n\n\"In the industry, there's certainly a very high expectation at the potential of this vehicle for disruption,\" said space consultant Carissa Bryce Christensen.\n\n\"Its massive capacity, from a commercial standpoint, could be significant. A very large vehicle that's human-rated could be important for the emergence of space tourism. The other element is the vehicle being inexpensive. So, you've got a vehicle with two transformational aspects - massive capacity and, potentially, at a very low price,\" the CEO of BryceTech told BBC News.\n\nArtwork: Nasa has given SpaceX $3bn for a Human Landing System based on Starship\n\nThe entrepreneur will initially use Starship to launch thousands more satellites for his broadband internet constellation in the sky - Starlink.\n\nOnly when engineers are confident in the vehicle's reliability will they permit people to fly on the rocket.\n\nThe first mission has already been lined up.

But the court in Brussels has now convicted him of murder and attempted murder in Brussels too.\n\nAnother of those now found guilty of both bombings, Mohamed Abrini, was identified on CCTV fleeing Zaventem airport when his explosives did not go off.\n\nHe became known as the \"man in the hat\" and was among a number of suspects arrested in Brussels a few weeks later. Unlike Abdeslam, Abrini had admitted his role in the attacks, confessing to preparing the explosives for the bombings.\n\nCCTV footage captured Mohamed Abrini (R) and the two airport bombers who blew themselves up\n\nFour other men were found guilty of terrorist murder: Oussama Atar, Osama Krayem, Ali El Haddad Asufi and Bilal El Makhoukhi.\n\nKrayem had been seen with the Metro bomber who blew himself up at Maelbeek.

Ushered onto a bus with shouts of \"Quickly!\", they then disappeared for weeks without trace.\n\nWhen the children, who all have special educational needs, were finally allowed to call home, it was from much deeper inside Russian-occupied territory.\n\nTo get them back, their relatives were forced to make gruelling journeys across thousands of miles into the country that has declared war on them. Only eight of the children have been returned from Perevalsk so far and Artem was one of the last, collected by his mother just this spring.\n\nWhen I reached the school's director by phone, she saw no problem with dressing Ukrainian children in the uniform of an invading army.\n\n\"So what?\" Tatyana Semyonova retorted. \"What can I do? What's it to do with me?\"\n\nI countered that the Z symbolised the war against the children's own country. \"So what?\" the director demanded again. \"What kind of a question is that? No-one is forcing them.\"\n\nSarah Rainsford explores allegations of illegal deportation of Ukrainian children by Russia and meets some of the relatives who have been fighting to get them back\n\nScrolling through the website of Perevalsk Special School, I found the photograph of Artem on public display. It was taken in February 2023, a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in a class to mark Defenders of the Fatherland Day.\n\nThe lesson was dedicated to learning \"gratitude and respect\" for Russian soldiers.\n\nI tried to question the director some more, but the phone line abruptly cut out.\n\nUkrainian children were taken from their homes, dressed in Russian military uniforms, and taught the Russian curriculum\n\nFor Ukraine, the story of Kupyansk Special School is part of a growing body of evidence against Vladimir Putin as a suspected war criminal.\n\nThe International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russia's president in March, accusing him and his children's ombudswoman, Maria Lvova-Belova, of the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.\n\nRussia insists that its motives are purely humanitarian, evacuating children to protect them from danger. Senior officials scorn the ICC indictment, even threatening retaliatory arrests against its representatives.\n\nThe ICC hasn't made the details of its case public and nor has Ukraine, but officials in Kyiv maintain that more than 19,000 children have been taken from occupied areas since the full-scale invasion. We understand that many have come from care homes and residential schools.\n\nWe investigated several cases, including another Special School in Oleshki, southern Ukraine, and found that each time Russian officials made minimal or zero effort to locate any relatives. Ukrainian children were frequently told there was nothing in their country to return to and were subjected, to varying degrees, to a \"patriotic\" Russian education.\n\nThe details and the nuance vary, as there is chaos in war as well as ill intention.\n\nBut there is also a clear, overriding ideology: Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, openly proclaims everything in occupied areas of Ukraine as its own, including the children.\n\nSasha (right) told the BBC it was too distressing to talk about his separation from his mother\n\nSasha is a tall, shy boy with a long fringe that he likes to smooth into place like any self-conscious teenager.\n\nForced separation from family would be upsetting for any child. For someone vulnerable, like Sasha, it was deeply unsettling. His mother, Tetyana Kraynyuk, tells me he's still withdrawn, months after they were reunited. The 15-year-old even has grey hairs from all the stress.\n\nThey're now living in the western German town of Dinklage as refugees where, after school, Sasha mainly lies on his bed playing on his phone. But he remembers very clearly the moment when Russian soldiers took him away.\n\n\"If I'm honest, it was scary,\" Sasha admits in his quiet voice, rubbing his hands back and forth on his thighs. \"I didn't know where they would take us.\"\n\nWhen I ask about missing his mum he pauses for a long time, says it's too distressing for him to remember and asks if he can change the subject.\n\nBefore the war, Sasha went to Kupyansk Special School in north-eastern Ukraine. He would board during the week, returning home at weekends, but when Russia invaded in February 2022, much of the Kharkiv region was overrun immediately and Tetyana kept her son home for safety.\n\nAs September approached, the occupying administration began insisting that all children return to school, now with the Russian curriculum. There was the same push in all occupied areas, often using teachers from Russia to replace those locals who refused to collaborate.\n\nTetyana was reluctant to send Sasha back, but the teenager was bored stiff after seven months in their village, so on 3 September she dropped him off in Kupyansk.\n\nDays later, Ukrainian forces launched their lightning operation to re-take the region.\n\n\"We heard the noise from miles away. The booms. Then the helicopters and the firing. It was a terrible din. Then I saw the tanks and the Ukrainian flag,\" Tetyana remembers of the counter-offensive.\n\nUnable to contact her son, she was frantic.\n\n\"When we reached the school only the caretaker was left. He said the kids had been taken and no-one knew where,\" Tetyana says.\n\nTetyana went weeks not knowing what had become of her son\n\nA teacher saw what happened that day, when as many as 10 heavily armed Russian soldiers \"swooped into\" the school.\n\n\"They didn't care about taking any documents or contacting parents,\" Mykola Sezonov told me, when we met in Kyiv. \"They just shoved the kids in a bus with some refugees and left.\"\n\nI put to him Russia's defence in such cases: that it was removing children from danger.\n\n\"I lived under Russian occupation, and I know the difference between what they say and what I see for myself through the window,\" was the teacher's response.\n\nFor six weeks, there was no word of the children.\n\n\"I cried every day, called the hotline and told them I'd lost my son and wrote to the police. We tried to find him through volunteers,\" Tetyana says.\n\nIt was a full month before a friend spotted a video on social media, dated early September 2022. It reported that 13 children from Kupyansk Special School had been moved east to a similar facility in Svatove, still under Russian control.\n\nAnother fortnight after that, Tetyana's phone beeped with a message: Sasha was at a Special School in Perevalsk, she read, and his mum could call to talk to him.\n\n\"He was happy to hear me, of course. But he really cried,\" Tetyana recalls of the moment they spoke. \"They'd told him his home was destroyed and he'd been afraid we were gone too.\"\n\nCommunication with areas of heavy fighting is not easy, but the Kupyansk children passed through three institutions before anyone tried to reach any relatives.\n\n\"There was nothing. Only from Perevalsk, and even then not immediately. I think they did it on purpose,\" says Tetyana.\n\nShe would have to return Sasha home in person, but the direct route crossed the frontline. Instead, Tetyana travelled from Ukraine through Poland and the Baltics before crossing on foot into Russia, where the FSB Security Service then interrogated her about Ukrainian troop movements.\n\n\"It was pitch dark, there were checkpoints, men in balaclavas with guns. I was so scared I took pills to calm me,\" Tetyana remembers of the rest of the trip into occupied eastern Ukraine.\n\nShe had another reason to be frightened. By then, Russia was openly taking children from care homes in occupied areas and placing them with Russian families.\n\nRussia has changed its laws to make it easier to adopt Ukrainian children\n\nThe Telegram channel of the children's ombudswoman is full of videos showing her escorting groups of Ukrainian children across the border, where bewildered youngsters are greeted by Russian foster parents with gifts and hugs as the cameras roll.\n\nWe sent two requests for an interview with Maria Lvova-Belova and got no reply. But the message from all her posts is clear: Russia is the good guy in what it still refuses to call a war. Russia claims it's saving Ukrainian children.\n\nBy the time Sasha disappeared from Kupyansk, Vladimir Putin had already amended the law to make it easier for Ukrainian children to get Russian citizenship and be adopted. In late September he announced the annexation of four regions of Ukraine, including Luhansk where Sasha was then located.\n\nIn public and online, Maria Lvova-Belova referred repeatedly to children in those regions as \"ours\". She adopted a teenager from Mariupol herself, posting pictures with his new Russian passport.\n\n\"I was afraid that if they took Sasha into Russia, I would never find him. I was afraid he'd be put in a foster family, just like that,\" Tetyana tells me.\n\n\"What have our children got to do with anything? Why did they do this to us? Maybe it's just to cause us pain, like with everything else.\"\n\nSo when she finally reached Perevalsk, after an exhausting five days on the road, Tetyana hugged her son to her tightly. Sasha didn't say a word. He was crying from happiness.\n\nThe BBC joined Alla Yatsenyuk and a group of other mothers as they made their way to Russia to save their children\n\nFor six months, Alla Yatsenyuk felt like part of herself was missing.\n\nWhen she packed her 13-year-old son off to camp in Crimea, she thought Danylo was heading for two weeks by the sea. It was meant to be a break from the stress of war: other kids from Kherson had been to camp and come back, so Alla wasn't worried.\n\nBesides, their city had been occupied since the very start of the invasion and by October 2022, she'd begun to think Russia would control Kherson for good, though she didn't want that.\n\nBut days after Alla waved Danylo off, the officials responsible for him announced that the children would not return. The Russians had begun retreating from Kherson. If the children's parents wanted them back, they were told they should come for them.\n\nAlla pleaded with the regional administration but was told they would only return the children \"when Kherson is Russian again.\" She called the Prosecutor's Office in Crimea, but they insisted she had to get Danylo herself.\n\nAnd so for weeks, Alla reassured her son that she was coming for him even as she tried to work out how.\n\nThe distance from Kherson to Yevpatoria is short but the direct route was closed by the Russian military and a far longer route through Zaporizhzhia was too dangerous. \"There was a less than 5% chance of getting there and back safely,\" Alla was told.\n\nShe would also need around $1,500 (\u00a31,200) for a driver, as well as her first ever passport and all the paperwork the Russians were demanding to prove her link to her son.\n\nAlla was already starting to despair when Danylo said officials at his camp were threatening to place the children in care if their parents didn't hurry.\n\n\"The kids have been calling us in panic, saying that they don't want to end up in homes,\" Alla fretted. \"And Russia is huge! Where would we look for them then?\"\n\nWe met as she finally set off in a train carriage full of other mums and grandmothers on the most anxious journey of their lives.\n\nThe women were being helped by a group called Save Ukraine, which stepped in when it emerged that hundreds of Ukrainian children might be stranded. Some were from broken homes or less well-off families, struggling with the logistics and funding for the trip. Other parents had been hesitant about returning their children to cities under heavy Russian fire.\n\n\"I still have this gnawing worry something will go wrong. It will be there until I have my son next to me. Then I can breathe again.\"\n\nOver a week later, Alla was one of the last to cross the border back from Belarus, dragging a big suitcase into Ukraine past concrete boulders and anti-tank defences. Danylo, with his dimpled grin, was finally safe beside her.\n\nDanylo (centre) as he crossed the border from Belarus into Ukraine after months away from home\n\nThere had been moments when she thought she wouldn't make it.\n\nSave Ukraine had instructed the women to turn off their phones when they entered Russia, so the details of their traumatic journey only began spilling out between welcome hugs.\n\n\"They kept us like cattle, separate from anyone else. Fourteen hours with no water, no food, nothing,\" Alla described being held by Russia's FSB security service at a Moscow airport. \"They kept asking us what military equipment we had seen, they checked our phones a million times and asked about all our relatives.\"\n\nThe women continued the 24-hour drive south to Crimea. As they drew close, they stopped for a break and 64-year-old Olha Kutova took a couple of steps, collapsed, and died by the side of the road. After days cramped-up in a minibus, in a state of stress, her heart had given out. Now Save Ukraine is trying to return Olha's ashes, as well as her granddaughter.\n\nEventually, Alla made it to the camp.\n\n\"The moment I saw my child running towards me in tears, it made up for everything we'd been through,\" Alla described her reunion, at last, with Danylo.\n\nHer son tells me it was \"just brilliant!\"\n\nSave Ukraine returned 31 children that day and several confirmed that camp staff had threatened to place them in care, which had scared them.\n\nThey talked of being taken on excursions at the start, and being reasonably fed and clothed. But on Russian-controlled territory they were treated and taught as Russians. When inspectors visited from Moscow, the Ukrainians had to line up beside the Russian flag and sing the Russian anthem.\n\nIn October, the occupying administration of Kherson posted a video on Telegram of such a moment. Russia's anthem booms through loudspeakers and the tricolour flag is unfurled. But look a little closer and it's clear that none of the children's lips are moving.\n\nThe camera operator suddenly realises that one girl has her hands over her ears to block out the sound. Too late, they zoom away from her.\n\nA few weeks after her return, I call Alla in Kherson.\n\n\"Everything was finally over, once we made it here,\" she tells me cheerfully down the line.\n\nDanylo has finally been reunited with his mother Alla\n\nShe admits there was some bad feeling towards the summer-camp mums at the start, seen as \"collaborators\" for sending their children to Russian-run facilities in the first place. But Alla feels that has faded.\n\nIn her own family, Danylo is back to bickering with his younger brother and studying online, in Ukrainian. But with no internet at home, she has to dash into the city centre to hunt for wi-fi to download his schoolwork, and that's risky.\n\nSince the Russians were forced into retreat, abandoning Kherson, they've been taking their revenge on the city from across the river.\n\n\"They're shelling from morning to night,\" Alla confirms, though she says their house is relatively far from Russian positions. They have no plans to leave.\n\nDanylo is still in a group chat with the other children from camp and most who remained have now been collected. But he says five were transferred to a care home somewhere in Russia.\n\nAlla forwards me a photograph of their room with rows of single beds, a cheap rug and a spider plant. Where the left-behind children go from there isn't clear.\n\nIn rural Germany, Sasha has had time to settle into life and another new school, but Tetyana is finding the adjustment a little harder.\n\nIn their flat, over a pile of sprat sandwiches, she explains that her eldest son is still in Ukraine expecting to be called up to fight any day. Tetyana wants nothing more than to go home to her husband, too, but Kupyansk is under heavy fire again.\n\nIn late April, Russian missiles destroyed the local history museum, killing two women. Before that, Sasha's old school in the city was badly damaged when missiles landed nearby.\n\nEight months after he and the other children were taken from there, five still remain in Russian-controlled territory. The director of the school where they ended up, Tatyana Semyonova, confirmed that when I called.\n\nThe BBC's Sarah Rainsford managed to speak to the director of the school over the phone\n\nI was surprised she agreed to talk at all, but the Russian number I used must have confused her. So did my questions.\n\nThe director claimed no-one had been in touch about the five, which we know isn't true, and insisted she would hand them \"straight back\" as soon as their legal guardians come to collect them.\n\nBut that's unlikely: various sources tell me the children are treated as \"social orphans\", whose parents are alive but who are not allowed or able to care for them.\n\nWhen I asked why Russia could take children without permission from Ukraine, but demanded a pile of paperwork to return them, Tatyana Semyonova was short.\n\n\"What's that got to do with me? I didn't bring them here.\"\n\nOn the website of her school in Perevalsk, I see a large picture of the director staring out, bleached hair sitting on a strip of dark brown like she's wearing a helmet. The photographs of Artem, Sasha's classmate, with a Z mark, are publicly displayed on the same site.\n\nSasha has identified two more of the missing children from Kupyansk among the school pictures: 12-year-olds Sofiya and Mikita are dressed up and standing in line to celebrate the Russian military.\n\nI ask Sasha's mother what she makes of the arrest warrant issued for Russia's president.\n\n\"Not only Putin, but all his main people - all the commanders - should be on trial for what they did to the kids,\" Tetyana Kraynyuk answers, without hesitating.\n\n\"What right did they have [to take the children]? How were we supposed to get them back? They just didn't care.\"", "Becky Hiton says her anxiety is \"sky high\" and that she will have to leave childminding once the government's funded hours are extended\n\nA drastic decline in childminders could lead to a shortage of places, early years providers are warning.\n\nThere were 9,800 fewer childcare workers in 2022 than in 2019, with childminders down by a fifth.\n\nSome have told the BBC they are being forced to leave because of a lack of pay and appreciation.\n\nChildcare places in England fell by 2% this year, but the government says the population of pre-school children is also decreasing.\n\nWorking parents of three and four-year-olds are currently eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare during term time. By September 2025 this will be extended to children from nine months old.\n\nBut the sector is facing severe workforce challenges.\n\nBecky Hiton, a former teaching assistant and single mum from the Wirral, has been childminding for 10 years. She only takes on children who do not have access to government-funded hours, because she says the amount paid is too low.\n\nOnce the government is paying for all pre-school children of working parents to have 30 hours, she says she will have to leave the profession: \"I'm all for helping parents, but the payments they are offering are nowhere near what I charge now, so I wouldn't make ends meet.\n\n\"My families are happy with everything I offer so it would be a shame to throw it all away, but I need to keep my household running.\"\n\nIn just one year, between March 2022 and 2023, registered childminders in England fell by 3,500 (11%) - meaning a loss of more than 20,000 childcare places, data from Ofsted shows.\n\nHelen Donohoe, chief executive at the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, says the numbers \"are absolutely falling off a cliff\" and that in a decade there will be less than a thousand left, leaving parents with \"a lack of choice\". She says almost half of people who work in the sector are on in-work benefits.\n\nAt a weekly gathering of the Wirral Childminding Association, which was set up for rural childminders to help and support each other, some are questioning their future.\n\nAll of the childminders in Nikki Griffiths' local group are full and are being inundated with inquiries\n\nNikki Griffiths, who runs the group, says childminders are like \"micro-nurseries\" who have to follow an early years curriculum and do training in their own time, but they are sometimes not seen as professionals.\n\nShe says her local authority pays \u00a34 an hour for three and four-year-olds, so with three children under the age of five, she earns \u00a312 an hour before she has paid for anything else, including training, insurance, utilities and food. \"We feel so undervalued.\"\n\nFrom September, the rate the government will pay on average will increase to \u00a35.62 per hour for three and four-year-olds and \u00a37.95 for two-year-olds. But early-years charities says the cost of providing these places is much higher.\n\nAs well as childminders, the number of staff working for school-based nurseries and for nurseries run by voluntary organisations is falling. Private nurseries were the only type of childcare provider to be employing more staff in 2022 than they were in 2019.\n\nThe most recent figures show there are 334,000 early-years workers, down 10,000 on the peak seen in 2019.\n\nThe government says it is launching a national campaign to support the recruitment and retention of staff.\n\nTo help combat childminders leaving, it is also offering payments of \u00a3600 for those who sign up, and \u00a31,200 for those who join through an agency.\n\nProposals to help providers recruit and retain staff include getting rid of the need for a maths qualification, and changing ratios.\n\nBut Neil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, says the plans \"are unlikely to be enough to boost workforce numbers\" and \"risks a de-professionalisation of the workforce\".\n\nThe National Day Nurseries Association says one way of plugging the gap could be allowing the sector to recruit from abroad.\n\nStaff at the Jubilee Wood nursery are offered a 75% discount on childcare fees so they can afford to work\n\nZoe Raven, founder of Acorn Early Years Foundation, which is a social enterprise, would love to expand and open new nurseries but the workforce issue is stopping her.\n\n\"I can't come up with a whole new staff team\", she says.\n\nOne of her nurseries in Milton Keynes, Jubilee Wood, currently makes a loss, as most of the children rely on government-funded hours. It is subsidised by nurseries in more affluent areas, which charge higher fees.\n\nZoe worries that when the government's expansion is fully in place, \"there will be an awful lot of women who won't be able to get back to work after they have taken maternity leave\".\n\nMPs from the education committee are expected to release their report into the childcare sector later this week.\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) says it is rolling out \"the single biggest investment in childcare in England ever, set to save a working parent using 30 hours of childcare up to an average of \u00a36,500 per year\".\n\nThe DfE official adds: \"To make sure there are enough places across the country, we will be investing hundreds of millions of pounds each year to increase the amounts we pay providers - and will be consulting on how we distribute funding to make sure it is fair.\"\n\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

New York prosecutors allege he hatched a \"brazen\" scheme that enriched his friends.\n\nHe allegedly supplied confidential information that allowed them to profit from buying or selling related stocks.\n\nThe court granted two co-accused, Mr Lewis' pilots, bail of $250,000.\n\nHis lawyer David Zornow earlier said charging the tycoon was an \"egregious error\".\n\nHe added that the charges would be \"defended vigorously in court\", and that the 86-year-old had come to the US voluntarily to defend himself against the \"ill-conceived charges\".\n\nHe usually resides in the Bahamas, but surrendered on Wednesday to federal authorities in the US.\n\nIn a statement, a Tottenham Hotspur spokesperson said the charges facing Mr Lewis had no bearing on the club: \"This is a legal matter unconnected with the club and as such we have no comment.\"\n\nIt's been noted that last October the club made a filing to Companies House confirming that Lewis was - the club said - \"no longer a person with significant control at the club\".\n\nMr Lewis was charged with 16 counts of security fraud, and three counts of conspiracy for crimes alleged to have taken place between 2013 to 2021, according to the 29-page indictment.\n\nAllegations against Mr Lewis were laid out in a video statement posted to the US State Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"We allege that, for years, Joe Lewis abused his access to corporate board rooms and repeatedly provided inside information to his romantic partners, his personal assistants, his private pilots, and his friends,\" US attorney Damian Williams said in the video.\n\nMr Williams, the chief federal law enforcement officer for the SDNY, alleged that Mr Lewis's acquaintances used that information to make millions of dollars in the stock market.\n\n\"Thanks to [Mr] Lewis, those bets were a sure thing,\" he claimed. \"None of this was necessary. Joe Lewis is a wealthy man\", he added.\n\nThe indictment quoted one pilot texting a friend that \"Boss lent Marty and I $500,000 each for this,\" and that he thought \"the Boss has inside info\" because \"otherwise why would he make us invest\".\n\nIt listed several occasions on which Mr Lewis allegedly told his pilots to sell or invest in shares on the stock exchange, after he received confidential information.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Mr Lewis told a girlfriend to invest in a biotech company in July 2019, before the results of its clinical trial were made public.\n\nAfter speaking to his girlfriend, he allegedly logged into her bank account himself and used almost all of her available funds to invest into the company - amounting to $700,000. She then sold the shares for a profit of $849,000, say prosecutors.\n\nThe indictment listed many other alleged incidents of Mr Lewis telling friends, girlfriends and employees to invest in stocks based on insider information.\n\nInsider trading is the illegal practice of using confidential information to trade on the stock exchange to one's advantage.\n\nMr Lewis is reported to be one of Britain's richest men. According to the indictment he has a 98-metre superyacht that at times is his primary residence.\n\nHe also owns a stake in UK pub chain Mitchells & Butlers.

One of Trump\u2019s lawyers told the presiding judge that the former president was pleading not guilty to all charges.\n\nThere was some back-and-forth over what kind of contact Trump could have with his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, and with potential witnesses in his case. The former president was released without any restrictions on his travel.\n\nOutside the courthouse, and on social media, it was a very different scene.\n\nThroughout the day, the former president posted to his Truth Social website, insulting Special Counsel Jack Smith and questioning why he wasn\u2019t investigating alleged crimes by Democrats.\n\n\u201cOne of the saddest days in the history of our country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are a nation in decline!!!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s standard rhetorical fair for Trump, who tends to launch his fiercest attacks when he feels the most threatened.\n\nThe other message Trump sent following his arraignment was a more subtle political one. His motorcade stopped at Versailles, a Cuban restaurant and bakery popular with residents of the Little Havana neighbourhood and tourists alike.\n\nWhile there, he shook hands, took pictures and made brief remarks, as patrons serenaded the soon-to-be 77-year-old former president with a rendition of Happy Birthday.\n\nIt looked and felt like a typical meet-and-greet for a campaigning politician in a key battleground state.

Teachers are eligible to apply for the payments from September 2023 and March 2024.\n\nAcademies and free schools in England have been able to recruit teachers without formal teaching qualifications since 2012, when the requirement was scrapped by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government.\n\nIt is unclear if the new policy would affect private schools, which are also able to recruit teachers without formal qualifications.\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), welcomed Labour's plans but said the party could still do more.\n\n\"Schools are in the middle of a recruitment and retention crisis, so it is right that Labour should make this a high priority,\" he said.\n\n\"The ambition for every class to be taught by a qualified teacher is also welcome - every parent should be able to expect that their child is taught by someone with the requisite expertise.\n\n\"Plans to improve early career training and ongoing professional development are sensible but Labour will need to be prepared to go further if they are to begin to solve the current crisis.\n\n\"We know that issues such as uncompetitive pay and a punitive inspection system are key factors in pushing people out of the profession, and it is only by tackling these that we will see teaching and school leadership become an attractive proposition once again.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: \"We have seen yet more evidence this morning that Labour cannot be trusted on a word they say.\n\n\"Labour have flip-flopped so many times on education policy there is no guarantee they will actually stick to this latest announcement.\n\n\"Only the Conservatives are delivering on education and driving up literacy rates - putting parents and pupils first.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA powerful cyclone has hit the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar after intensifying into the equivalent of a category-five storm.\n\nCyclone Mocha did not make landfall at the sprawling refugee camp in Cox's Bazar as earlier feared, but still tore apart hundreds of makeshift shelters.\n\nAt least six people have been reported dead in Myanmar.\n\nUp to 90 per cent of the western Rakhine state's capital city Sittwe has been destroyed, residents told the BBC.\n\nThe Burmese military has declared the whole of Rakhine as a natural disaster area.\n\nBy late Sunday, the storm had largely passed. Bangladesh's disaster official Kamrul Hasan said the cyclone caused \"no major damage\", but landslides and floods are still hitting the country. No casualties have been reported in Bangladesh so far.\n\nMyanmar appears to have borne more direct impact, with the storm crashing through houses and cutting power lines in Rakhine state. Myanmar's meteorological department said it pounded through the country at about 209km/h (130 mph).\n\nCamps for displaced Rohingya in the state have also been ripped apart.\n\nLocal media reported that a 14-year-old boy were among those reported dead - he was killed by a falling tree in the state.\n\nElectricity and wireless connections were disrupted across much of Sittwe. Footage online showed roofs being blown off houses, telecom towers brought down, and billboards flying off buildings amid teeming rain across the region.\n\nAuthorities have declared Rakhine state a natural disaster area, while the Myanmar Red Cross Society said it was \"preparing for a major emergency response\".\n\nMyanmar appears to have borne more direct impact from the cyclone\n\nVillagers in Myanmar flee their homes as the storm approaches\n\nAuthorities in Bangladesh had evacuated 750,000 people ahead of the storm.\n\nThe streets of Cox's Bazar emptied as the cyclone intensified - the skies darkened, the winds picked up pace and the rains pounded down.\n\nHundreds of people crammed into a school which had been turned into a temporary cyclone shelter.\n\nMothers with babies, young children, the elderly and the frail packed into any available space in the classrooms, sleeping on desks and sitting under them.\n\nAs many arrived at the shelter in rickshaws and on foot, they brought their livestock - cattle, chickens, goats - as well as mats to sleep on.\n\nThey had come from fishing and coastal villages up to two hours away, making a difficult choice.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave my house,\" said Sumi Akter, who lives on a riverbank.\n\nSumi and others we met here say they have lived through other cyclones in recent years and are resigned to the regular pattern of leaving their homes to the mercy of nature.\n\nStorm surges of up to four metres could swamp villages in low-lying areas. Sumi and others here are fearful their homes may be submerged.\n\n\"I wish the homes we lived in were built more strongly,\" she said.\n\nJannat, aged 17, whom we had met the day before in the same shelter, said she too was terrified of what might happen to her home on the riverbank.\n\nLast year, another cyclone, Sitrang, destroyed her house, forcing her to spend what little money she had on repairing it.\n\n\"How can I live if this keeps happening? I can't afford to rebuild it - we are very poor,\" she said.\n\nNature was also punishing the poor in the world's largest refugee camp nearby.\n\nBangladesh's government does not allow Rohingya refugees to leave the camps, nor to build permanent structures.\n\nAs the cyclone hit, they hunkered down in flimsy bamboo shelters with tarpaulin roofs. Some were moved to community shelters within the camps, which offered little more protection.\n\nAuthorities told the BBC that more than 1,300 shelters were damaged by the wind, as were 16 mosques and learning centres. Trees had fallen in the camps, while two landslides also caused some damage.\n\nThe tarpaulin that covered Mohammed Ayub's shelter was torn off by the winds. Now he and his family of eight are living in the open, in wet and miserable weather.\n\nHaving spent the days before terrified of what Cyclone Mocha could bring, Mohammed was relieved the camps didn't take a direct hit from the storm.\n\nMizanur Rahman, from the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, said that as far as he was aware, there were no casualties in the camps as a result of the cyclone.\n\nFamilies with young children are crammed into makeshift cyclone refuges\n\nEvacuees at one cyclone shelter told the BBC they were worried about the lack of food\n\nForecasters warned Cyclone Mocha could be the most powerful storm seen in Bangladesh in nearly two decades.\n\nThe Bangladeshi meteorological department office said the maximum sustained wind speed within 75km (45 miles) of the centre of the cyclone was about 195km/h (120mph), with gusts and squalls of 215km/h.\n\nIn preparation for the storm's arrival, nearby airports had been shut, fishermen were ordered to suspend their work and 1,500 shelters set up as people from vulnerable areas were moved to safer spots.\n\nIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis tore through the southern coastal regions of Myanmar, killing almost 140,000 people and severely affecting millions.

Many goals, assists and consistency. We had four or five months without him and now we need him at the end of the season.\n\n\"I think he likes to score goals but I don't know if he enjoys it more to make an assist.

It shows we are able to create chances - but of course when you concede four goals, you lose.\"\n\nCity were too strong in the end and, while Guardiola was able to rest Foden and Bernardo Silva, De Bruyne stepped up to show his quality and claim his landmark goal after an injury-plagued season.\n\nIn another boost, defender John Stones managed to play the full match upon his return after being injured on England duty.\n\nPalace have proved a tough opponent for City in the past - they came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December - so this was a vital victory for Guardiola's side to keep up the pressure on their rivals.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory.\n\n\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nShe has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed.\n\nSide by side, the natural and synthetic mouse embryos looked very similar after eight days\n\nThe synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.\n\nProf Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos.\n\n\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\"\n\nMost countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.\n\nHowever, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.\n\nDr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\"\n\nLegal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.\n\nResearchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.\n\nProf Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.\n\n\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\"", "Hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered in Warsaw for one of Poland's largest demonstrations since the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nMost opposition parties have called on supporters to join the march against the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\n\nAmong those attending are former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and former President Lech Walesa.\n\nThe PiS has condemned the gathering as a \"march of hate\".\n\nThe mayor's office for Warsaw has estimated half a million people attended the event, which fell on the 34th anniversary of Poland's first partially-free elections.\n\nMany travelled from across the country to take part, and simultaneous demonstrations have been held in other Polish cities like Krakow.\n\nA wide variety of issues brought protests together, including frustrations over inflation, costs of living, and rights for women and LGBT.\n\nConcerns have also been raised against new law accused of undermining Poland's democracy.\n\nThe law, criticised by the EU and US, sets up a commission to investigate undue Russian influence in Polish politics, and has the power to ban people from assuming public office for 10 years.\n\nThe government denies it is subverting democracy and President Andrzej Duda has proposed amendments to remove these powers.\n\nBut critics say it could still be used against people, including Mr Tusk - Poland's main opposition leader and head of the centrist Civic Platform (PO) party.\n\nOpponents say it could also bolster the PiS' standing in this year's parliamentary elections.\n\nThe protest was attended by former President Lech Walesa (left) and former Prime Minister Donald Tusk (right)\n\nCrowds of people have been pictured waving Polish and EU flags and holding placards, and participants told the BBC that protesters were chanting \"democracy\" and \"we will win\".\n\n\"I came here to defend democracy because I can't stand how our parliament, the constitutional tribunal are destroyed, the European Union is diminished,\" one protester told Reuters news agency.\n\nDonald Tusk, a former head of the European Council, also welcomed supporters during the \"record\" march.\n\n\"Democracy dies in silence but you've raised your voice for democracy today, silence is over, we will shout,\" said Mr Tusk.\n\nAhead of the event, the PiS accused organisers of of hypocrisy, tweeting a video about police brutality and violence against the media while Mr Tusk was in office.\n\nWojciech Przybylski, editor of Visegrad Insight, told the BBC that these protests show Poland's opposition groups can unite over common causes, despite their political differences.\n\nBut PiS is still ahead in opinion polls, he adds, and \"this is going to mobilise them, because they know the opposition is for real\".", "Vivienne Groom says she feels she has been \"penalised\" for caring for her elderly mum\n\nA woman has told of her shock after the government seized \u00a316,000 left to her by her mother because she was overpaid her carer's allowance.\n\nVivienne Groom was prosecuted for failing to declare her minimum wage Co-op job while also caring for her mum.\n\nMrs Groom said she was told by a social worker she did not have to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the job.\n\nThe DWP said it was \"right\" it sought to claim back \"taxpayers' money\".\n\nAfter taking the job at the store in Tarvin, near Chester, Mrs Groom was told she had to pay back \u00a316,800.\n\nShe said she initially agreed a payment plan with the DWP at \u00a330 per month to cover the overpayments, which she received between 2014 and 2019.\n\nHowever, when the government discovered she stood to inherit \u00a316,000 following the death of her mum, it decided to seize it.\n\nMrs Groom told the BBC she was devastated by what had happened.\n\n\"I followed that lady's rules and I looked after my mum,\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, if people look after their parents they should be paid more money so they don't have to go to work as well.\n\n\"I had to go to work. We had bills to pay.\"\n\nThe only way for the DWP to recover the money was to prosecute Mrs Groom, so she was charged with benefit fraud offences.\n\nWithout legal representation to assist her, Mrs Groom pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a community order with unpaid work requirements.\n\nShe was, however, forced back to court after the DWP initiated proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA), enabling them to ask a judge to order the confiscation of her inheritance.\n\nThat order was granted on Wednesday, despite a different judge describing himself as \"truly unimpressed\" with the DWP's handling of the case during her sentencing hearing.\n\nAt that earlier hearing, the Recorder of Chester, judge Steven Everett, told Mrs Groom she was \"doing the best you could for your mother\".\n\nSpeaking outside court on Wednesday, her husband, Geoff, told the BBC his wife had been \"penalised for looking after her mum\".\n\nThe DWP has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite having the ability to do so, and allowing the recipients to end up in legal trouble.\n\nBenefit staff get automatic alerts from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if a carer's allowance claimant is earning too much to claim.\n\nOne DWP employee agreed to speak about Mrs Groom's case on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"From 2014 onwards really they had no excuse for having these overpayments carry on for longer than two or three months \u2026 if they're investigating all of the alerts\", he told BBC North West Tonight.\n\n\"DWP should be protecting these people from getting into trouble with their benefits but instead they're persecuting them and treating them like hardened criminals using the Proceeds of Crime Act against them. It's appalling.\"\n\nFive years ago a report from the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee accused the DWP of \"bullying and harassing\" those who had been overpaid.\n\nMargaret Greenwood, Labour MP for Wirral West, told the BBC about 44% of people caring for others for more than 35 hours a week are \"living in poverty\".\n\nShe said to then receive a \"large bill\" for overpayments they are often unaware of \"can be devastating for people\".\n\nLast year the DWP revealed it was seeking to recover 145,567 overpayments of Carers Allowance.\n\nAn extra 26,500 overpayments were added to that total in the last year alone.\n\nA spokesperson for the DWP said: \"We are committed to fairness in the welfare system while protecting the public purse.\n\n\"Claimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their circumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover taxpayers' money when this has not occurred.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

As Rhun was the deputy leader in that team, what's changed?\"\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth has represented the constituency of Ynys M\u00f4n - which covers the Island of Anglesey - since 2013.\n\nThe former BBC Wales political correspondent had previously attempted to become party leader in 2018, when he was beaten by Adam Price.\n\nBefore he became leader - a role that has to be performed by a Member of the Senedd - the politician had been selected to stand for the party in Ynys M\u00f4n at the next general election.\n\nIt will now need to find another candidate, as the new leader confirmed he would not stand for the seat.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth is taking over Plaid Cymru in the absence of a public debate about the party's future and after weeks of near-radio silence from his colleagues.\n\nHe becomes leader with no detailed plans for what he will do - his campaign amounting to a short social media video issued a few weeks ago.\n\nAnd apart from a tweet here and there, there have been few big interventions from party figures.\n\nIt all gives the impression of a party that did not have the appetite for the theatre of a leadership campaign, given everything that has happened.\n\nThe task facing Rhun ap Iorwerth is enormous. Plaid remains vexed by the question of how to break out of its heartlands in north and west Wales.\n\nTo ever have a chance of unseating Labour in Wales it has to win seats in urban Wales, where Plaid struggles.\n\nBut with the party's internal problems out in the open, the hard politics of the ballot box are taking a backseat.\n\u2022 None What we know about Plaid Cymru's new leader", "Ticket prices for the Tower of London have risen by more than 12%\n\nWith the cost of a day out rising, young people are at risk of missing out on important life experiences this summer, a charity has warned.\n\nGo Beyond, which gives vulnerable youngsters holidays, said children could be left isolated and lacking confidence as a result.\n\nTickets for castles, historic sites, gardens, zoos and theme parks have gone up significantly since last year.\n\nHowever, venues told the BBC they were facing rising costs themselves.\n\nThey say higher energy prices, rising wage bills and VAT increases mean they have to pass on some of those costs to visitors.\n\nAt the Titanic visitor centre in Belfast ticket prices are up from \u00a321.50 to \u00a324.95, a rise of 16%. Tickets for Kew Gardens in London are up more than 10% at \u00a320.50. And Stonehenge costs 9% more than it used to, although different price rises apply to different tickets.\n\nFor parents like Hannah Clarke, a single mother with two children, these higher prices make a big difference.\n\n\"It is a massive issue,\" she said. \"It was my daughter's seventh birthday last week and I could only afford the entry cost of where we went because I had saved up supermarket vouchers.\"\n\n\"The trouble is they are changing that scheme, so the vouchers won't go as far as they used to soon.\n\nHannah uses vouchers to cover the cost of days out\n\nHannah said she is trying to be \"more strategic\" about day trips now, looking for free places to visit, and ones that are closer to her home in Rutland, so she can make lunch before they set out.\n\n\"It isn't just the ticket cost but the price of an ice cream when you get there,\" she added.\n\nMichele Farmer, chief executive of Go Beyond, told the BBC that rising prices could lead to some young people becoming isolated from children their own age, which could have a \"negative impact\" on relationships, wellbeing and self-esteem.\n\n\"It would be easy to take for granted just what a difference having those simple childhood experiences can make to a young person,\" she said.\n\n\"Giving children space away from the worries and pressures they face at home gives them the opportunity to grow in confidence.\n\n\"As this summer approaches millions of families who have never had a holiday, now won't be able to afford even the simplest days out,\" she added.\n\nAccording to a survey by Barclays, 52% of the 2,000 people it questioned think tourist sites are pricier now than they were prior to the current squeeze on family budgets.\n\nTwo-fifths of those say they are less likely to spend money visiting these places as a result. Just under a third say that if they do visit attractions, they are less likely to spend money on extras like food, drink and souvenirs.\n\nThe Tower of London says it is offering more for visitors to see\n\nBBC News contacted 15 of the leading paid-for tourist sites in the UK. Most of those that responded said they had put up prices, some by more than the overall rate of inflation, which is just over 10%.\n\nTitanic Belfast said it had made the decision to raise prices based on comparable products and that the venue regularly opened its doors to local people, who were less likely to be able to visit normally.\n\nTickets for the Tower of London go up from \u00a329.90 to \u00a333.60 this year, a 12.3% increase. Historic Royal Palaces said this rise coincided with an increase in what was available to see at the site, and that it was increasing its free and subsidised access at the same time.\n\nThe Royal Horticultural Society said it had had to pass on some costs, raising ticket prices for its gardens by an average of 6.4% this year, but it had introduced a \u00a31 entry scheme for those on the lowest incomes, it said. Kew introduced a \u00a31 ticket in January 2022.\n\nThe National Trust said it had raised prices for adult entry to Bodnant Gardens in Wales from \u00a314 to \u00a315, an increase of more than 7%, to cover the rising costs of lighting, heating and conserving the places in its care.\n\nCardiff Council and Brighton Pier were the only attractions to say they had not put up either entry fees or ride wristband prices.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. David Threadgold said officers are \"deeply offended\" over Police Scotland being branded institutionally racist.\n\nPolice in Scotland have said their job will be made \"more difficult\" by the chief constable saying the force is institutionally discriminatory.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone stressed he did not mean individual officers and staff were racist or sexist.\n\nDavid Threadgold of the Scottish Police Federation, which represents officers, said police had been \"deeply offended\".\n\nHe said members of the public would not distinguish between institutional problems and individual officers.\n\nSir Iain made the remarks on Thursday as he delivered a report to the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) board. It was believed to be the first statement of its kind by a police chief.\n\nHe said: \"It is the right thing for me to do, as chief constable, to clearly state that institutional racism, sexism, misogyny and discrimination exist.\n\nIt came after a review uncovered first-hand accounts of racism, sexism and homophobia by serving officers.\n\nThe independent review group urged the force to be alert to \"backlash\" against efforts to improve matters, and particularly to be aware of \"all lives matter\" views.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf said that, as a person of colour, the admission of was \"monumental\" and \"historic\", while chair of the Scottish Police Authority board Martyn Evans called it a \"watershed moment\".\n\nHowever Mr Threadgold said the reaction had been \"overwhelmingly negative\" among officers.\n\nSir Iain Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority board the force is institutionally racist and discriminatory\n\nInitially speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, he said: \"The use of the phrase institutionally racist is one that has deeply offended and upset them and they do not recognise themselves in that way.\n\n\"That nuance in the delivery of the message was missed absolutely and there is real potential that that has damaged the relationship between the chief constable and those who represent the communities in Scotland.\"\n\nSir William Macpherson's definition of institutional racism, set out in his 1999 report into the killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, is the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin.\n\nIt can include processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.\n\nHowever Mr Threadgold told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that the vast majority of officers perceived the chief constable was \"labelling them as institutionally racist\".\n\nAs a result, he said he believed the job of police officers had been made more difficult by Sir Iain's comments.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHe said: \"The reason for that is they [the public] will hear him speaking and they will also not make that distinction.\n\n\"So when they [officers] are out patrolling in the streets around Scotland this weekend, members of the public will see them, they will make the link to the fact that the chief constable has said that we as an organisation are institutionally racist and that will make our job more difficult.\"\n\nAsked whether the force's priority should be the individuals who experience racist or sexist behaviour, Mr Threadgold said: \"It should be as equal a priority as everything else.\"\n\nBoth Mr Threadgold and Sir Iain accepted there are examples of officers in the force who are discriminatory.\n\nThe chief constable also told the BBC he \"totally accepted\" how institutional discrimination could be conflated with individuals.\n\nHowever he said: \"This is separate matter, this is about policies, practice, systems that have at times unintended or unforeseen consequences that actually discriminate against certain groups.\n\n\"I think it's important to state it as a fact so that we can make progress and make policing and Scotland a better place.\"\n\nPolice Scotland has faced a number of concerns about its culture in recent years.\n\nSome women who are former officers spoke to the BBC's Newsnight about a \"boys club\" culture at all levels of Police Scotland.\n\nOne of them, former firearms officer Rhona Malone, won almost \u00a31m in compensation from the force after an employment tribunal found she had been victimised when she had raised concerns about sexism.\n\nThe force is also under pressure due to an ongoing public inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who was restrained by police officers in Kirkcaldy.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating the circumstances of the 31-year-old's death and whether race was a factor.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Aamer Anwar represents Mr Bayoh's family and spoke to the BBC after the inquiry heard evidence from a former officer involved in the restraint who denied making racist remarks.\n\nIn response to Mr Threadgold's comments, he said the federation was \"in denial\" and should be considering the morale of black, Asian and female officers who had faced discrimination.\n\nHe said: \"It's absolute and utter nonsense. On which occasion have they stood up publicly and robustly defended officers who have been the victim of racist discrimination, of racism?\n\n\"When have they defended those female officers who have been subjected to horrific misogyny? Some officers who we are dealing with at the moment have allegations of sexual violence - where is their defence of those officers?\n\n\"They need to change, they need to get on board and if they're not willing to accept those changes then they need to leave the police service.\"\n\nSir Iain has held the position of chief constable for six years and is to retire on 10 August.\n\nMoi Ali, who was formerly on the SPA board but quit amid a row over meetings being held behind closed doors, said it had taken too long for him to raise the issue of institutional racism in the first place.\n\nMoi Ali said her exit from the board had been a \"really horrendous experience\"\n\nShe told Good Morning Scotland: \"MacPherson talked about institutional racism in 1999. I'm just wondering why it took until the next century for the chief constable, within spitting distance of collecting a very handsome police pension, to mention this.\n\n\"I welcome the fact that the statement has been made, but he's about to walk out of the door and leave the problem that he was part of not solving for a decade.\"\n\nLast year Police Scotland launched a four-year strategy called \"Policing Together\" to tackle discrimination in the force and in the community.\n\nIt recently announced a mandatory leadership programme to be rolled out to about 5,000 officers and staff to improve the existing workplace culture.\n\nEarlier this year the force also stepped up its vetting procedures in response to the case of David Carrick, who admitted dozens of rape and sexual offences as a Met police officer.", "A teachers' union in England is to ballot members on strike action after 87% of its members voted to reject the government's pay offer.\n\nThe NASUWT, which represents 280,000 teachers in the UK, said the offer failed to address its concerns over pay and working conditions.\n\nFour unions have now rejected the offer - including the National Education Union, which is planning more strikes.\n\nThe government has said further strike action was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nMost state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise in 2022.\n\nThey were offered a 4.3% rise next year, as well as a \u00a31,000 one-off payment this year.

unlawfully?\"\n\nMs Letby said she did not know \"where the insulin came from\" and denied causing the baby any harm.\n\nShe also agreed that Child L was poisoned with insulin but added: \"I don't know how the insulin got there.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that any member of staff on the unit would make a mistake in giving insulin,\" she said.\n\nEarlier the court heard that a total of 257 nursing shift handover sheets, containing some of the names of her alleged victims, were found during police searches of her home following her arrest in July 2018.\n\nShe agreed with Mr Johnson that taking such sheets out of the hospital was not \"normal practice\" and they should be discarded in confidential waste.\n\n\"What were you thinking as this pile of handover sheets accumulated almost to the size of a phonebook,\" Mr Johnson asked.\n\nThe defendant said she did not know she \"had that many\".\n\nMr Johnson put it to her that she was keeping the notes for her \"little collection\".\n\nShe added: \"I keep a lot of paper, I have a difficulty throwing anything anyway.\"\n\nThe former nurse said she had kept many items over the years, including cards, letters, notes and did not keep the handover sheets \"because of the content\".\n\nMr Johnson responded: \"Are you really asking the jury to accept that pieces of paper with sensitive information about dead children on them were insignificant?\"\n\nMs Letby told the court she did not take medical handover notes home \"intentionally\"\n\nMr Johnson then asked Ms Letby about a blood gas record chart relating to one of the babies in this case, which was also found at her home.\n\nMr Johnson accuses her of \"fishing it out of the confidential waste bin\".\n\nShe responded: \"I never fished anything out of the confidential waste bin.\"\n\nHe said: \"It was for your little collection, wasn't it?\"\n\nMr Johnson went on to speak about a keepsake box in her former home in Chester, and asked her if she knew what was in it when police raided her home.\n\nMr Johnson explained to the jury that a \"pristine\" handover sheet, dated 1 June 2010, was found in the box.\n\nHe said this was Ms Letby's first day as a student nurse on the Countess of Chester neonatal unit.\n\nMr Johnson said the defendant was \"not prepared to tell the truth about these handover sheets\" but she responded saying \"the truth is what I have told you\".\n\nMs Letby was then asked about a sympathy card she sent to the grieving parents of a baby girl, Child I, who she allegedly murdered.\n\nInside, the defendant wrote: \"There are no words to make this time any easier. It was a real privilege to care for [Child I] and get to know you as a family - a family who always put [Child I] first and did everything possible for her.\n\n\"She will always be part of your lives and we will never forget her.\n\n\"Thinking of you today and always. Lots of love Lucy x.\"\n\nAn image of the card and its inside message was recovered by police from Ms Letby's phone and GPS data confirmed that the image was taken on the neonatal unit, the trial heard.\n\nLucy Letby previously said she photographed the card so she could remember the kind words she sent\n\nMr Johnson asked: \"Why did you write the card at home, and then bring it to work and take a photo of it in the place where the baby had died in dreadful circumstances?\"\n\nMs Letby responded: \"The place is insignificant, I take photos of the majority of cards that I send. This was taken to give to the staff who were going to the funeral.\"\n\nMr Johnson asked her if she took the picture to \"give you a bit of a thrill, taking a picture in the place where the child died?\".\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter?

I've no doubt it will be effectively unanimous across the bar associations.\"\n\nThe lawyer said he hoped the boycott would put an end to the scheme, but said he could not say for certain because the Scottish government was \"so unpredictable\".\n\nHe said lawyers had responded to \"a knee-jerk reaction from the Scottish government - a blatant attempt to increase conviction rates\".\n\n\"There are substantial failings which are highlighted in Lady Dorrian's review of the lack of communication from the Crown, lack of involvement with the police, matters being delayed at an investigative stage, all issues which impact on the conviction rate,\" the lawyer said.\n\n\"The way to deal with this is not to remove a jury of your peers.\"\n\nHe said rape cases are also \"more intimate\" and typically lack evidence such as CCTV footage and extensive witness testimony, leading to lower conviction rates.\n\nMr Murray said the scheme would hamper efforts to diversify the legal system, and countered the Scottish government's point that 80% of trials already took place without a jury.\n\nHe said: \"That's a slightly disingenuous point. Those trials are lower level, consist mainly of minor assaults, shoplifting, cases that are far less serious than cases involving sexual offences.\"\n\nHe echoed concerns about the Scottish review of rape trials lacking relevant evidence, with rules prohibiting researchers speaking to former jurors.\n\n\"There's been almost no investigation or review carried out in relation to the pilot scheme in Scotland,\" Mr Murray said.\n\n\"The Scottish government is going about this in entirely the wrong manner and rather than engaging with the profession, they are ignoring the profession.\"\n\nThe dean of the Faculty of Prosecutors and Solicitors in Dundee confirmed the group had unanimously agreed to boycott the scheme.\n\n\"The crime of rape is a high court matter which has to prosecuted and defended expertly,\" a statement read.\n\n\"It is not in the accused's best interests to be an experimental guinea pig for such a serious matter.\"\n\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said she was \"determined to proceed in partnership\" with lawyers, adding it was \"quite simply not true\" that the government has ignored the legal profession.\n\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance has rejected claims the government has ignored lawyers\n\nShe told BBC Scotland there is \"overwhelming\" evidence that juries have misconceptions about rape.\n\n\"There is international evidence, 50-plus studies most of which have taken place in the past 20 years, that demonstrates the diversity of juries does not overcome unfair influences,\" the minister said.\n\nShe insisted the legal profession, victims and academics would be consulted as part of the parliamentary process.\n\n\"No part of the system is beyond scrutiny, including court processes,\" she said.\n\nMs Constance added: \"I think we have legitimate grounds to have concerns and we have legitimate grounds to proceed with a pilot.\n\n\"But it is important that we engage with all the voices and that's part of our parliamentary and democratic process.\"\n\nThe proposal for juryless trials have been welcomed by victim support group Rape Crisis Scotland, which has warned too many women are being let down by the justice system and too many rapists are walking free.\n\nChief executive Sandy Brindley said: \"What we all want is a system where we can be confident that the evidence being heard in rape trials is being assessed fairly and objectively, and isn't influenced by false assumptions or attitudes towards women.\n\n\"Everyone has the right to a fair trial but that does not automatically mean a jury trial. A single-judge trial is still a fair trial.\"", "Victims of the Troubles have held several protests against the proposed law, including this one in January\n\nThe government has published a series of new amendments to its controversial legacy bill, ahead of its likely passage at Westminster.\n\nIt will introduce an amnesty scheme, stop future inquests into Troubles-era killings and prohibit new civil cases.\n\nOne of the amendments would delay changes for another year to \"ensure a smooth transition\" to new arrangements.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the government was \"absolutely committed\" to the bill.\n\nReacting to the amendments, one victims' group, Relatives for Justice, said they \"only make the situation worse\".\n\nThe bill is opposed by all Northern Ireland political parties, as well as groups representing bereaved families and victims of the Troubles.\n\nThe legislation will establish a new body, the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR), which would take over legacy cases.\n\nIn return for co-operation, it can grant suspects immunity from prosecution.\n\nIn a statement, the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said ongoing police investigations, inquests, the publication of reports and consideration of prosecution decisions will continue until May next year, to allow time for the ICRIR to become fully operational.\n\nAny inquest which has not reached point of verdict or findings would be ended.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Gerry Kelly said: \"The proposed new timeframe for concluding inquests will make it more difficult for families to have this most basic investigation into the killings of their loved ones.\n\n\"The new amendment states that conflict-related inquests must conclude by 1 May next year.\n\n\"This effectively closes the door in the faces of families looking to make progress in a large number of inquests.\n\n\"This amendment is particularly cruel as expectations had been raised among families that once inquests had been opened that they would be concluded.\"\n\nChris Heaton-Harris said the changes address \"a number of key concerns raised by interested parties\"\n\nAnother amendment states any investigation run by the ICRIR must comply with obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nAlso, the ICRIR would be \"under a new duty to offer victims and their families the opportunity to submit personal impact statements\".\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said: \"The government has consistently stated that it would continue constructive dialogue in order to alleviate concerns and strengthen the bill.\n\n\"That is why we have published a number of significant amendments that directly address a number of key concerns raised by interested parties,\" he continued.\n\n\"This includes amendments on the conduct of reviews, compliance with Convention Rights, the independence of the commission, conditional immunity, and ongoing legal processes.\"\n\nThe bill is due to go through its final stages in the House of Lords later this month.\n\nPrior to the NIO announcement, the Irish government repeated its concerns about the bill.\n\nThe Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin said if it was enacted it \"would undermine rather than assist reconciliation\".\n\nVictims' campaigner Raymond McCord said the amendments were disgraceful and disgusting.\n\nHe called for Stormont politicians \"to speak with one voice\" and accused the Conservatives of \"whitewashing the murders of the Troubles\" with the bill.\n\nGrainne Teggart, of Amnesty International UK, said: \"The government is treating troubles victims with contempt - these amendments do nothing to address the fundamental flaws with the bill.\n\n\"No-one is fooled by these changes and the government is still clearly intent on denying victims their basic rights and pressing ahead with a bill only it wants.\"", "Montana is set to become the first US state to ban Chinese-owned media giant TikTok from personal devices.\n\nGovernor Greg Gianforte signed the ban into law on Wednesday. It is due to take effect on 1 January.\n\nThe video-sharing platform says the ban \"infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of Montana\".\n\nTikTok has come under scrutiny from authorities around the world over concerns that data could be passed to the Chinese government.\n\nMr Gianforte, a Republican, told lawmakers that a wider ban would further \"our shared priority to protect Montanans from Chinese Communist Party surveillance.\"\n\nTikTok said in a statement that it was used by \"hundreds of thousands of people\" in Montana.\n\n\"We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana,\" it added.\n\nTikTok is expected to challenge the legislation in the courts.\n\nLast month, lawmakers in Montana passed a bill banning TikTok on personal devices by a vote of 54 to 43.\n\nThe law will make it illegal for app stores to offer TikTok, but does not ban people who already have TikTok from using it.\n\nMontana, which has a population of just over 1m, banned the app on government devices last December.\n\nTikTok says it has 150 million American users. Although the app's user base has expanded in recent years, it is still most popular with teenagers and users in their 20s.\n\nHowever, there are concerns across the US political spectrum that TikTok could be a national security risk.\n\nIn March, a congressional committee grilled TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew about whether the Chinese government could access user data or influence what Americans see on the app.\n\nMr Shou repeatedly said that it would never spy on Americans - despite admitting that employees had used the TikTok accounts of journalists to obtain information about them.\n\nEarlier in March, the US government said ByteDance should sell TikTok or face a possible ban in the country.\n\nThe penalties apply to companies, but not individual users. Firms that break the law face penalties of up to $10,000 (\u00a38,012), which would be enforced by Montana's Department of Justice.\n\nIt means that technology giants like Apple and Google could face fines if they allow TikTok to be downloaded in Montana from their app stores.\n\nTikTok's owner ByteDance has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

However it also pointed out that this was lower than the 5% rise under the super-deduction scheme which this policy replaces.\n\nMr Hunt made the announcement after he confirmed the OBR forecasts the British economy is to avoid a technical recession in 2023 but contract by 0.2%, before returning to growth in 2024.\n\nPlans to hike corporation tax to 25% were first put forward by Rishi Sunak two years ago, when he was chancellor under Boris Johnson.\n\nThe rise was justified as a means to claw back some of the billions of pounds worth of public money that had been used to prop up businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMr Sunak deferred the rise by two years, and in the time since, the policy has been axed, reinstated and divided opinion in the Conservative Party.\n\nKeeping corporation tax at 19% was a key plank of Liz Truss' low-tax leadership platform when she beat Mr Sunak to become prime minister.\n\nOn 23 September, then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng confirmed the move in the Commons, telling the country it would boost growth - but his Budget quickly unravelled.\n\nThree weeks later, Mr Kwarteng was sacked and the 25% policy was readopted by Ms Truss as she sought to get investors and her own party back onside.\n\nSome Tory MPs publicly oppose the rise, including Mr Johnson, despite the fact he signed off on it when he was PM.\n\nDuring a speech earlier this month, Mr Johnson said the government should be \"cutting corporation tax to Irish levels or lower\". The rate is as low as 12.5% for some companies in Ireland.\n\nFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg echoed that view, saying the best approach to tax policy was low rates with few exclusions.\n\nHe told the Commons: \"We have a rise now in corporation tax but we then sort of salami slice it a bit with some capital allowances to pretend it's not much of a rise. This is not a good approach to tax policy.\"", "Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly will take a break from Saturday Night Takeaway after the 2024 series, ITV has said.\n\nReaching the \"milestone\" of 20 series seemed like the \"perfect time to pause for a little while and catch our breath,\" the presenting duo said.\n\nThe series previously took a pause in 2009 - returning four years later.\n\nITV's Kevin Lygo said the broadcaster understood why the duo have \"a desire to take a pause\".\n\n\"When you think of Saturday night television you think of Saturday Night Takeaway,\" ITV's director of television said.\n\nThe most recent series of that show launched in February, with ITV1's biggest overnight audience of the year, attracting 6.4 million viewers.\n\nSince its launch in 2002 it has received multiple Bafta and National Television Awards (NTA), including presenting accolades for Ant and Dec.\n\nThey won their first TV presenting prize at the National Television Awards in 2001 alongside boy band Blue\n\nThe pair will continue their exclusive working relationship with ITV, as hosts of popular shows including I'm A Celebrity...

Individual products will face charges of up to \u00a329. It will apply to goods deemed low, medium and high risk.\n\nThe Cold Chain Federation's chief executive Phil Pluck said the fee would have to be passed on to \"either the EU importer, the smaller UK retailer, or the UK consumer\".\n\n\"Ultimately, this will increase business costs and food prices and potentially lower choices for the shopper,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the government had \"announced the charges at the last minute, leaving affected businesses little time to revise their commercial arrangements\".\n\nThe fee has been introduced to pay for border inspections and fund new facilities in Kent to protect biosecurity - preventing the import of plant and animal disease.\n\nBut the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) said the policy felt like it was \"constructed on the back of an envelope at best\" and would \"undoubtedly increase costs, potentially reduce consumer choice, and increase the likelihood of empty shelves\".\n\n\"Our sector typically has multiple commodity lines per consignment, meaning, in reality, businesses in our sector will be paying the \u00a3145 maximum charge,\" said James Barnes, the HTA chairman.\n\nHorticultural consignments can include plants, seeds, bulbs and cut flowers, he said.\n\nThe government has delayed implementing the changes five times, partly to give business time to prepare and to reduce disruption to supply chains.\n\nThe new border checks will be phased in gradually over the next 12 months but physical checks have been flagged as starting on 30 April for some time. However, the cost associated with those checks had not been revealed until now.\n\nPrior to Brexit, trade between the EU and the UK was free flowing and frictionless.\n\nBut following the UK's departure from the trading bloc, this changed as a result of the relatively distant approach to EU relations adopted by the UK government.\n\nLabour said British shoppers and businesses were \"rightly worried about prices being driven up again\" and that it had warned about the \"potential for chaos\" from new border checks.\n\nShadow minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said: \"With less than a month before their introduction, we now know what the costs will be.\n\n\"Labour has a plan to reduce costly bureaucracy, through seeking to negotiate a veterinary agreement with the EU to massively reduce the need for checks, helping make food cheaper and our businesses more competitive.\"\n\nIn a statement the government said the flat-rate charge was at the \"bottom end of the range which we consulted with industry on\".\n\nIt said the charge was designed to \"recover the costs of operating our world-class border facilities where essential biosecurity checks will protect our food supply, farmers and environment against costly disease outbreaks entering the UK through the short straits\".\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The charges follow extensive consultation with industry and a cap has been set specifically to help smaller businesses. We are committed to supporting businesses of all sizes and across all sectors as they adapt to new border checks and maintaining the smooth flow of imported goods.\"", "Nick's home has become an island during floods\n\nHomeowners risk complacency, expense and trauma unless they consider fitting simple flood protection measures, a new campaign will claim.\n\nThe Environment Agency and others say millions of UK homes are at risk, and families can be forced out of a flood-hit home for a year for it to dry out.\n\nThey say relatively cheap upgrades, including toilet bungs and air brick covers, can help cut damage and costs.\n\nForecasters say flooding in the UK will become more intense and more frequent.\n\nProtection has saved one couple's home despite nine floods in four years.\n\nNick Lupton, who lives next to the River Severn in Worcestershire, said he and his wife Annie had never had to claim on insurance, having kept their house dry despite torrents of water outside.\n\nNick Lupton says the investment is worthwhile\n\n\"We bought the house with our eyes wide open,\" said the retired engineer.\n\n\"We have added a little bit to the mitigation the previous owners put in place which had worked very well, which makes our life a little bit easier.\"\n\nThe property, part of which dates back to the 17th Century, was once the river ferryboat's inn. When it was a pub, the sound of floating beer barrels in the cellar was a sign of the rising water.\n\nNow, double flood barriers in front of the doors and pumps under the floors keep the muddy overflowing river water back. The couple are remortgaging to pay for a flood wall to circle the property, anticipating raising the value of their home as a result.\n\nNot everything is expensive. A \u00a35 sewage bung has saved them from having to bail out the toilets every 40 minutes during the night during a flood.\n\nSuch measures will be central to the launch of the Be Flood Smart campaign on Monday by the Environment Agency and Flood Re - a scheme designed to provide affordable insurance for flood-risk homes.\n\n\"I can't stress enough just how horrendous flooding is, so any action people can take to avoid the turmoil is a good investment,\" said Andy Bord, chief executive of Flood Re, who likened the safety measures to locks to prevent burglary.\n\n\"Insurance covers a lot, but it can't make flooding any less traumatic and protect those really important sentimental items at the heart of your home.\"\n\nToilet bungs are pumped up to avoid sewage backing up during a flood\n\nJust days after the latest set of floods hit the UK, he is urging homeowners refurbishing their homes to consider measures such as waterproof tiling and covers over the holes in air bricks.

Summer rain, when the ground is hard, can create flash floods in urban areas.\n\nShe said that the risk of flooding in areas that had not suffered before could lead to some complacency, but technology was helping to highlight the risks.\n\nEmma Brown says computer modelling can alert those at risk\n\n\"State-of-the-art computer models mean we can pinpoint the homes and businesses that are most likely to be flooded.

The significance of water safety and education regarding appropriate actions during emergencies cannot be overstated.\n\nThe report highlights that almost half of deaths happen in June, July and August.\n\nMs Newell urged everyone to consider what more they could do to help children and young people enjoy the water safely.\n\n\"Take an extra five minutes before you go to the beach or before you go to the river just so you exactly what to do,\" said Ms Newell.\n\n\"It's knowing who to call depending on where you are and what to look for.\"\n\nThe RNLI reported a 46% increase in incidents across the 39 beaches watched over by lifeguards in Wales.\n\nLifeguards in Wales helped 2,315 people in 2022, an increase of nearly 40%.\n\nSwansea lifeguard supervisor, Thomas John, said the huge tidal range in the Bristol Channel was an issue.\n\nZac died in hospital a day after being rescued\n\n\"There's loads of safety information online, getting the weather is very accessible on a mobile phone, getting tide times is very accessible but I think people... need to know those things before visiting the coast,\" he said.\n\nHe also urged people to float on their backs if they got into trouble.\n\nWater Safety Wales chairman, Chris Cousens, said it was important to educate families to prevent child deaths.\n\nHe said: \"It is sobering to reveal that almost half of the children and young people were taking part in activities where they had not intended entering the water, just like Zac when the fatal incident occurred.\"", "Then-Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Arif Alvi watch Pakistan's Air Force fighter jets perform during the Pakistan Day parade in 2022\n\nFor many years, Pakistan's military establishment believed that in Imran Khan they had found a saviour for the country. But, writes author and journalist Mohammed Hanif, after only a year out of power he is threatening to become their nemesis - and the military is using all its might to save itself from Khan's wrath.\n\nAs Imran Khan and his party face a country-wide crackdown, Pakistan seems to have come to a standstill.\n\nThe nation is facing crippling inflation and the hottest summer in history, with constant power breakdowns, and yet the whole country is consumed with what Khan will do next, and what our military establishment can do to contain him.\n\nAfter he was removed from power more than a year ago, his supporters said Khan was their \"red line\" and that if he was arrested, the country would burn. After a number of failed attempts, a contingent of paramilitary forces did just that on 9 May.\n\nThe country didn't quite burn, but Khan's supporters took the fight to military cantonments.\n\nThe army's headquarters, General Headquarters (GHQ), probably the most secure place in Pakistan, was breached and people trampled on the signboards with military logos.\n\nA senior general's house in Lahore was ransacked - Khan's supporters videoed themselves while setting his furniture and cars on fire. One protester walked away wearing the general's uniform, another made away with his pet peacock.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIt had all the symbols of a revolution, except that it wasn't. Imran Khan was first loved by the army, then shunned by them, now his supporters were settling their scores. It was less of a revolution and more of a lovers' spat.\n\nIt's almost a rite of passage for every prime minister to fall out with the Pakistan army.\n\nThe country's first elected Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged, his daughter Benazir Bhutto was dismissed twice as a prime minister and her assassination, by a teenage suicide bomber, was never fully investigated. Nawaz Sharif was dismissed, jailed, exiled - now again in exile, he rules by proxy via his younger brother Shehbaz, but still can't return to the country.\n\nAfter Imran Khan's arrest his supporters did what no mainstream political force has done before. Instead of taking to the streets in protest, they invaded the cantonment areas and showed the citizens how Pakistani generals live: in huge mansions with swimming pools and acres of lawns where peacocks roam.\n\nA house in cantonment area in Lahore which was set on fire on 9 May\n\nJust before he was picked up, Khan singled out Pakistan Army's chief of staff General Asim Munir as the man trying to crush his political party.\n\nBefore that he had called the former army chief General Bajwa, who was instrumental in bringing and sustaining him in power, a traitor. He also named an ISI general for being responsible for a failed assassination on him. He and his supporters repeatedly called the accused general Dirty Harry in public rallies.\n\nMany Pakistani politicians in the past have named and shamed the army as an institution but Pakistanis are not used to seeing the images of a Corps Commander's house on fire, women protesters rattling the gates of GHQ, and the statues of decorated soldiers being toppled.\n\nThis was exactly what the current government, a coalition of almost all the political parties opposed to Khan, needed to hit back.\n\nThe government has been trying to get out of an impending national election, which according to many opinion polls Khan is likely to win. Now many government politicians are calling for an outright ban on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) - its name means Movement for Justice.\n\nImran Khan addressing the media from his home in Lahore last week\n\nIn the past, reprisals against politicians who have taken on the army have been swift.\n\nAli Wazir, an elected assembly member who called out the army's sympathies for the Taliban, was in jail for two years and was not even allowed to attend the National Assembly. Thousands of political workers from Balochistan have been forcibly disappeared and no Pakistani court or mainstream political party is interested in their plight.\n\nSo how come Imran Khan, despite facing dozens of charges, is still roaming free?\n\nThe perception is that he has polarised the establishment itself. There are officers and their families within the army who are enamoured by him. There is the judiciary which has been extending his bail. After spending one day in a lock-up, Pakistan's highest judge called him to court, said \"happy to see you\", and put him in a state guest house. The next day another judge released him.\n\nPolice commandos escort former Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan as he arrives at the high court in Islamabad\n\nImran Khan has won over a massive constituency in Pakistan that abhorred politics and politicians before he came along. His message of clean governance and justice has popular appeal - although when Khan was in power corruption actually increased and he put many of his political opponents in jail.\n\nBut his removal from power has emboldened his supporters, many of whom are women and young people who have never voted before and never attended a political rally.\n\nThey are often accused of political naivety, taking an ahistorical view of the current crisis and claiming that what is happening now has never happened in the history of Pakistan. They consider themselves part of a reformist movement that wants to rid the country of all corrupt politicians.\n\nLike Khan, they once loved the army. Now they hold the army responsible for everything.\n\nDespite Khan's repeated attacks on the army leadership, many believe that he doesn't really want to curtail the army's powers, he just wants the generals to love and support him and his party like they did before.\n\nBut in the aftermath of the riots on 9 May, the army high command seems to think that enough is enough. The current army chief has called it a \"black day in the history of Pakistan\".\n\nImran Khan might have ushered in a new kind of populist politics in Pakistan, but the army is using the same playbook to bring him down that it has used against his predecessors.\n\nDozens of corruption cases, mass arrests and a clear message that by attacking the army, it is Khan who has crossed the red line. The army has also tried to win hearts and minds by releasing a song saluting army martyrs - and celebrating a \"respect for martyrs\" day in response to the attacks on military installations on 9 May (critics point out that no soldiers were martyred that day, just a posh mansion ransacked by an angry crowd).\n\nMain roads in the major cities are lined with posters praising the army and pledging eternal loyalty. The army has also brought into play religious parties that had attacked it in the past - they were out on the streets last week, declaring their love for the army.\n\nPeople attend a candlelight vigil in Quetta on \"Pakistan Martyrs Day\" on Thursday\n\nPakistan's army is also looking within its own ranks for Khan sympathisers.\n\nOne woman that law enforcement agencies were pursuing for her alleged involvement in the 9 May riots is the fashion designer turned political activist Khadija Shah - who is also the granddaughter of a former army chief and a third-generation cantonment child.\n\nShe denies committing any crime, but it is clear Khan has mesmerised some of the \"army brats\" to such an extent that they are willing to set their own house on fire. By arresting Shah and putting her behind bars, the army has sent a clear signal to army families to stay away from Khan's politics.\n\nThe army has also tried to dismantle Khan's PTI party through mass arrests and by deciding to hold military trials of workers and leaders who were involved in cantonment attacks.\n\nMany of Khan's senior party leaders are under immense pressure to leave his PTI party. Some have left, claiming that they can't condone Khan's confrontational approach towards the Pakistan army.\n\nHistorically, Pakistan's army has always managed to have its way when confronted with civilians. Imran Khan has asked his workers to choose death over a life of slavery. In this deadlock, it's the ordinary Pakistanis who have suffered - and continue to suffer.\n\nBritish-Pakistani author and journalist Mohammed Hanif is the former head of the BBC's Urdu service, and the author of several plays and novels, including the award-winning A Case of Exploding Mangoes and Our Lady of Alice Bhatti.", "Adam Price says he no longer had the support of his party\n\nAdam Price has quit as Plaid Cymru leader after a report found misogyny, harassment and bullying in the party.\n\nNorth Wales Senedd member Llyr Gruffydd will take over as interim leader, with a new leader in place in the summer, the party has said.\n\nIt follows months of difficulties including allegations of a sexual assault made against a senior staff member, and a toxic working culture.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Price said he no longer had the \"united support\" of his colleagues.\n\nHe said he wanted to resign in the wake of the report's findings, but was initially persuaded not to quit.\n\n\"You have my personal assurance that I will continue to serve my country, my constituents and our party with determination and enthusiasm,\" he said in a letter to party chairman, Marc Jones.\n\nOn Thursday Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said discussions on his co-operation agreement with Plaid will take place \"in light of recent developments\"\n\nHe thanked Mr Price \"for the constructive way the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru have worked together\".\n\nThe resignation announcement was made following a meeting of the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), late on Wednesday night.\n\nOne source from the meeting said some members raised the possibility of Adam Price remaining in post.\n\nBut it was considered untenable given the seriousness of the findings of the review.\n\nPlaid's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Price was not asked to resign in the wake of the \"toxic culture\" report because \"stability\" was needed to implement its recommendations.\n\nInterim Plaid Cymru leader Llyr Gruffydd has been in the Senedd since 2011\n\nSpeaking on the Today programme, Liz Saville Roberts said: \"Effective leadership is about balancing conflicting demands.\n\n\"What we felt strongly was that we needed a collegiate approach within the party because it (the report) cuts across all aspects of the party and it requires a change of culture\".\n\n\"In order to do that we would need stability\".\n\nShe also told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that Mr Price had to go because he had become a \"distraction\".\n\nShe ruled herself out of a leadership contest, saying any new leader would have to be an elected member in the Senedd.\n\n\"I'm an MP in Westminster so that's done and dusted,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Adam Price apologised last week but said the damning report points to a \"collective failure\" across the party\n\nMr Gruffydd's appointment as interim leader was agreed at a meeting of the party's Senedd members on Thursday and will need to be rubber-stamped by Plaid Cymru's National Council on Saturday.\n\nHe will not stand in the forthcoming leadership contest\n\nMr Gruffydd said he was \"grateful to the Plaid Cymru Senedd group\" for the nomination and thanked Mr Price for his \"vision, commitment, and dedication\".\n\nPlaid Cymru is the third largest party in the Welsh Parliament, with 12 Members of the Senedd and three MPs in Westminster.\n\nThe pro-independence party is in a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government, which means they help them govern.\n\nMr Price was elected party leader in 2018, when he ousted Leanne Wood.\n\nWelsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: \"I have no doubt Adam Price's departure is a moment of personal sadness for him.\n\n\"Following the recent report into the culture within their party, it became clear Plaid Cymru politicians no longer had confidence in his leadership, so his departure became inevitable.\"\n\nFor the converted, the die-hard believers, it wasn't meant to be like this.\n\nAdam Price was touted by many in Plaid Cymru as a \"once in a generation\" politician who could overcome the party's many electoral barriers.\n\nWhen he challenged his predecessor for the leadership in 2018, he said only he could \"create the momentum\" Plaid needed to become Wales' main party of government and install him as first minister.\n\nAnd yet, there was no great advance at the following Senedd election - Plaid remains in third place behind the Welsh Conservatives.\n\nSupporters will say it was an election like no other, one focused almost entirely on the public's broadly favourable opinion of the Welsh Labour government's handling of the pandemic.\n\nIt is clear, though, that some of the sheen had faded and in terms of public support, the party remains no further forward under Adam Price's leadership.\n\nAs it nears its 100th birthday celebrations, Plaid Cymru will seek its 11th leader with many of the perennial questions about its purpose, its lack of reach beyond the heartlands and its relationship with Welsh Labour likely to be raised.\n\nBut it is the drip, drip of negative stories over the last year, culminating in a damning report that found a toxic culture within the party that meant Adam Price's position was no longer tenable.\n\nAddressing those major issues will be his successor's primary focus.\n\nSince last year Plaid Cymru has been dogged by claims of a toxic culture in the party, and it emerged last November that an allegation of sexual assault had been made against a senior member of staff.\n\nSeparately, a serious allegation was also made about the conduct of a Member of the Senedd, Rhys ab Owen, who is now suspended from the Senedd group pending an investigation.\n\nThe party asked Nerys Evans, a lobbyist and former Plaid assembly member, to hold a review last December.\n\nHer working group's report said Plaid needed to \"detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny\".\n\nIt said too many instances of bad behaviour were tolerated, and said an anonymous survey of staff and elected members highlighted examples \"of sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination\".\n\nMr Price admitted the document left Plaid Cymru \"harmed and tarnished\". He apologised, but refused to quit.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Price said: \"On receiving the report, I informed you that I felt morally bound to step down as leader of the party in recognition of our collective failure.\"\n\n\"You counselled against my resignation as you felt it would make it more difficult to achieve progress in implementing the recommendations.\"\n\nHe said he was \"persuaded by the argument that my stepping down would be an abdication of responsibility\".\n\nBut he added: \"It is now clear I no longer have the united support of my colleagues that would be necessary to follow this course to fruition.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said: \"I want to thank Adam Price for the constructive way the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru have worked together to develop and implement the co-operation agreement. These shared priorities are making a real difference to people across Wales.\n\n\"The co-operation agreement is an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru - not between individuals. There will be discussions about the agreement in light of recent developments.\"", "About 3% of families in the UK - at least 2.1 million people - used a food bank in the year to March 2022, according to official figures.\n\nThat rose to about one in nine (11%) for families receiving state income-related benefits.\n\nThose in the north of England and Scotland were most likely to have used a food bank in the previous 12 months compared to the rest of the UK.\n\nThese are the first Department for Work and Pensions figures on food bank use.\n\nThe data was collected between April 2021 and March 2022, with people asked if they had been to a food bank in the last 12 months and last 30 days. So the figures cover some of the pandemic but miss most of the energy price crisis, which hit in April 2022.\n\nIt comes amid the continuing cost-of-living crisis, with prices rising more than expected, according to new inflation figures released this week.\n\nAsked if they had used a food bank within the last 30 days, about 1% of families (at least 600,000 people) said yes - rising to about 3% for families on benefits.\n\nSome 4% of families in Scotland and the north of England had used a food bank within the 12-month period, while 3% had in Wales, the West Midlands and south-east of England.\n\nThe figure fell to 2% for Northern Ireland, the East of England, East Midlands and south-west of England.\n\nWhile the official figures only show food bank use up to early last year, statistics from food poverty charity the Trussell Trust have shown an increase in usage between April 2022 and September 2022, up to just above the levels seen at the start of the pandemic.\n\nBetween 1 April 2022 and 30 September 2022, food banks in the charity's UK-wide network distributed almost 1.3 million food parcels - a rise of 52% compared to the same period to September 2019.\n\nHeather Buckingham, director of policy and research at the Trussell Trust, told BBC News the figures were \"deeply concerning\" but \"sadly not surprising\".\n\nShe called on politicians to guarantee that the basic rate of Universal Credit was calculated so it would always at least cover the cost of essentials.\n\nA single person receiving Universal Credit gets \u00a335 a week short of the amount the charity thinks is needed to afford the very basic essentials, she said.\n\nHouseholds where there were people with disabilities and single-parent families were overrepresented among those needing to use food banks, she added.\n\nFood banks receive donated non-perishable food and other essential items which volunteers then sort into parcels which can be given to those in need.\n\nCare professionals such as health visitors, school staff and social workers can identify people who need support and issue them with a food bank voucher so they can collect a food package.\n\nOther figures published by the DWP showed the number of people living in poverty in the UK has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn total, 14.4 million people were estimated to be in relative low-income households - with below 60% of average household income - in the year to March 2022, up from the 13.4 million in March 2021 and close to the 14.5 million the year before, as the Covid pandemic hit.\n\nSome 4.2 million children were estimated to be living in poverty in the year to March 2022, a rise from 3.9 million the previous year and just below the 4.3 million in March 2020.\n\nBecca Lyon, head of child poverty at Save the Children UK, said the \"grim figures\" proved families were \"still very much in the depths of a crisis\".\n\n\"Families need a proper benefits system that protects them from hardship, and means children can grow up without having to know what the inside of a food bank looks like,\" she said.\n\nBarnado's chief executive Lynn Perry said the number of children in poverty was \"unacceptable\" for the sixth largest economy in the world and wants free school meals extended to all primary school children in England.\n\nAction for Children accused ministers of knowing how to help, due to the action taken during the pandemic, but \"choosing not to do it\".\n\nAndrew Forsey, national director of Feeding Britain, called for the government to reduce the rate of monthly deductions from Universal Credit - made to repay debts - describing them as a poverty tax.\n\nA government spokeswoman said it was committed to \"eradicating poverty and supporting those in need\", adding there were nearly two million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2009/10.\n\n\"These latest figures reflect the country coming out of the pandemic and accompanying rising prices, which we have since helped to address with record levels of support via cost of living payments to over eight million households, and plans to provide up to \u00a31,350 of direct payments for the most vulnerable over this year and next,\" she said.\n\nDoes your family use a food bank?

He responded to a failed 2016 coup by dramatically increasing his powers and cracking down on dissent.\n\nLeading Kurdish politicians have been jailed and other opposition figures threatened with a political ban.\n\nBut this election was the opposition's biggest hope of unseating the president yet.\n\nIncreasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for rampant inflation of 44%, and academics say the real rate is far higher than that.\n\nHe and his ruling AK Party were widely criticised for their response to the double earthquakes in February that left millions of Turks homeless in 11 provinces.\n\nAnd yet most of the cities which are considered Erdogan strongholds still gave him 60% of the vote.\n\nHis party is rooted in political Islam, but he has forged an alliance with the ultra-nationalist MHP.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, 74, is an unlikely choice of candidate to unseat the president.\n\nHe is seen as a mild-mannered and bookish opponent and presided over a string of election defeats at the helm of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\nHe polled well in the first round, taking Mr Erdogan to his first run-off, but not as well as the opinion polls had indicated he would.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu secured the backing of six opposition parties, including the nationalist Good party and four smaller groups, which include two former Erdogan allies one of whom co-founded the AK Party.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu has agreed that the leaders of his alliance will all share the role of vice president\n\nHe also has the support of Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, whose co-leader described the elections as \"the most crucial in Turkey's history\".\n\nHis biggest hope of snatching victory from a president buoyant after his first-round lead lies in increasing the support of both nationalist and Kurdish voters. A difficult feat when Turkey's nationalists want the next president to take a tougher line on Kurdish militants.\n\nIn the lead-up to the second round, he made a clear pitch to nationalist voters, banging his fists on the table and vowing to send home 3.5 million Syrian refugees. This was already his policy, but now he has decided to make a big point of it.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu's selection was not universally popular as the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara were potentially stronger candidates. Both are party colleagues who took control of Turkey's two biggest cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994.\n\nHe is also a member of Turkey's Alevi minority, and when the opposition candidate drew attention to his roots Mr Erdogan accused him of seeking to exploit it.\n\nHis Nation Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament.\n\nThe leaders of the other five members of the alliance have agreed to take on the roles of vice-president. But even if they were to win the presidency, the Erdogan alliance won a majority in parliament on 14 May and would make reforms very difficult.\n\nTurnout in the first round was already very high at almost 89% among voters in Turkey.\n\nIf Mr Kilicdaroglu is to make up the 2.5 million votes between him and President Erdogan, he will need to win over voters who backed ultranationalist candidate Sinan Ogan who came third in the first round with 2.8 million votes.\n\nThat task was made even harder when Mr Ogan endorsed the president.\n\nHis demand is for a tougher stance on tackling Kurdish militants and returning Syrian refugees.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu had already adopted a more strident tone on Syrians since the first round, promising to \"send away\" all refugees as soon as he came to power.\n\nReacting to Mr Ogan's decision to back his rival, he said the vote was now a referendum: \"We are coming to save this country from terrorism and refugees.\"\n\nPresident Erdogan said he had made no deals with Mr Ogan: 450,000 refugees had already returned home and the plan was to send back another million, he said.\n\nThe ruling AK Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has forged an alliance with the nationalist MHP and together they have secured a majority of 322 seats in the 600-seat parliament, down on five years ago.\n\nParties tend to form alliances because they need a minimum of 7% support to enter parliament.\n\nThe six-party opposition wants to change that but its Nation Alliance only managed 212 seats.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party ran under the banner of the Green Left to avoid a potential election ban, and came third with 61 seats.\n\nUnder the Erdogan reforms, it is now the president who chooses the government, so there is no prime minister.\n\nUnder Turkey's revamped constitution allowing only two terms as president, Mr Erdogan would have to stand down in 2028 if he won the 28 May run-off. There are currently no plans for a successor.\n\nHe has already served two terms but Turkey's YSK election board ruled that his first term should be seen as starting not in 2014 but in 2018, when the new presidential system began with elections for parliament and president on the same day.\n\nOpposition politicians had earlier asked the YSK to block his candidacy.\n\nUnder an Erdogan presidency, Turkey can expect increased control of state institutions and the media and a greater crackdown on dissent. Inflation is likely to remain high because of his preference for low interest rates.\n\nInternationally, he could continue to resist Sweden's bid to join Nato and will paint himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu and his allies want to remove the president's right to veto legislation, cutting the post's ties to political parties and making it electable every seven years.\n\nHe wants to bring inflation down to 10% and send 3.5 million Syrian refugees home. President Erdogan has promised to speed up the voluntary repatriation of a million Syrians.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu also wants kickstart Turkey's decades-long bid to join the European Union and restore \"mutual trust\" with the US, after years of fractious relations during the Erdogan years.", "The cost of detaining and deporting people arriving in the UK in small boats under planned new legislation could hit \u00a36bn over the next two years, internal government projections say.\n\nThe Illegal Migration Bill is currently going through Parliament.\n\nThe BBC understands the Home Office estimates it will have to spend between \u00a33bn and \u00a36bn on detention facilities, and ongoing accommodation and removals.\n\nIt gives ministers the power to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally.\n\nThese migrants would be barred from claiming asylum here.\n\nThe government insists it needs to act as record numbers of people are arriving in small boats and the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels is running at almost \u00a37m a day.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made tackling the issue one of his key priorities - but the bill has encountered opposition from within the Conservative party and has been strongly criticised in the House of Lords, where it is currently being debated.\n\nMinisters have so far not revealed any costs linked to the bill or given any indication of the scale of investment it requires.\n\nBut one senior government source described it as one of the main pressures on public spending.\n\nThe Treasury is backing the policy, but there is concern among insiders that costs associated with the controversial bill are escalating.\n\nHome Office sources acknowledged that the bill's implementation would be expensive and complex, with one admitting that getting the whole process working would be a \"major logistical challenge\".\n\nMore than 45,000 people crossed the English Channel last year on small boats - currently the UK has the capacity to detain around 2,000 people for immigration purposes and work has begun to significantly scale this up.\n\nWhitehall sources stressed there were many variables and the purpose of the bill was also to act as a deterrent.\n\nThe Home Office hopes the number of people being detained, and therefore the costs, will come down over time, but Treasury insiders worry that the deterrent effect has not been reliably modelled.\n\nOne Home Office source close to the legislation admitted the deterrent effect was an \"unknown factor\" that could not be predicted.\n\nJon Featonby, chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, said: \"The Home Office is clearly aware that so-called deterrence measures simply don't work, and it is preparing to detain thousands of desperate people who will end up on our shores in search of protection. Until refugees fleeing violence and persecution are given a safe pathway to seek asylum in our country, they will continue to risk their lives to get here.\n\n\"Instead of moving forward with this hugely expensive and unworkable crackdown on refugees seeking safety in the UK, the government should be focusing on creating a system that protects the right to claim asylum and that prioritises both compassion and control.\"\n\nRob McNeil, deputy director of Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said costs were already \"very, very high\" and that if asylum claims were processed faster there would be fewer people in the system.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast the question is whether the proposed bill would deter people from arriving in the UK in the first place.\n\nResponding to the figures, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The Conservatives are in total chaos on asylum and their new bill is a sham that will make the soaring costs far worse.\"\n\nThe government says it will publish its economic impact assessment of the bill in due course.\n\nUnder the proposals in the Illegal Migration Bill, anyone who arrives in the UK on an unauthorised boat across the English Channel would be detained before being removed within weeks, either to their home country or another country deemed safe.\n\nA plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda to make their claims is still facing legal challenges in the courts.\n\nIf the Illegal Migration Bill becomes law, it will apply retrospectively to anyone who arrived in the UK illegally after 7 March 2023.\n\nIn the short term, there would still be a legacy system in place in parallel, dealing with the claims of those who arrived on small boats before that date.\n\nThe Home Office says the annual cost of the current asylum system has reached \u00a33bn a year.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"Our Illegal Migration Bill will help to stop the boats by making sure people smugglers and illegal migrants understand that coming to the UK illegally will result in detention and swift removal - only then will they be deterred from making these dangerous journeys in the first place.\"", "Supporters of New York City's weight discrimination bill rally in New York\n\nNew York City has passed a bill outlawing discrimination based on weight, joining a growing movement in the US to make size a protected trait on par with race and gender.\n\nMore than 40% of American adults are considered obese and studies show weight stigma is pervasive.\n\nThe bias can bring sharp costs, such as lower wages, especially for women.\n\nCity Councilman Shaun Abreu said weight discrimination was \"a silent burden people have had to carry\".\n\nDuring public hearings, supporters cited difficulty navigating seating at restaurants and theatres, getting turned away by landlords, and butting up against weight limits on the city's bike sharing programme.\n\nCouncilman Abreu, who sponsored the bill, said he became more aware of the issue when he gained more than 40lb (18.1kg) during lockdown and saw a shift in how he was treated. He said the lack of protections had amplified the problems people face.\n\n\"They're being discriminated against with no recourse and society saying that's perfectly fine,\" he said.\n\nThe measure is expected to be signed into law by New York's mayor later this month. The effort received widespread support, passing 44-5, despite scepticism in some quarters.\n\nNew York City council's minority leader, Joseph Borelli, who is a Republican, told the New York Times he was worried the law would empower New Yorkers \"to sue anyone and everything\".\n\n\"I'm overweight but I'm not a victim. No-one should feel bad for me except my struggling shirt buttons,\" he said.\n\nMichigan has barred workplace discrimination based on weight since 1976 and a handful of other cities, including San Francisco and Washington DC, have legislation on the books.\n\nState-level bills have now been introduced in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Jersey.\n\nThe efforts follow a dramatic increase in obesity rates over the past 20 years.\n\nTegan Lecheler, advocacy director for the National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance, which worked with Councilman Abreu on the New York City bill, said she hoped the measure would \"encourage a larger conversation of framing this beyond health\".\n\n\"It's not a health issue. It's a civil rights issue,\" she said. \"This is really about if people are safe and protected and have the right to be in spaces.\"\n\nNew York's human rights law already bars discrimination in housing, the workplace and public accommodation based on 27 characteristics, including age, marital status, disability and national origin.\n\nThe bill adds weight and height to that list, while including exceptions for jobs in which weight and height are a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" or where there is a public health and safety concern.\n\nCouncilman Abreu said he hoped the move by the largest city in the country would encourage other cities and states to follow suit.\n\n\"We want this bill to send a message to everybody that you matter, regardless of if you're above or below average weight,\" he said. \"That's why we pushed this.\"", "Protesters hold up placards saying \"not my king\" in Trafalgar Square\n\nMet Police officers have arrested anti-monarchy protesters in central London ahead of the King's Coronation.\n\nThe leader of anti-monarchy group Republic has been arrested and the force said it had detained multiple people in the City of Westminster.\n\nThey are held on suspicion of breaching the peace, conspiracy to cause public nuisance and possessing articles to cause criminal damage, the force said.\n\nRepublic said hundreds of their placards had also been seized.\n\n\"A significant police operation is under way in central London,\" the force said on Twitter.\n\nFootage on social media showed officers using their powers under the new Public Order Act.\n\nChief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, Graham Smith, was among those apprehended in St Martin's Lane near Trafalgar Square.\n\nPictures showed protesters in yellow \"Not My King\" T-shirts, including Mr Smith, having their details taken.\n\nIn one video an officer said: \"I'm not going to get into a conversation about that, they are under arrest, end of.\"\n\nProtesters from climate protest group Just Stop Oil are apprehended by police officers in the crowd\n\nThe Met confirmed that four people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on St Martin's Lane and that lock-on devices were seized.\n\nThe force also said they made a number of breaching-the-peace arrests in the area of Carlton House Terrace and a further three arrests in the Wellington Arch area on suspicion of possessing articles to cause criminal damage.\n\nMatt Turnbull, one of those arrested from Republic, said the straps holding the placards had been \"misconstrued\" as something that could be used for locking on.\n\nNew legislation passed this week means it is illegal to prepare to lock-on to things like street furniture.\n\nJust Stop Oil said that a protester had been arrested in Piccadilly on their way to the Mall.\n\nFootage from the scene also showed about 15 protesters being handcuffed and taken away by a heavy police presence.\n\nOn Wednesday the Met said that it would have an \"extremely low threshold\" for protests during the coronation celebrations, and that demonstrators could expect \"swift action\".\n\nRepublic activist Luke Whiting, 26, said: \"Six Republic members have been arrested...

He will formally make a plea later this month and is facing up to five years in prison.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC Eye investigations team last year, Mr Macartney confessed to his role in the torture network, describing himself as the \"king of this demented world\".\n\n\"I was the man,\" he said. \"You want to see monkeys get messed up? I could bring it to you.\"\n\nMr Macartney also described the moment he joined his first Telegram monkey group.\n\n\"They had a poll set up,\" he said. \"Do you want a hammer involved? Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\"\n\nThe resulting videos were \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen\", Mr Macartney said, and yet he went on to become a key player in the monkey torture groups.\n\nThe BBC understands that more charges are expected to follow soon for other key players in the monkey torture network. At least 20 people were placed under investigation last year globally, following the BBC's investigation.\n\nThree participants have already been charged in the US, including Mr Macartney. Two torturers were arrested and jailed in Indonesia, and three women have been arrested in the UK, two of whom have been charged.\n\nHolly LeGresley, 37, of Kidderminster and Adriana Orme, 55, of Upton-upon Severn were charged last month with publishing an obscene article and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.\n\nMs LeGresley and Ms Orme were high-profile members of the online torture groups. Ms LeGresley, who went by the screen name \"The Immolator\", was a moderator in a group run by Mr Macartney and was involved in commissioning some of the most extreme videos.\n\nIn the US, two others have been charged with the same counts as Mr Macartney.\n\nDavid Christopher Noble, 48, a former US Air Force officer who was previously court-martialed and dismissed from the military, and Nicole Devilbiss, 35. They are both facing up to five years in prison.", "Interest rates are expected to rise again after UK inflation remained much higher than expected for the fourth month in a row.\n\nInflation, which measures the rate of rising prices, stuck at 8.7% in May.\n\nThe shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.\n\nIn a heated exchange at PMQs, Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed over who was to blame.\n\nSir Keir accused the Conservatives of being to blame for \"the mortgage catastrophe\". But Prime Minister Mr Sunak hit back, citing \"the global macroeconomic situation\" and saying it had spent \"tens of billions\" supporting people with the cost of living.\n\nInterest rates are widely expected to rise by 0.25% to 4.75% on Thursday but some suggest they could now go up to 5%. Rising rates mean homeowners are facing big increases in mortgage payments.\n\nInfluential think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned higher rates would result in a drop of more than 20% in disposable income for 1.4 million mortgage holders.\n\nKaren Ward, a member of chancellor Jeremy Hunt's economic advisory council, said the Bank had \"been too hesitant\" in its interest rate rises so far and called on it to \"create a recession\" to curb soaring prices.\n\n\"It's only when companies feel nervous about the future that they will think 'Well, maybe I won't put through that price rise', or workers, when they're a little bit less confident about their job, think 'Oh, I won't push my boss for that higher pay,'\" she told the BBC's Today programme.\n\nBut Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, a wholesale food supplier said increasing interest rates was \"not the right thing to do\".\n\n\"It's stifling the economy. They need to look at other ways to support businesses so they can weather the storm,\" he said.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy.\"\n\nThe Bank is tasked with keeping inflation at 2% but the current inflation rate is four times higher than this. It has been steadily raising interest rates since the end of 2021. This makes it more expensive to borrow money and theoretically encourages people to borrow less and spend less, meaning price rises should ease.\n\nHomeowners - a third of adults in the UK - are facing large increases in repayments when fixed-term deals come to an end. First-time buyers are also at risk of being priced out of the market as lending conditions become tighter.\n\nThe average two-year fixed rate mortgage on Wednesday hit 6.15%, while five-year deals were 5.79%.\n\nIn May, increases to flight fares, second-hand car prices, live music events and video games all drove prices higher.\n\nOne analyst said it was possible the release of Nintendo's new Zelda had helped boost the sale of computer games.\n\nSo-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month rising at its fastest rate for 31 years.\n\nEconomists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling,\n\nGrant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which produces figures on the UK economy, said the increase was being driven by rising service prices in cafes, restaurants and hotels.\n\n\"That's probably driven, at least in part, by the increase we've seen in wages,\" he added.\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, also said rising core inflation suggested firms might be passing on rising costs from higher wage bills to consumers,\" she said.\n\nUK wages have risen at their fastest rate in 20 years, excluding the pandemic, but are still lagging behind the rate of inflation.\n\nPay failing to keep up with price rises has led to many households come under financial pressure in recent months.\n\nFood price inflation, which is the rate at which prices for groceries have risen compared to the year before, was 18.3% in May, down slightly from 19% in April.\n\nSergio Ronga, who owns Nanninella Pizzeria in Brighton, said he had to put his prices up as a result of higher costs.\n\nHe said costs had soared for his ingredients with tomatoes almost doubling in price, as well as flour rising by 60% and cheese jumping by 50%.\n\nSergio Ronga has seen his costs sharply increase\n\nSarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said while food price inflation had eased, it was still at a level that \"causes agony at the tills\".\n\n\"Costs have risen so far and so fast that we're not going to see prices drop back to the level we were used to. In many cases we won't actually see them fall at all: they'll just get more expensive at a slower rate,\" she said.\n\nSeparately, figures also released on Wednesday revealed that national debt was greater than the UK's economic output for the first time since 1961.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nManchester City celebrated a third successive Premier League title triumph with victory over Chelsea in a relaxed party atmosphere at Etihad Stadium.\n\nCity were confirmed as champions without even playing after Nottingham Forest's win against Arsenal on Saturday, allowing manager Pep Guardiola to make nine changes from the side that thrashed Real Madrid to reach the Champions League final.\n\nErling Haaland was rested but Julian Alvarez provided the cutting edge in his absence with a clinical finish to put City ahead after 12 minutes, as their jubilant fans basked in warm sunshine waiting for the trophy presentations and celebrations.\n\nChelsea had some of the better chances as the game went on, with City's deputy keeper Stefan Ortega saving from Raheem Sterling when clean through and Conor Gallagher heading against the post.\n\nKalvin Phillips headed against the woodwork for City as they closed out another win in the relentless run that has brought them the title and the chance of a Treble, with the FA Cup final at Wembley and Champions League final in Istanbul to come.\n\u2022 None All the reaction to Sunday's games\n\u2022 None 'Man City are two games away from immortality'\n\nThe hosts played with the pressure off after the title was secured and manager Guardiola was able to give members of his shadow squad game time on an occasion where most fans were simply waiting for the final whistle to hail their heroes.\n\nGuardiola's selection gave an illustration of the vast resources of talent he has at his disposal with simply a glance at City's substitutes' bench.\n\nHaaland, Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, John Stones, Jack Grealish, Rodri, Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias and goalkeeper Ederson were not included from the start.\n\nHas there ever been a more talented bench than that one?\n\nThey are all likely to be restored when those two big finals come around but it was a demonstration, if indeed it were needed, of what other teams must overcome if they are to loosen the stranglehold City have domestically and which now gives them the chance of their first Champions League.\n\nGoalscorer Alvarez may have worked in Haaland's shadow for much of the season but what an acquisition he has been and what a season he has had, with the chance to add the Treble to his World Cup win with Argentina.\n\nThe Premier League is Manchester City's once more - now it is on to Wembley and Istanbul.\n\nChelsea must be ready for reset\n\nChelsea may have had some decent chances here and only lost by a single goal to the newly crowned champions, but they carry all the appearance of a team and club that cannot wait for an abject and miserable season to end.\n\nFrank Lampard is seeing out time on the touchline before making his second departure as manager, while Chelsea's players await the arrival of incoming Mauricio Pochettino to discover what the future has in store.\n\nThere is talent within this squad but they, and Chelsea as a club, have lacked direction under the new co-ownership of Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali and now it is time to start getting the big decisions right.\n\nPochettino will enter Stamford Bridge with the bar set low but there are materials to work with, providing he is allowed to do it his way, while his intense attacking style could fashion this into a quality team given time.\n\nFor now, however, Chelsea must complete the formalities of a desperate campaign that sees them currently in 12th place, and deservedly so.\n\u2022 None Go straight to the best Chelsea content\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

About 55 whales were stranded on Sunday morning\n\nAn entire pod of 55 pilot whales has died after a mass stranding on a Western Isles beach.\n\nOnly 15 were alive after they washed onto Traigh Mhor beach at North Tolsta on the Isle of Lewis at about 07:00 on Sunday morning.\n\nMarine charity British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) attempted to refloat one of the more active whales but it was then restranded.\n\nThe decision was taken to euthanise the remaining whales on welfare grounds.\n\nWestern Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - has asked people to avoid the area as a clean-up operation began.\n\nThe BDMLR released an update on Sunday evening which said that one of the dead whales appeared to have had a vaginal prolapse.\n\nThis led them to suspect that the whole pod stranded due to one female giving birth.\n\nPilot whales are known for their strong social bonds, so often when one whale gets into difficulty and strands, the rest follow.\n\nAttempts continued throughout the day to give the surviving whales first aid.\n\nBut after the attempt to refloat one of the whales, it was found further down the beach.\n\nA further three whales then died, leaving 12 still alive - eight adults and four calves.\n\nA statement said: \"At about 15:30, the local vet along with the Coastguard, Fire and Rescue, and a forensics vet came to the conclusion that the shallow beach and rough wave conditions made it too unsafe to refloat the remaining animals.\n\n\"Considering how long the pilot whales had been out of the water in addition to the poor conditions, it was decided that they should be euthanised on welfare grounds.\"\n\nMembers of the Lewis community, Stornoway Coastguard, Stornoway and Shawbost Fire and Rescue, the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), the Scottish SPCA, and Civil Air Support were all involved in the rescue effort, with vets and marine experts being flown in to help.\n\nSMASS will now carry out post mortem examinations of the bodies to conclude the cause of the stranding.\n\nPilot whales are small whales characterised as part of the dolphin family.\n\nPilot whales are social and therefore more likely to stick together when one gets into difficulty\n\nEarlier BDMLR's Welfare and Conservation Director Dan Jarvis told BBC Scotland that the longer the whales were on the beach, the less likely it was that they would survive.\n\nHe said: \"They have evolved to not have the ability to support their own weight on land. So when they are stranded they can crush themselves to death.\n\n\"Pilot whales don't usually come in to shore. They would be potentially disoriented, distressed from what has led to the stranding, and distressed from the stranding itself and being surrounded by family members who have died around them.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest incidents we've had in the last couple of decades.\"\n\nA Comhairle spokesperson said: \"Comhairle nan Eilean Siar asks that the public follow police advice and avoid Traigh Mh\u00f2r.\n\n\"The Comhairle has engaged with professionals and is now working with partner organisations to clear the beach.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTen people have been taken to hospital after a double-decker bus crashed into a bridge and had its roof torn off.\n\nThe crash happened in Cook Street in Glasgow, near the O2 venue, at 11.35 BST.\n\nThe injured people were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.\n\nA Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said: \"A number of additional casualties have been treated at the scene but do not require to be taken to hospital.\"\n\nThe crash happened in Cook Street on the south side of Glasgow\n\nThe roof viewed from behind the bus after the smash\n\nSeveral people were treated at the scene for minor injuries\n\nCh Insp Elaine Tomlinson, of Police Scotland's Greater Glasgow Division, said: \"Around 11.35am on Sunday, 21 May, 2023, we received a report of a bus crashing into a bridge on Cook Street, Glasgow.\n\n\"Emergency services attended and 10 people were taken to various hospitals for treatment.\n\n\"A number of road closures remain in place, with disruption to some rail services.\n\n\"I would like to thank the public for their co-operation and ask they continue to avoid the area while enquires are ongoing.\"\n\nFirst Bus confirmed it was one of its buses which was involved.\n\nA company spokesperson said: \"We are working closely with the emergency services at the scene and our thoughts are with those involved in the incident.\"\n\nNetwork Rail said its engineers would need to carry out an inspection of the bridge before it could be used by trains again.\n\nThe rail infrastructure agency said: \"We're assisting the emergency services, who are responding to a bus trapped beneath a bridge between Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street.\n\n\"We need to complete a safety inspection of the bridge before trains can use it again.

This was based on information incorrectly provided to the Nursing and Midwifery Council fitness to practise hearing. The article has been updated to reflect that the incident did not happen in the Spire Wrexham car park.", "The government has defended tests for Year 6 pupils across England, after some parents and teachers said a paper in this week's Sats was too difficult.\n\nOne head teacher said the English reading test included some \"GCSE-level\" questions. Some pupils were left in tears and did not finish the paper.\n\nIt has fuelled a debate among teachers and parents about the purpose of Sats.\n\nA Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson told BBC News the tests were \"designed to be challenging\".\n\nThe government had previously said it worked to ensure that \"all tests are appropriate\".\n\nBut asked for further comment on the English reading paper, the DfE added that Sats had to be tough \"in order to measure attainment across the ability range, including stretching the most able children\".\n\nThe government has advised that details of the content of the test paper should not be published until all Year 6 pupils have had the chance to take it.\n\nSats are tests taken by pupils in Year 2 and Year 6 to assess their reading, writing and maths skills - and to test schools' performances.\n\nSarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head teacher at Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham, said it was \"heartbreaking\" to see her pupils struggling to get through the reading paper.\n\nMrs Hewitt-Clarkson, who has two teenage daughters who have taken their GCSEs in the past few years, said: \"I'm not a secondary English teacher, but... some of those questions were definitely of that level. It's just unfair.\"\n\nMrs Hewitt-Clarkson hopes the Standards and Testing Agency - which is part of the DfE - might consider lowering the pass mark this year, in response to how difficult some students found it.\n\n\"For children to fail - or not achieve the standardised score - where we know in class they have been performing at an age-related expected level, or above, it just shows all the flaws of a system that depends almost entirely on one test,\" she said.\n\nThe government says it converts children's raw test scores into \"scaled scores\" so that tests can be compared, even if the difficulty varies.\n\nSarah Hewitt-Clarkson hopes this year's pass mark will be lowered\n\nHeather, from Ipswich, said her son found this week's Sats process \"absolutely fine\".\n\n\"Our school puts very little pressure on our children for the Sats,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's been quite a positive experience.\"\n\nBut Davina Bhanabhai, a writer from Leeds, said her daughter was \"really flustered\" by the English reading paper on Wednesday.\n\n\"Children came out feeling distraught, anxious and stressed. These three emotions are not what we want to bring our children up to experience,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"The teachers are stressed because that's the only measure they have that they can show that they're doing their job,\" she added. \"[The children] want to do well, so naturally that stress is going to be passed down [to them].\"\n\nTwo education unions, the National Education Union (NEU) and NAHT, have raised concerns about the paper.\n\nNEU joint general secretary, Mary Bousted, added there were \"better ways of assessing pupils\" than through Sats.\n\nSteve Chalke, founder of Oasis UK, a trust which runs schools across England, said the test had left \"many kids in tears, stressed and anxious\".\n\nHe said texts chosen in the reading test were \"inappropriate in that they were elitist\", and covered experiences that were \"completely outside the cultural context of children that live in poverty\".\n\n\"The texts were boring, they weren't fun, and education should be about fun as much as anything else,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.\n\nIsabel Nisbet, who was the chief executive of the exams watchdog Ofqual between 2007 and 2011, said a fair test is one \"learners can relate to, and the content is something that is meaningful to them\".\n\nShe said the tests will be marked consistently, and she is \"quite confident\" the way the marks are reported \"will take account of how difficult the test was\".\n\nShe told the Today programme: \"The problem is other types of unfairness\u2026 and in particular there is a kind of unfairness if people's legitimate expectations are not met.\n\n\"For example if they have practised particular types of text, or particular types of reading, and then the test comes along and suddenly they find it's not what they were brought to expect, and that's an upsetting thing.\"\n\nStandard Assessment Tests, or Sats, are tests that children take in Year 6, at the end of Key Stage 2. They are national curriculum assessments in English grammar, punctuation and spelling, English reading and maths.\n\nThe government's Standards and Testing Agency says the purposes of Sats tests are to:\n\nChildren also sit Sats in Year 2, at the end of Key Stage 1.\n\nLast year, 59% of Year 6 pupils met the expected levels in reading, writing and maths - down from 65% in 2019.\n\nThe national curriculum tests were cancelled in 2020 and 2021, during the pandemic.", "\"I never considered myself as someone who could work in tech,\" says teacher-turned-coder Jessica Gilbert.\n\nIt is sentiment that many women identify with - and something backed up by statistics.\n\nThere is a major skills gap in the tech sector and, as things stand, there will be only one qualified woman for every 115 tech roles by 2025.\n\nStudies show that women are less likely to work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) than men.\n\nHowever, some are beginning to buck the trend and kickstart a new career path.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, in 2021 there were 15,000 more women working as programmers and software developers in the UK than in the previous year. The number of women working as web designers increased by almost 10,000.\n\nBut even with these gains, women currently only make up 25% of coding jobs, according to SheCodes.\n\nJessica, from Glasgow, was a primary school teacher in Renfrewshire who had reached the point of burnout after being in the classroom for five years.\n\nShe says she was spending evenings and weekends preparing lessons, forking out her own money on resources for the children or asking family and friends to borrow things she could use in the class.\n\n\"I could never unwind from it,\" she says.\n\nThe 28-year old says she \"had no idea\" about jobs in tech until she saw an Instagram advert by Code First Girls offering a free eight week course on coding.\n\n\"I didn't have science or maths at school so I didn't think I could manage to code - I thought that those doors in STEM were closed,\" she said. \"To be honest I didn't even really know what a software engineer was.\n\n\"I assumed it was a geeky, guys job - I certainly didn't know any other women in these roles that I could look at as a role model or inspiration.\"\n\nAfter the initial course, Jessica went on to do further studies in coding in the evenings while still teaching, which she says was \"tough but worth it\".\n\nNow she works as a junior software engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming, and says she is much happier in the role despite not earning as much money as she was when teaching.\n\nJessica was part of a group on Facebook called \"Life after teaching\" and after sharing her story there she said her inbox was \"flooded with other teachers saying they are also looking to change careers\".\n\nShe then decided to set up an Instagram page called @teacher2coder to tell other women about what a tech job involves.\n\n\"I previously discounted coding as something for computer scientists or geniuses. But if you are good at communicating and problem solving - a job in tech can be for you.\"\n\nThaslima Ferdous, 25, studied biomedical science at university and had the intention of becoming a doctor one day, so was working as a healthcare assistant in the NHS in London.\n\nThaslima Ferdous left the NHS to become a data engineer\n\n\"The NHS was really struggling and I felt unappreciated,\" she says.\n\nAfter reading a story about a young woman who had become a coder, she began to wonder if she could switch careers but was sceptical about working in tech when she had a pure science background.\n\n\"I began to think 'what do I have to lose?' So decided to do a 14 week coding bootcamp which taught me the foundations of python and SQL.\"\n\n\"My team is entirely male but this is the start,\" she adds.\n\n\"I don't think career changing is as daunting as it used to be. If you're willing to work hard and put in the hours, there's no reason why a tech job isn't for you.\"\n\nONS labour force survey data from June 2022 showed that while there were 512,900 men working as programmers, software development professionals, web design professionals and data analysts, there were only 113,900 women doing these jobs - just 18.17%.\n\nFemale-founded Code First Girls provides free coding courses to women, helping companies recruit by connecting them with newly trained female developers.\n\nAnna Brailsford, chief executive of the social enterprise, says women need to be given the chance to change their minds about the stereotypes surrounding careers in STEM.\n\n\"There is a whole pool of untapped talent amongst those who started out in different fields of study and in different careers,\" she says.\n\n\"These are candidates who may have never considered a STEM career before, convinced it was a career just for men, or that they didn't have the right skills. But they come with a wealth of experience to change things in technology for the better.\"", "The world will likely use fewer fossil fuels to produce electricity this year in a \"turning point\" for planet-friendly energy, a new report says.\n\nIt would be the first ever annual drop in the use of coal, oil and gas to generate electricity, outside of a global recession or pandemic.\n\nAs a result, fewer warming gases would be released during energy production.\n\nThe authors attribute the expected change to a boom in renewable energy led mainly by China.\n\nWind and solar now produce 12% of global electricity with enough wind turbines added in 2022 to power almost all of the UK.\n\nRenewables are set to meet all growth in demand this year, the study from energy analysts Ember says.\n\nMaking electricity is the single biggest contributor to global warming, responsible for over a third of energy-related carbon emissions in 2021.\n\nSo phasing out coal, oil and gas in this sector is seen as critical in helping the world avoid dangerous levels of climate change.\n\nThis new study looks at data from countries representing 93% of global electricity demand.\n\nEnough wind energy was added globally to almost power the UK\n\nThis, the fourth edition of Ember's Global Electricity Review, indicates that significant progress is now being made in reducing the role of fossil fuels in power production.\n\nThe major developments are the continuing rise of solar and wind as economically viable sources of electricity. Around the world, solar grew by 24% last year, enough to meet the annual demands of a country as big as South Africa.\n\nTaken together with nuclear and hydropower, clean sources produced 39% of global electricity in 2022. The report finds that electricity produced last year was, in effect, the cleanest ever made.\n\nBut despite this, carbon emissions from the sector also continued to rise, as coal use edged up.\n\nChina added around 40% of the world's new solar panels last year, with large numbers of rooftop installations\n\nAccording to the report's authors this is because overall demand for electricity rose, and not all of it was met from clean sources.\n\nThere were also problems with nuclear and hydro electricity in 2022, with many French reactors offline, and Europe's rivers too low in many places for hydro generation.\n\nHowever the report says that in 2023, the growth of wind and solar will be greater than the rise in demand - and this will start to turn the tide on warming gases.\n\n\"When you stop adding more fossil fuels to generate your electricity, you start seeing a fall in emissions,\" said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, the report's lead author.\n\n\"This is extremely important in the context of rising electrification, as we have more electric vehicles, more heat pumps, so cleaning the power sector will drive emissions down in other sectors as well.\"\n\nWhile the fall in fossil fuel emissions in electricity this year is expected to be small, around 0.3%, the authors believe the drop will continue and accelerate in subsequent years. Key to this is a fall off in the use of gas, which fell slightly last year according to the report, with some countries like Brazil seeing a surge in hydro power which reduced their use of gas by 46% in 2022.\n\nMeeting the rising demand for electricity with renewables is key to curbing fossil fuel use\n\n\"We now have reached this next turning point of starting to see a new era of falling fossil fuel power sector emissions. We know that wind and solar are the answer and we've just got to get on with a roadmap for building them as quickly as possible,\" said Dave Jones, from Ember, one of the report's authors.\n\nOne significant player impacting the overall trend is China. Around 50% of the global addition of wind power came from China and about 40% of the world's new solar came from from the country that's also the world's biggest use of coal power.\n\n\"There is a chance that at the rate that China is building wind and solar and all types of clean generation, that they achieve that peak in coal generation earlier than 2025, which would be significant,\" said Mr Jones.\n\nEnergy experts acknowledge that curbing fossil fuels in power generation could well be a \"turning point\", but much more remains to be done.\n\n\"The earliest peak of coal power generation was in the UK in 1979,\" said Prof Jessica Jewell from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it took decades to fully phase out coal power, for example the UK still used a bit of coal in 2022, 43 years past the peak. In order to reach clean energy goals we don't have 40 or even 30 years, we need to fully decarbonize electricity in a much shorter time.\"", "The settlement is separate from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which started in September 2017\n\nHundreds of bereaved family members, survivors and residents have agreed a settlement of civil claims arising from the Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nThe devastating fire at the west London building killed 72 people in June 2017.\n\nCladding giant Arconic confirmed it was among the companies involved in the High Court case and had agreed to a settlement with more than 900 people.\n\nIt has also \"agreed to contribute to a restorative justice project to benefit the community affected by the fire\".\n\nThe settlement is separate from the long-running inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, which is examining the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the blaze.

It applies to both alcoholic and soft drinks.\n\nSome businesses have said previously that the scheme will place extra costs and other burdens on them at a time when they are already struggling.\n\nAll three SNP leadership contenders now say the initiative will not go ahead in its present form - Kate Forbes and Ash Regan want it paused, while Humza Yousaf would exempt smaller firms for a year.\n\nLorna Slater, the Scottish Greens minister leading the scheme, says she is \"actively considering\" such a grace period for small businesses.\n\nAt her party's conference on Saturday, she repeated her commitment to the scheme, saying it would \"dramatically increase recycling, reduce littering and cut emissions\".\n\nShe added that it was a tried-and-tested policy based on successful schemes around the world, where the polluter pays instead of the picking up a bill for rubbish.\n\nThe scheme is due to go live on 16 August.\n\nSoft drinks served in tin cans would be part of the deposit return scheme, which will launch on 16 August\n\nGavin Partington, director general of the BSDA, said DRS had to be a top priority for the new first minister.\n\nHe added that he wants the next leader to commit to the current timeframe and focus on a smooth delivery.\n\nRoger White, the chief executive of AG Barr - the maker of Irn Bru and also a member of the BSDA - warned against delaying the introduction of the scheme.\n\nHe added: \"Scotland's DRS delivers for the environment, society and industry and to delay it now would be to the detriment of all those things.\"\n\nDrinks producers and importers are responsible for delivering the scheme but a private non-profit company called Circularity Scotland has been created to administer it on their behalf.\n\nRetailers also have a key role to play by operating the container return points.\n\nStephen Moorhouse, VP and general manager at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners GB, said the company and other \"responsible producers\" had spent the past three years preparing for the launch of DRS.\n\nHe said: \"We remain committed to the current timescale, but the Scottish government's clear and full support for DRS is critical if the scheme is to launch successfully in August.\"\n\nThe aim of the DRS is to incentivise recycling, to reduce litter and help tackle climate change by reducing the amount of material going to landfill.\n\nDr Kat Jones, director of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) said it was \"extremely encouraging\" to see so many producers committed to working in a more sustainable way.\n\nShe said delaying the scheme again would be \"irresponsible and counterproductive\" and would leave those businesses which had prepared for it out of pocket.\n\nShe added: \"As things stand, more than 900 million cans and bottles are wasted in Scotland every year, ending up in landfill, incineration, or littered in our towns and our countryside.\n\n\"This is expensive as well as environmentally damaging. And it is also not good for the reputation of drinks producers, whose customers want them to take part in deposit return, just as those same companies already do across so many other European countries.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said that ministers remain committed to the August start date for the DRS.\n\nThey said: \"It will make producers responsible for recycling the bottles and cans they put on the market. Similar schemes are common in other European countries and have been shown to be very effective at reducing litter and increasing recycling rates.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. We've got to double down and stick to our plan - Sunak\n\nRishi Sunak has insisted the Conservatives can still win the next general election, despite suffering two damaging by-election defeats.\n\nLabour and the Lib Dems overturned big Tory majorities in Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty constituencies.\n\nBut the Tories held the London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, despite predictions they could lose there too.\n\nThe result showed the next election was not a \"done deal\" for Labour, the prime minister said.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party's \"incredible\" win in Selby and Ainsty was a \"cry for change\" from voters.\n\nHe added the result, where his party overturned a Tory majority of more than 20,000, was a \"big step forward\" ahead of the next general election, expected to take place next year.\n\nThe Tories' narrow victory in the suburban seat of Uxbridge, which they won by 495 votes, spared Mr Sunak the humiliation of being the first PM for 55 years to lose three by-elections in one night.\n\nThe party managed to capitalise on local anger over the planned expansion of the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a tax on polluting vehicles, to outer London boroughs by the capital's Labour mayor.\n\nVisiting a cafe in the constituency, Mr Sunak said it showed that people would vote Conservative when confronted with the \"reality\" of Labour in power.\n\nBut the other two results suggest the Tories face a difficult path to possible victory at the next election, with the party trailing Labour in the polls nationally by significant margins.\n\nAsked what the defeats meant for his party, Mr Sunak replied: \"The message I take away is that we've got to double down, stick to our plan and deliver for people.\"\n\nHe vowed to renew his focus on his government's five flagship priorities of halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing debt and NHS waiting times, and stopping small boat crossings.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Tory MPs to \"row in behind the prime minister,\" adding that \"divided parties don't win elections\".\n\nHowever, a former cabinet minister on the right of the Conservative Party told the BBC the \"eye-watering swings\" in Selby and Somerton showed the party needs a \"complete change of direction\".\n\n\"Uxbridge provides no get-out-of-jail-free card for Rishi,\" they added.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear that a failure by the party leadership to act now and change course risks electoral Armageddon.\"\n\nProgress towards the prime minister's pledges has so far been slow, with inflation in particular falling more slowly than predicted by many economists at the start of the year.\n\nConservative chairman Greg Hands conceded there was a \"lot of work still to be done\" to meet the promises, adding they \"weren't designed to be an easy thing to meet\".\n\nTory peer Lord Frost, a former minister, said his party needed to give people \"something to vote for,\" arguing the results were mainly down to its voters staying at home.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, he renewed his calls for the party to promise tax cuts, reduce levels of legal immigration, and delay net zero targets, adding it was currently offering voters policies too similar to Labour's.\n\nLabour won with a 23.7% swing in the rural North Yorkshire seat of Selby and Ainsty, breaking the record for the largest Tory majority it had overturned at a by-election since 1945.\n\nAnd a 29% swing to the Liberal Democrats in the Somerset seat of Somerton and Frome showed they could be a stronger challenger to the Tories in the West Country than at the last election in 2019.\n\nPolling expert Sir John Curtice said the Conservatives' vote share across the three by-elections showed the party was in \"as deep an electoral hole as the opinion polls have been suggesting\".\n\nHe added that its two defeats in Somerset and Yorkshire had both seen tactical voting to eject the Conservatives locally, spelling \"bad news\" for the governing party.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party's victory was \"nothing short of spectacular\", and showed his party were \"back in the West Country\".\n\nHe added that there were 15 south-western seats with smaller Tory majorities, making his party \"best placed\" to defeat the Conservatives in the region.", "Russia's president has said members of the Wagner mercenary group were fully funded by the state.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Putin, Wagner was given 86.262bn roubles ($1bn) from May 2022 to May 2023 alone for salaries and bonuses, which came from the defence ministry and state budget.\n\nIts leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday after agreeing to leave Russia.\n\nHis arrival was confirmed by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Earlier, a private jet linked to Prigozhin was tracked landing in Minsk, the Belarusian capital.\n\nOn Saturday, mercenary troops led by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin took over the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, marched on Moscow and shot down Russian military helicopters and a plane on their way.\n\nTheir mutiny was later aborted after a deal was struck with the help of Mr Lukashenko.\n\nThe Russian authorities said Wagner will be disarmed but its members will escape prosecution over its short-lived rebellion.\n\n\"We always treated fighters and commanders from this group with great respect, because they really showed bravery and heroism,\" said Mr Putin.\n\nHe said authorities would look into how the money paid to Wagner and its leader was spent.\n\nPreparations are under way for the group to hand over its heavy weapons and equipment to the Russian army, the defence ministry said.\n\nCriminal charges have also been dropped against those who took part in the mutiny, according to the FSB security service.\n\nWagner members were facing prosecution for armed insurrection, but the case has been closed because the mutineers had stopped short of actually committing a crime, the FSB said.\n\nIts fighters can either join the regular army, go home or head for Belarus, Mr Putin said on Monday, adding that the fighters were mostly \"patriots\" who had been misled into a criminal adventure.\n\nMr Lukashenko said Belarus has not started building any camps for members of the group, but will accommodate them if they want.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr Putin told Russian troops in Moscow their actions during the mutiny had prevented a \"civil war\" and held a minute's silence for those killed.\n\nHe insisted that the Wagner forces never had the support of the army or the people, although crowds cheered and applauded Wagner troops as they left Rostov-on-Don.\n\nThe treatment of the mercenaries stands in marked contrast to the treatment of opposition politicians and activists, many of whom are in prison simply for speaking out against the war in Ukraine.\n\nOpposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, for example, is serving 25 years for treason.\n\nBy contrast, Wagner chief Prigozhin and the armed men who took part in the rebellion are seemingly being allowed to go free.\n\nPrigozhin has defended his actions, insisting the revolt was not meant to be a challenge to the leadership of Mr Putin.\n\nRather, he described it as a bid to save his mercenary group from being absorbed into the Russian army, and to expose the failures of the country's military leadership.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The day Wagner chief went rogue... in 96 seconds", "Prince Harry has criticised attempts by Associated Newspapers to have the High Court case thrown out\n\nPrince Harry says he is determined to hold the publisher of the Mail newspapers to account as he says he is \"deeply concerned\" by their \"unchecked power, influence and criminality\".\n\nHis witness statement was disclosed as part of his privacy case against Associated Newspapers.\n\nIn it, he also claimed he was kept out of Royal Family discussions about taking legal action on phone hacking.\n\nHe attended the High Court for a second day of legal arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex and six other claimants, including Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence - the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence - claim their personal information was obtained illegally and used as material for Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday stories.\n\nAssociated Newspapers has dismissed the claims as \"preposterous smears\" based on a \"fishing expedition\".\n\nIn the duke's statement, he criticises attempts by the publisher in court this week to have the case thrown out for legal reasons.\n\n\"Unfair is not a big enough word to describe the fact that Associated is trying at this early stage to prevent me from bringing my claim,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"If the most influential and popular newspaper in the UK can evade justice without there being a trial of my claims, then what does that say about the industry as a whole and the consequences for our great country.\n\n\"I am bringing this claim because I love my country and I remain deeply concerned by the unchecked power, influence and criminality of Associated.\"\n\nThe statement details stories the duke claims were based on private information which had been obtained illegally.\n\nThey include reports about his relationships with two girlfriends.\n\nHe also criticises a story about his reaction, along with that of his brother William, to the publication of pictures of his dying mother in the Italian media.\n\n\"It is really disgusting\", he says, with a \"crude headline\" and \"explicit reference to a phone call\".\n\n\"My brother and I were relatively young at the time (I was just 21) and we were having private conversations about photographs of our dead mother which had been put into the public domain.\"\n\nIn his witness statement, Prince Harry said the Royal Family - which he referred to as the Institution - had been withholding information from him about the possibility of taking legal action in response to media intrusions.\n\nHe said he only started talking to a senior lawyer for the Royal Family when he began dating his now wife and \"defamatory stories\" were published.\n\nThe prince eventually became aware he could take legal action over phone hacking in 2018, he says.\n\n\"The Institution made it clear that we did not need to know anything about phone hacking and it was made clear to me that the Royal Family did not sit in the witness box because that could open up a can of worms,\" he said.\n\nSir Elton John and his husband David Furnish have made claims in the High Court case\n\nFellow claimant Sir Elton John has meanwhile accused a private investigator of tapping his home phone and that of his gardener.\n\nHe said it was a \"violation of our home and the safety of our children and loved ones.\"\n\nSir Elton is claiming damages in relation to 10 articles for which he says the Mail titles \"misused information which they stole from our family and friends\".\n\nIn his witness statement, he said the Mail exploited \"love, connection, trust and bonds to find out information shared in confidence\".\n\nSir Elton's case against Associated Newspapers includes the claim that a private investigator obtained details of his medical conditions, including that he had \"collapsed on a plane\".\n\nHis husband, David Furnish, is also making claims in the High Court legal action.\n\nHis statement reveals the couple were informed by the actor Liz Hurley of the allegation that their live phone calls had been intercepted by an investigator working for the Mail on Sunday.\n\nShe said the investigator appeared to know that Sir Elton did not have his own mobile phone and used several landlines.\n\nMs Hurley alleged that her calls had also been tapped.\n\nBaroness Lawrence claims private investigators working for the Daily Mail tapped her home phone and hacked her voicemails.\n\nIn her own statement to the High Court, she also accused the newspaper of commissioning investigators to monitor her bank accounts and phone bills.\n\nShe says she trusted the Daily Mail, which had strongly campaigned for justice for her family, but concluded: \"I was played for a fool.\"\n\nAssociated Newspapers rejected her allegations as \"appalling and utterly groundless smears\".\n\nThe publisher said the claims were based on the word of private investigator Jonathan Rees, who has served a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice.\n\nIn a statement last year, Associated said: \"It is deeply saddening that whoever is cynically and unscrupulously orchestrating these claims appears to have persuaded Baroness Lawrence - for whom the Mail has the greatest respect and admiration - to endorse the word of someone who is such a manifestly discredited and untrustworthy liar.\"\n\nBut Baroness Lawrence said in her witness statement, disclosed by the court, that she feared the actions of private investigators may have disrupted investigations into Stephen's murder.\n\nIn her statement, she said: \"We developed good relationships with the press and by February 1997 we aligned ourselves with the Daily Mail and who always held themselves out to be the guardians of truth and justice, the people who fight corruption and who hold the bad people accountable and who really cared about the fact my son's killers had walked free.\"\n\nBut upon discovering the alleged use of private investigators, she said there had been a \"level of trust\" and \"the betrayal I felt when that was taken away and I realised it had all been false was intense\".\n\nShe added: \"I cannot think of any act or conduct lower than stealing and exploiting information from a murder and from a mother who buried her son, and by people who pretended to be my friends.\n\n\"It has been a new trauma and injustice for me.\"\n\nAllegations in the case against Associated Newspapers include phone tapping, \"hacking\" of voicemail messages and the use of private investigators to obtain personal data.\n\nMore than 70 journalists have been implicated by the allegations made by seven claimants - Prince Harry, Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish, Sadie Frost, Liz Hurley, Baroness Doreen Lawrence and Sir Simon Hughes.\n\nTheir names cannot be reported for legal reasons.\n\nLegal arguments on Tuesday centred on ledgers setting out payments made by Associated Newspapers (ANL) to 19 private investigators in the past, alleged to have been working for the journalists.\n\nThe seven claimants say these were for large sums of money and are proof that illegal methods were being used to gather information about them.\n\nThe ledgers were disclosed to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2011.\n\nANL is trying to get part of the case struck out because, it says, the Leveson files cannot be used in other cases, due to confidentiality rules.\n\nThe company also says that two barristers in this case, and Sir Simon Hughes, were closely involved in the Leveson Inquiry and gave \"undertakings\" not to disclose documents they received.\n\nBarristers for ANL told the court these restrictions would have to be removed by the government if the evidence was to be used in the current case. This has not happened and they said sections of the case relying on the ledgers should therefore be struck out.\n\nBut David Sherborne, representing the seven who are suing Associated, told the judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, that the ledgers had in fact been obtained by an investigative journalist, not from the Leveson Inquiry.\n\nAs a leading barrister at the Leveson Inquiry, representing victims of press intrusion, he had personally agreed not to disclose confidential information.\n\nBut he said that undertaking ended when the inquiry report was published in 2012.\n\nThe court also released the witness statement of private investigator Gavin Burrows, who denied all allegations that he hacked phones, tapped landlines, or bugged cars on behalf of the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday.\n\nAddressing the specific allegations made by Prince Harry, Baroness Lawrence, Elton John, David Furnish, Sadie Frost and Liz Hurley, he said: \"I was not instructed or commissioned by the Mail on Sunday or the Daily Mail to conduct unlawful information gathering.\"\n\nTwo other private investigators have also made statements to the court admitting their role in supplying illegally-obtained information to journalists at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.", "A ban on fees to get rid of DIY waste in England will push up costs for all households, councils have warned.\n\nCurrently around a third of local authorities charge to dispose of DIY waste at recycling centres.\n\nThe government said the ban, which is expected to come into force later this year, aims to deter fly-tipping.\n\nBut the Local Government Association (LGA) said the costs would still be passed on, for example through higher council tax.\n\nThe organisation, which represents councils in England, said the change would cost many councils more than \u00a31m a year.\n\nSuffolk County Council said scrapping the charges would cost an estimated \u00a3500,000 a year, while Norfolk County Council said the cost would be more than \u00a31m a year.\n\nCharges to dispose of materials like paving slabs, plasterboard and bricks can be up to \u00a310 an item.\n\nThe LGA's environment spokesman, Darren Rodwell, said: \"Where councils are no longer able to charge for DIY waste at recycling centres the cost will be passed to all householders, including households that do not have a car and those with no possibility of carrying out building works, for example people living in rented accommodation.\"\n\nHe added: \"Manufacturers should also contribute to the costs to councils of clear up, by providing more take-back services so people can hand in sofas, old furniture and mattresses when they buy new ones.\"\n\nThe government said the change was part of its wider action to tackle fly-tipping, which costs the economy an estimated \u00a3924m a year in England.\n\nHowever, Mr Rodwell said evidence from councils and recycling campaign group Wrap did not show a link between charges and fly-tipping.\n\nEnvironment Minister Rebecca Pow said: \"We want to make it as easy as possible for people to dispose of their waste properly and that's why we are removing the financial burden on doing the right thing with DIY trash.\"\n\nJacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association, which represents the waste management industry, said: \"We welcome any measures that make it easier for householders to dispose of waste correctly and responsibly at their local Household Waste Recycling Centre, which in turn reduces the chance of it falling into the hands of criminals or being fly-tipped.\"\n\nIn 2015, the government banned charges on local residents disposing of household rubbish at household waste centres.\n\nGuidance made clear this includes DIY household waste. But some local authorities were still able to charge for certain types of DIY material, under rules designed for construction waste.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The report suggests people avoid some stories like the war in Ukraine as they switch off depressing news\n\nThe number of people taking a strong interest in the news has dropped by around a quarter in the last six years, a global study suggests.\n\nA report by Oxford University's Reuters Institute says 48% of people around the world are very or extremely interested in the news - down from 63% in 2017.\n\nIn the UK, the proportion is lower than the global average at 43%.\n\nMore than a third of people (36%) worldwide say they sometimes or often actively avoid the news.\n\nThe authors of the institute's report said there was evidence that audiences \"continue to selectively avoid important stories such as the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis as they cut back on depressing news and look to protect their mental health\".\n\nThe Digital News Report 2023 also concluded that traditional TV and print news media are continuing to decline, while \"online consumers are accessing news less frequently than in the past and are also becoming less interested\".\n\nFour in 10 people (40%) say they trust most news most of the time, down two percentage points compared with last year.\n\nIn the UK, the BBC was the most trusted news brand, followed by Channel 4 and ITV.\n\nThe research also reported that more than half (56%) of those surveyed worry about identifying what news is real and fake online - up two percentage points.\n\nThe most important social media platform for news is still Facebook, although it is in long-term decline, with the number accessing it each week for news dropping from 42% to 28% over the past seven years.\n\nFacebook has also downgraded news. It says less than 3% of its news feed these days is traditional news stories. The tweaking of the algorithm over recent years has been catastrophic for some organisations that relied on its traffic.\n\nIn the UK, 41% of 18 to 24-year-olds say social media is their main source of news (43% across all countries), up from 18% in 2015.\n\nTikTok and Instagram have both seen increases in use. Instagram is now a source of news for 14% of people, with TikTok on 6%.\n\nTikTok is the survey's fastest growing social network, used by a fifth of 18-24-year-olds for news\n\nBut the figures are much higher for young users. One in five (20%) 18 to 24-year-olds get news from TikTok, up from 15% last year. The report says the platform \"is the fastest growing social network in our survey\".\n\nHowever, it is not necessarily news from traditional news providers. TikTok users are more likely to get news on the platform from celebrities, influencers or ordinary creators than mainstream news outlets or journalists.\n\nReuters Institute director Rasmus Neilsen said: \"Younger generations increasingly eschew direct discovery for all but the most appealing brands.\n\n\"They have little interest in many conventional news offers oriented towards older generations' habits, interests, and values, and instead embrace the more personality-based, participatory, and personalised options offered by social media, often looking beyond legacy platforms to new entrants.\"\n\nThe report says younger and hard to reach audiences in particular are taking part in high \"news avoidance\"\n\nLiking, sharing and commenting about news on open social media platforms is also in decline.\n\nOnly around 10% of people in the UK are classed as \"active participants\" - they are largely male, old, have strong political views and are more highly educated than the rest of the population.\n\nOne reason suggested for the change is a growing sense that online conversations on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have become increasingly toxic.\n\nHowever, while the sharing of articles and engagement time may have dropped, it doesn't mean such sites are being deserted.\n\nTwitter made headlines after it was bought by Elon Musk, but the number of people using the site each week appears to have has barely changed. There is, Reuters said, no evidence of a mass movement to rivals such as Mastodon.", "Critics have branded the UK government's delayed \u00a31bn package of support for the semiconductor industry as \"insignificant\".\n\nSemiconductors, or chips, are inside everything from phones to cars and the government has just unveiled a new 10-year strategy.\n\nBut it is facing allegations it is not enough - the US and EU have announced support closer to $50bn (\u00a340bn).\n\nThe PM said the plan would help turn the UK into a technology superpower.\n\nDetails were released shortly after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak agreed a partnership on semiconductors with Japan.\n\nBy boosting Britain's semiconductor industry \"we will grow our economy, create new jobs and stay at the forefront of new technological breakthroughs\", Mr Sunak said.\n\nHowever, that ambition took a knock when Cambridge-based firm Arm, whose chip designs power many smartphones, chose to list its shares in New York rather than London.\n\nArm, arguably once Britain's biggest tech asset, was sold to Japanese firm Softbank despite calls for government intervention.\n\nThe UK's biggest chip plant in Newport was also very nearly taken over by a Chinese company.\n\nBut Rene Haas, Arm's current chief executive, did welcome the new regime which would help the UK play a part in global chip supply chains for the next generation of technology.\n\nAnd trade body TechUK said it was a \"starting gun\" on a bright future for the UK semiconductor industry.\n\nTim Pullen, from British chip maker IQE, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the government strategy is \"definitely stepping\" the industry in the \"right direction.\"\"It recognises the importance of semiconductors to the economy, to national security, and to supply chain security that's so vital to our lives and what we now need to do is work very closely with the government as we move to the execution phase,\" he said.\n\nBut critics argue the sums on offer in the strategy, which had been expected to appear last autumn, are limited compared to other nations' efforts.\n\nUS support to its industry under the CHIPS Act totals $52bn, while the EU equivalent will amount to \u20ac43bn of aid.\n\nThe money is also small compared with private sector investment. This week Ireland saw semiconductor firm ADI invest \u20ac630m in a research and manufacturing facility in Limerick.\n\nThe chair of the House of Commons Business Select Committee, Labour MP Darren Jones, welcomed the strategy and the recognition of the need to invest but added, \"the initial \u00a3250m is a very small amount of subsidy compared to other countries\".\n\nUnder the strategy \u00a3200m will be invested between 2023-25 to provide infrastructure for industry, fund more research, and promote international co-operation.\n\nLabour shadow culture minister Lucy Powell said that after years of delays, the strategy would be met with disappointment and showed \"significantly less ambition than our competitors\".\n\nGaurav Gupta of consultants Gartner said the funding was fine for research, but if the ambition was to be competitive with the big players in the field - Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom and AMD then the \u00a31bn was \"insignificant\".\n\nDr Simon Thomas, chief executive of UK based graphene semiconductor start-up Paragraf, told the BBC the announcement was \"quite frankly flaccid\".\n\n\"It is a long way from addressing the needs of UK chipmakers,\" he said.\n\nZoe Kleinman, the BBC's technology editor said: \"Many businesses making hardware say when there's a shortage, it's difficult to get a look-in with the enormous chip manufacturers because their output is hoovered up by giants like Apple with far deeper pockets than anybody else.\n\n\"Will the UK government have sharp enough elbows to muscle in? It is a noble ambition to attempt to \"mitigate\" supply chain issues but ultimately, if we aren't making chips at scale ourselves, we are always going to be at the mercy of someone else.\"\n\nThe BBC, and other media, were not shown the full report ahead of publication, but a summary was provided by officials.\n\nThe strategy will focus on areas the UK is particularly good at: semiconductor design, cutting-edge \"compound\" semiconductors, and research - areas that also require less funding than large scale chip manufacturing where essential machines cost hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nThe strategy will also try to increase the security of chip supply through international partnerships.\n\nRecent pandemic-fuelled chip shortages disrupted supplies of products from games to cars and critical manufacturing is concentrated in a few countries, such as Taiwan.\n\nPeter Claydon, the president of Picocom a chip design company based in Bristol, told the BBC it was good to have the strategy but said: \"It's not a lot of money.\"\n\nAnd he would have liked to have seen tax breaks used to support the industry and more emphasis on education to help supply the skilled professionals the industry needs.\n\nHowever, he valued the strategy's emphasis on international cooperation, although he said it would have been better to have remained in the EU with its multi-billion euro programme, which was enough to \"make some difference\", he said.", "A wildfire raging earlier this month in British Columbia - where another firefighter lost her life in recent days\n\nA second firefighter has been killed in Canada as the country battles its worst season of wildfires on record.\n\nThe person, who has not yet been named, died from injuries sustained while fighting a fire near Fort Liard in the Northwest Territories on Saturday.\n\nIt comes just days after 19-year-old Devyn Gale was killed while working in neighbouring British Columbia.\n\nNearly 900 wildfires are currently burning across Canada, about 580 of which remain out of control.\n\nSo far this season, the fires have burned more than 10m hectares (24.7m acres) of land, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.\n\nThe figure is higher than for any previous year on record and more than three times the average for the previous 10 years.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"incredibly saddened\" by the news that a second firefighter had lost their life, and sent his condolences to their family.\n\nCaroline Cochrane, premier of the Northwest Territories, said the death was a \"tragic loss for the entire territory\".\n\n\"I extend my heartfelt condolences to their family, friends and colleagues,\" she said.\n\n\"The bravery and selflessness of our firefighters is an incredible gift to us all. Thank you for your service to our territory and to our country.\"\n\nMs Gale's death was the first death on the ground since the start of Canada's wildfire season - and reportedly the first in British Columbia since 2015.\n\nAfterwards, Mr Trudeau said Canadians \"must never forget the risks these heroes take every time they run toward the danger\".\n\n\"To firefighters... across the country who are doing just that to keep us safe: Thank you. We are inspired by your courage, and grateful for your service,\" he said.\n\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nCanada is estimated to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and in recent years has seen extreme weather events of increasing frequency and intensity.\n\nThe wildfires have also sparked pollution alerts across North America as smoke is blown south along the continent's eastern coast.\n\nNineteen-year-old Devyn Gale was killed while fighting a fire in British Columbia", "The cross-party All Under One Banner movement holds regular independence marches\n\nThe route to independence used to seem simple for SNP members.\n\nThere was a widespread expectation in the party that election victories would lead to a second referendum.\n\nBut the continued UK government refusal to grant another vote, and last year's Supreme Court confirmation that Holyrood doesn't have the powers to legislate for one, has left the party looking for a new direction.\n\nAnd that's why members will descend on Dundee this weekend.\n\nAt the party's Convention on Independence, they hope to flesh out a new strategy.\n\nSo what are the alternative paths to independence?\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list, but here are three options the SNP may consider this weekend.\n\nOption one could be called the gradualist approach.\n\nThis involves taking time to drive up support for independence, ultimately reaching a level that means Downing Street can't ignore referendum demands.\n\nIt's rare for anyone in the SNP to publicly put a number on the level of support needed for this, but a sustained period of 60% pro-independence polling is thrown around privately.\n\nThe MSP Ben Macpherson is a former Scottish government minister. He stresses that he's as dedicated to independence as anyone in the SNP, but he believes that patience is required.\n\nHe's urged fellow members to focus on convincing more undecided voters to support independence, which he believes will create \"overwhelming\" pressure on the UK government to grant a second referendum.\n\nBut others feel another referendum won't happen, and that brings us to option two. This involves using elections to secure independence.\n\nIt's a tactic that's gained prominence in SNP circles in recent years.\n\nTowards the end of her leadership, Nicola Sturgeon floated the idea of running an election as a \"de facto\" referendum.\n\nThe concept is fairly simple: the SNP would contest an election (or elections) insisting that a vote for them is a vote for independence. This could be stated in the opening line of a manifesto.\n\nAsh Regan, who ran to replace Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year, backs this approach.\n\nShe believes the SNP could even team up with other pro-independence parties, meaning that more than 50% of the vote combined would lead to independence.\n\nShe thinks it's time to move away from relying on the referendum path, saying \"we've been thinking of it as the gold standard, but in fact it's the ballot box that's the gold standard route\".\n\nBut there are potential weaknesses with this option.\n\nWhy would the UK government agree to this? Would the international community recognise it?\n\nMost advocates of such a Plan B feel that Westminster intransigence on a second referendum means that a radical alternative is needed.\n\nBut others fear it won't deliver independence and would alienate the middle-ground of Scottish politics.\n\nOption three involves taking to the streets - mass demonstrations calling for independence.\n\nPerhaps this option should be seen as complementing others, rather than being a route to independence in itself.\n\nThe cross-party All Under One Banner movement will march from Stirling to Bannockburn at the very same time the SNP gathers in Dundee.\n\nPatrick McCarthy is organising Saturday's All Under One Banner march\n\nAs a party member, Patrick McCarthy could have attended the convention. But he worries the SNP is simply \"talking to themselves\" .\n\nHe'll be \"speaking to the mass movement\" by organising the march instead.\n\nHe says \"the hearts and minds and belief in independence is the thing that's going to get us over the line\".\n\nThe first minister will set out his preferred route to independence at Saturday's convention.\n\nThe first minister must show SNP members that he has an indy plan\n\nHumza Yousaf wants to drive up overall support, but he's also said that elections must be used to advance the cause of independence.\n\nThis convention won't rubber-stamp any strategy. That would have to come at the SNP's autumn conference.\n\nThere are political risks for Humza Yousaf in this weekend's convention.\n\nIt could highlight splits within his party. And it exposes him to accusations that he's prioritising the constitution over day-to-day problems.\n\nBut, given that independence is his party's fundamental aim, it's important for him to show party members that he's formulating a plan to achieve the ultimate goal.\n\nThe SNP may emerge closer to defining their strategy on independence, but making that a reality feels a harder task for the party right now.", "The Northern says birth numbers in the Causeway Coast and Glens area have declined year-on-year\n\nBirths will no longer take place at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, County Londonderry, following a decision by the Department of Health (DoH).\n\nThe DoH permanent secretary approved the move to consolidate maternity services at Antrim Area Hospital.\n\nThe Northern Trust had recommended that all births in the area should permanently move to the Antrim site.\n\nAntenatal and postnatal clinics will be retained and enhanced at Causeway Hospital, the department said.\n\nPermanent Secretary Peter May said the decision was made to ensure safe, consistent and sustainable care for mothers and babies in the trust area.\n\nThe recommendation was made by the Northern Trust board following a 14-week public consultation.\n\nThe changes will come into effect from 17 July 2023.\n\nAny women who are due to give birth at Causeway Hospital will be contacted directly by the trust and there is also a helpline to answer any queries from women who are due to give birth at the hospital.\n\nA trust spokeswoman said the decision for all hospital births to go to Antrim Area Hospital was a welcome one.\n\n\"We strongly believe this is the best outcome for women and babies in our care,\" she said.\n\n\"It will allow us to continue providing the highest standard of inpatient maternity care and births at one, dedicated site, with a safer, more sustainable staffing model.\"\n\nThe trust said it recognised it had been an uncertain time for the \"dedicated team of maternity staff at Causeway Hospital and we will be supporting them through this period of transition.\"\n\nThe trust has said birth numbers in the Causeway Coast and Glens Council area have declined year-on-year.\n\nIt expect birth rates to fall in the area by 11% within the next 20 years.\n\nThe trust had said maternity services in the area were \"vulnerable and unsustainable\".\n\nThe Department of Health said: \"[The] unsustainability of the current Causeway maternity unit relates to falling birth numbers at the hospital and associated difficulties of recruiting and retaining consultants and other staff.\"\n\nThe permanent secretary said: \"An overriding priority for our health service must be the provision of safe care for our population.\n\n\"This decision is in the best interests of mothers and babies in the Northern Trust area.\"\n\nAntenatal and postnatal clinics will be retained and enhanced at Causeway Hospital\n\nHe said maintaining the current service across the Causeway and Antrim sites \"would not be sustainable\".\n\n\"Avoiding planned change would simply lead to unplanned and forced change,\" Mr May added.\n\nCauseway maternity unit has become reliant on locum and temporary staff, making the provision of consistent care more difficult.\n\nDr Dave Watkins, medical director of the Northern Health & Social Care Trust and a consultant paediatrician, said: \"Trying to run two services on two sites clearly dilutes the expertise available and the number of staff available.\n\n\"We feel that this is the safest proposal and it allows us to plan forwards for a safe, sustainable and high quality service for our women here in Antrim Hospital.\"\n\nAnne Wilson from the Royal College of Midwives said: \"We are always disappointed whenever there is a reduction in choice for mothers birthing in maternity services - so it is disappointing.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Wilson said she understood the reason behind the decision.\n\n\"I think ultimately safety of mothers and babies especially giving birth is the main goal and priority here,\" she added.\n\nThe Department of Health said: \"Conditions of the approval include making planned capacity changes at Antrim Hospital as outlined in the public consultation.\"\n\nThe trust will also be required to prioritise the development of an interim three-bedded alongside midwife-led unit at Antrim.\n\nA protest was held in Coleraine in May against the cuts to Causeway Hospital maternity services\n\nThe department said this will offer additional capacity in advance of longer-term plans for a new-build women and children's unit.\n\nSetting out the department's decision-making process, Mr May said he had reviewed the trust's consultation outcome in line with its policy and guidance on change or withdrawal of service.\n\n\"It is also consistent with the wider health transformation agenda which acknowledges that changes need to be made to ensure sustainability of services,\" he said.\n\nThe trust said it was committed to maintaining acute services and an Emergency Department at the site.\n\n\"We recognise that the hospital and its staff play a vital role in serving the local community, and we want to enhance rather than diminish that role.\"\n\nThe trust added: \"Causeway Hospital will retain its high quality antenatal and postnatal care which we recognise are critical local services for women.\n\n\"We will also be enhancing these services so that pregnant women will have access to complex antenatal care and clinics at Causeway Hospital.\"\n\nGregory Campbell, the MP for East Londonderry, said he was \"disturbed\" by the trust's explanation for the move.\n\nHe said: \"The inability to staff hospital wards and in this case a maternity unit, points to a planning and management failure more than lack of need in the community.\"\n\nMr Campbell said the Northern Trust and DoH must spell out the sustainability of the Causeway Hospital.\n\nThe proposals had been met with some opposition over the last number of months.\n\nAbout 100 people gathered in Coleraine town centre after the Northern Trust approved the recommendation to remove births from the hospital in May.\n\nIn June Mother-of-three, Heidi Wright from Portrush, said she was concerned about the length of time it would take to travel to Antrim.\n\nIn less than a year, the Northern Trust has managed to deliver a major permanent change to how one of its core services will be delivered with little fuss or opposition.\n\nIn Northern Ireland that is remarkable.\n\nWhile for decades transforming health care has been much talked about, in practice little has happened.\n\nMost recently, and in 2016, Prof Rafael Bengoa said Northern Ireland faced \"a stark choice\".\n\nThe man who chaired the last local healthcare review said people could \"either resist change and see services deteriorate to the point of collapse over time, or embrace transformation and work to create a modern sustainable service\".\n\nAt present, these two contrasting viewpoints are being played out across three different health trusts.\n\nIn the Southern and Western Trusts, resisting change over many years at Daisy Hill and the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) has now triggered a rush to transform how some services are being delivered, a move likened by the BMA to \"falling off the cliff edge\".\n\nSome have said that the change feels \"unplanned and out of control\".\n\nPoliticians have led rallies and debates in protest.\n\nBut in the Northern Trust the picture is different.\n\nOfficials have said that before maternity services get to to the point of \"collapse\" they are implementing change that is planned, deliberate and intentional.\n\nWhile all the health trusts conducted consultations, it seems that Causeway will be able to consolidate all births at Antrim Area Hospital while maintaining an antenatal and post-natal assessment hub at Causeway.\n\nIt hasn't been without some public protest - but nowhere near the extent of that seen in Enniskillen and Newry.\n\nAll other health trusts must be looking to the Northern Trust in wonder.\n\nHow did it do what the Southern and Western trusts couldn't?\n\nThe big difference, it seems, is the lack of political interference at Causeway.\n\nIn 2016, the then health minister - the DUP's Simon Hamilton - said political consensus was key to the future of NI's health service.\n\nIt seems that is much easier said than done.", "A surgeon who had to amputate a man's arm after a dog attack in Banbridge has said the victim's injuries were almost fatal.\n\nAlastair Brown, a plastic surgeon based at Belfast's Ulster Hospital, said the patient's wounds were among the worst he had seen.\n\nHe was in hospital for two months after the attack in October last year.\n\nMr Brown, who amputated the victim's left arm, said his injuries were so severe it was a case of \"life or limb\".\n\nHe added: \"Both his arms, both his legs were severely mangled by the dog and we had to make a decision very early on to save his life.\n\n\"We were able to salvage both of his legs and one of his arms.\n\n\"Unfortunately the other one was just too badly damaged.\n\n\"This was extreme.

Brecel, 28, is just the fourth non-British winner at the Crucible and the first overseas player to triumph since Neil Robertson in 2010. Brecel won six of Monday afternoon's eight frames to open up a 15-10 lead. A visibly emotional Brecel sealed victory and the \u00a3500,000 top prize by taking three frames in the evening. \"It's amazing. [Selby is] the worst opponent to have in the final. He just keeps coming back, he's such a fighter and at 16-15, I didn't fancy winning at all to be honest,\" Brecel told BBC Sport. \"I was missing balls by a mile. I don't know how I did it. Once I got to 17, I fancied it if I got a chance to clear up, which I did. It's a great feeling.\" Despite becoming the youngest player to ever participate in the tournament in 2012, aged 17 years and 45 days, the 'Belgian Bullet' had remarkably never won a single match at the famous venue until this year, losing in the first round on his five previous visits. \"Snooker is a difficult sport and in the first round [this year] I could have lost to Ricky Walden - I beat him 10-9,\" he added. \"If I'd have lost that game then everybody would have said 'he's lost again in the first round' and now I'm the winner, that's the small margins in snooker, it's crazy. I still can't believe it.\" It is a moment that has long been in the making for Brecel, who climbs eight places to finish the season second in the world rankings behind Ronnie O'Sullivan. But it only arrived after he had come through the sternest of examinations from England's four-time world champion Selby, who won five consecutive frames and scored 315 points without reply at one stage to get back to 16-15. With the tension rising Brecel knocked in a timely 51 to leave himself on the brink of victory, which he confirmed with a stylish 112 break.\n\u2022 None Snooker will explode in Europe after win - Brecel Brecel comes of age on biggest stage Luca Brecel moves up to second in the world rankings after winning the world title After losing Sunday's opening session 6-2, the manner in which Selby fought back to within one frame in the second session - a run lit up a sparkling 147 maximum break - raised significant questions about how Brecel might respond. But, resuming 9-8 in front on Monday afternoon, Brecel produced an incredible display of attacking snooker to seemingly take the match away from his opponent again, compiling four superb century breaks of 113, 101, 141 and 119. In a contest billed as a test of Brecel's mental endurance as much as his undoubted skill, few inside the Crucible Theatre could have been prepared for his blistering start. Brecel fired in doubles, a succession of stunning long pots and seemingly cleared balls at will as he rattled through the first four frames in under an hour. It was a theme that initially continued into the concluding session, Brecel making several astounding pots to craft a 67 that saw him go 16-10 ahead. Brecel's swashbuckling style has endeared him to fans across the world, in particular the manner of his famous victories over O'Sullivan and Si Jiahui on his run to the final. But when things do not go to plan the drawback is that it guarantees his opponent opportunities - and few in the game are as ruthless as Selby at capitalising on those. A wild effort on a long blue saw Selby reduce his arrears with a break of 78 and he then carved out a superb 122 on his way to reaching the mid-session interval just 16-13 adrift. Selby's charge continued with a half-century in the 30th frame and a fluked red set him on the way to winning the 31st frame. That opened up the possibility of a first Crucible finale to go the distance since Peter Ebdon's 18-17 victory over Stephen Hendry in 2002, but Brecel recovered his composure to get across the line for an emotional victory. \"I battled and gave everything but every credit to Luca he deserves it,\" said Selby, the Crucible champion in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2021. \"Congratulations to Luca, he's a great talent and a great lad with a lovely family. I wish him all the best. It was great to make a 147 at the Crucible, I never thought I would do it in a final. \"It was an amazing achievement and something I will remember for rest of my life but it's not about me today, it is about Luca, he played fantastic over the two days.\" He's been a breath of fresh air through this tournament. It's a refreshing thing to watch. He goes for his shots, he doesn't care if he misses but he pots more than he's entitled to. We talked about Mark's character this evening but how much did Luca show? To get over the line there, that's what champions do. Then in the last frame, to finish like he did with a century, the sign of a champion. Young players will be looking at that and saying 'that's the way to play, that's the way to win'. Don't hang around, don't study every shot, see the shot, go for it, trust your first instincts. It's great to see somebody play swashbuckling snooker but with balance as well and push the game to even more new limits than we thought possible.

Early morning festivalgoers arrived in their droves, offering conclusive proof that the star is no stranger to love...\n\n\"I'm here for Rick Astley,\" said Debbie Anne O'Donovan, firmly planted in the front row two hours before the singer arrived.\n\n\"I've been a big fan since the 80s. He's a bit of a legend.

Today, it's nudging 1.4 billion.\n\nThe affable star takes his internet infamy in his stride, describing RickRolling as \"brilliant\" and \"funny\".\n\n\"The video and the song have drifted off into the ether and become something else, and I'm ever so grateful for it,\" he told the Associated Press in 2022.\n\nThe star made sure everyone felt part of the performance\n\nThe notoriety encouraged him out of retirement in 2016, since when he's been on a new creative streak, producing soulful and mature pop albums like 50 and Beautiful Life.\n\nThat led to him being invited to Glastonbury in 2020, before the festival was cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\n\"I thought to myself, 'That's it, that's my shot gone',\" he told the BBC. \"I didn't think we'd get invited back because time moves on and there's new artists coming along. So I was really, completely made up when they got in touch.\"\n\nAnd the star's Glastonbury journey won't end on the Pyramid Stage.

Teachers are eligible to apply for the payments from September 2023 and March 2024.\n\nAcademies and free schools in England have been able to recruit teachers without formal teaching qualifications since 2012, when the requirement was scrapped by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government.\n\nIt is unclear if the new policy would affect private schools, which are also able to recruit teachers without formal qualifications.\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), welcomed Labour's plans but said the party could still do more.\n\n\"Schools are in the middle of a recruitment and retention crisis, so it is right that Labour should make this a high priority,\" he said.\n\n\"The ambition for every class to be taught by a qualified teacher is also welcome - every parent should be able to expect that their child is taught by someone with the requisite expertise.\n\n\"Plans to improve early career training and ongoing professional development are sensible but Labour will need to be prepared to go further if they are to begin to solve the current crisis.\n\n\"We know that issues such as uncompetitive pay and a punitive inspection system are key factors in pushing people out of the profession, and it is only by tackling these that we will see teaching and school leadership become an attractive proposition once again.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: \"We have seen yet more evidence this morning that Labour cannot be trusted on a word they say.\n\n\"Labour have flip-flopped so many times on education policy there is no guarantee they will actually stick to this latest announcement.\n\n\"Only the Conservatives are delivering on education and driving up literacy rates - putting parents and pupils first.\"", "Mothers may have been underpaid about \u00a31bn in state pension owing to information missing from their national insurance (NI) records.\n\nSince 1978, the system has included credits for parents who took time out of employment to bring up children.\n\nUntil 2010, this was known as home responsibilities protection (HRP), but it may be missing from some NI records.\n\nPeople who may be affected will receive letters from the government as part of a campaign to correct the issue.\n\nSome people affected may have died and their families will be entitled to check their eligibility and make a claim for any arrears.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and HM Revenue and Customs are working together to find people affected and correct their records so they receive the right amount of state pension.\n\nThere are high levels of uncertainty over the amount that could have been underpaid. This could range from \u00a3300m to \u00a31.5bn, the DWP has said.\n\nIts central estimate is that \u00a31bn is owed, to about 210,000 people, of which 43,000 have died. That would equate to an average shortfall of about \u00a35,000 each.\n\nIf someone claimed child benefit before May 2000 and did not provide their NI number on the claim, their NI record may not show the correct number of qualifying years of HRP, which could affect their state pension entitlement.\n\nWomen in their 60s and 70s are most likely to be affected, the government said.\n\nHMRC is using NI records to identify as many people as possible who might have been entitled to HRP between 1978 and 2010 and have no HRP credits on their NI record.\n\nIt will write to people who meet these criteria from the autumn, to find out if they are eligible to claim. If they are eligible, they can apply online.\n\nDWP will recalculate the state pension entitlement and let people know whether they are due any arrears.\n\nPension consultants LCP have been running a tool to allow people to check they are not missing out.\n\nSir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at LCP, said: \"The scale of these errors is huge. It is shocking that so many women have been underpaid so much money. This makes it essential that things are put right as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nAlice Guy, head of pensions and savings at investment platform Interactive Investor said: \"The state pension is crucially important, especially for many women who are less likely than men to have a private pension income and are more likely to be living in poverty in retirement.\"\n\nA spokesman for the government said: \"Most people's records will be unaffected, and we will shortly be launching a new online tool to help people check whether they need to claim. HMRC will also begin writing to those likely to be affected from the autumn.\n\n\"Our priority is ensuring everyone receives the financial support to which they are entitled, and state pension underpayment rates due to official error remain low at 0.5% of expenditure.

Watch: AI 'godfather' Geoffrey Hinton told the BBC earlier this month of AI dangers as he quit Google\n\nMany other experts similarly believe that fears of AI wiping out humanity are unrealistic, and a distraction from issues such as bias in systems that are already a problem.\n\nArvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has previously told the BBC that sci-fi-like disaster scenarios are unrealistic: \"Current AI is nowhere near capable enough for these risks to materialise. As a result, it's distracted attention away from the near-term harms of AI\".\n\nOxford's Institute for Ethics in AI senior research associate Elizabeth Renieris told BBC News she worried more about risks closer to the present.\n\n\"Advancements in AI will magnify the scale of automated decision-making that is biased, discriminatory, exclusionary or otherwise unfair while also being inscrutable and incontestable,\" she said. They would \"drive an exponential increase in the volume and spread of misinformation, thereby fracturing reality and eroding the public trust, and drive further inequality, particularly for those who remain on the wrong side of the digital divide\".\n\nMany AI tools essentially \"free ride\" on the \"whole of human experience to date\", Ms Renieris said. Many are trained on human-created content, text, art and music they can then imitate - and their creators \"have effectively transferred tremendous wealth and power from the public sphere to a small handful of private entities\".\n\nBut Centre for AI Safety director Dan Hendrycks told BBC News future risks and present concerns \"shouldn't be viewed antagonistically\".\n\n\"Addressing some of the issues today can be useful for addressing many of the later risks tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nMedia coverage of the supposed \"existential\" threat from AI has snowballed since March 2023 when experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, signed an open letter urging a halt to the development of the next generation of AI technology.\n\nThat letter asked if we should \"develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us\".\n\nIn contrast, the new campaign has a very short statement, designed to \"open up discussion\".\n\nThe statement compares the risk to that posed by nuclear war.

Courts in England and Wales also halted applications from firms to install them.\n\nCentrica has previously said it was \"extremely disappointed by the allegations\" surrounding one of its contractors, Avarto Financial Solutions, and added it was conducting its own investigation.\n\nMost of Centrica's bumper profits in 2022 came from its nuclear and oil and gas business, rather than its British Gas retails arm.\n\nDue to competition rules, Centrica cannot sell its own gas at a discount to British Gas customers.\n\nCentrica paid \u00a31bn in tax on its profits and of that, \u00a354m was a result of the windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - which was introduced by the government last year. The tax is designed to recoup some of the \"extraordinary\" earnings made by firms recently and help lower energy bills for households.\n\nThe government's windfall tax only applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. The current rate is 35%, but energy firms pay an additional 30% in corporation tax and a supplementary 10% rate, taking the total to 75%.\n\nHowever, companies can reduce the amount of tax paid by factoring in losses or investments. It has meant in recent years, the likes of BP and Shell have paid little or no UK tax.", "It's A Sin star Lydia West will star in the London production, which is being staged at the Barbican\n\nA new theatre production will leave its cast, crew and creative team behind when it leaves London to tour the UK.\n\nIt's A Sin star Lydia West will appear in the one-woman play about climate change at London's Barbican this week.\n\nThe show is powered by 10 cyclists on stage, who pedal constantly to generate the energy to cover the performance.\n\nBut when its London residency ends, West and the team will not take the show to its other stops. Instead, local crews will reassemble it in each area.\n\nA new regional star, director, choir and creative team will stage the same play when it opens in Coventry, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Plymouth, York and Merseyside.\n\nThe concept has been devised in an effort to discover ways to reduce the theatre industry's impact on the environment and prevent the need for travel.\n\nTen cyclists power the energy to cover the performance, with the watts being generated displayed live on a large screen\n\nA Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, written by Miranda Rose Hall, has already been successfully staged across Europe, with the concept now transferring to the UK.\n\nDirector Katie Mitchell, who has worked on productions about climate change since 2012, first launched the show in Switzerland two years ago, before it went on to play other venues around the continent.\n\n\"I suggested we did zero movement of materials and people between venues, and we would do an international tour, based on that principle,\" Mitchell tells BBC News.\n\nHall's play was then chosen for the venture, and the concept has now been picked up by UK touring company Headlong for a series of performances around England.\n\n\"It's a delicate experiment in what happens when we really try and tune in to local audiences rather than just deliver the same product around the country, which is what we normally do,\" says Holly Race Roughan, artistic director of Headlong.\n\nKatie Mitchell, director of the UK tour's London production, first launched the show in Switzerland two years ago\n\nThere is likely to be variation between the way each local group of creatives interpret and stage Hall's play - something the team see as one of the concept's main selling points.\n\n\"I don't know anything about what's going on in Coventry or Stoke-on-Trent, I'm not based there locally, I don't know the audience,\" notes Mitchell.\n\n\"So it's lovely that young directors in those cities, with a few parameters, magic up something completely different.\"\n\nRoughan adds: \"There is going to be a relationship between all the shows. Not quite twins, more like siblings.\n\n\"So if you rock up in Plymouth, you will see a show which aesthetically feels like the Barbican show or the Coventry show, but each team of local artists will be adding their twist, their take, meeting their audiences.\"\n\nEach venue is issued with a set of guidelines, one of which states that the performance should be \"off-grid\", with the electricity generated by cyclists pedalling stationary bikes during the performance.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Coldplay's most recent tour had an \"eco-friendly\" focus\n\nAcross the arts industry, an increasing number of performers and producers are trying to incorporate sustainability into their tours, as part of a larger push to be more environmentally friendly.\n\nColdplay added kinetic dance floors and energy-storing stationary bikes to their recent Music of the Spheres tour, encouraging fans to help power the show by dancing or pedalling.\n\n\"So when a frontman says 'we need you to jump up and down', when I say it, we literally really need you to jump up and down, because if you don't then the lights go out,\" singer Chris Martin told BBC News in 2021.\n\nThe group also planted a tree for every concert ticket sold, ensured their wristbands were made from compostable and plant-based plastic, encouraged fans to bring reusable bottles for the free water stations, and powered the concert from renewable energy.\n\nThe arts industry as a whole generated more than 60,338 tonnes of CO2 emissions from 2021 to 2022, according to Arts Council England's most recent annual report on culture, climate and environmental responsibility. Theatre accounted for 17% of that carbon footprint.\n\nThe bicycle technology will travel between venues, but new local volunteers will pedal during each regional performance\n\nIn addition to the sustainable concept surrounding A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, the show itself also deals with environmental themes.\n\nThe plot follows a young theatre worker who wants to stage a play about climate change as she reckons with man-made damage to the environment. It is a somewhat meta premise - essentially a play within a play.\n\n\"As a company, we're committed every year to putting on a play that either directly tackles the climate crisis, or innovates and experiments with touring in a greener way. Sometimes it can do both, which is what this project is about,\" says Headlong's Roughan.\n\nWhen the play was staged in Canada, theatre critic Savannah Stewart said: \"For a show about mass death, it expertly avoids plunging its audience into insurmountable existential dread. The message it leaves the viewer with is one of hope, not despair.\"\n\nWhile no materials travelled with the show around Europe, the bicycle technology will travel between the British venues because of limited resources in some local areas.\n\nWest (second left) previously starred in Channel 4's acclaimed drama It's A Sin, about the Aids crisis in the 1980s\n\nWatching the rehearsals taking place deep underground in the Barbican, it's striking just how much energy is required to provide the small amount of lighting and amplification required for the one-woman show.\n\nThe 10 cyclists have to pedal constantly, maintaining a certain wattage, which is displayed live on a pair of screens. And yet, the show has production values and energy consumption much lower than average.\n\n\"It's 120,000 watts for a normal Barbican show,\" Mitchell explains. \"We're going to go down to between 500 and 600 watts.\"\n\nThat means the cycling model is unlikely to be adopted for high-production musicals in the West End any time soon. But the team hope to encourage debate in the theatre industry about how to incorporate green policies into productions.\n\n\"You couldn't roll this model out easily,\" Mitchell admits. \"But it's a pioneering model, so what it's trying to do is have a conversation about touring.\n\n\"When we come to tour any show, be it a large musical or a one-woman show, can we start asking more challenging questions about the movement of people and materials between the venues?\"\n\nWest says sustainability is the direction of travel for the theatre industry. \"It's the way we need to tour in the not-so-distant future and it proves that art can be ecological and sustainable,\" she says.\n\nAn average show at the Barbican needs 120,000 watts, but Hall's play needs only around 600\n\nAlthough the public are well aware of climate change and may have made lifestyle changes as a result, getting them to come and see a worthy-sounding play about it in their leisure time could be a potential obstacle.\n\nBut Roughan says she sees the show as a slightly different proposition. \"I think it's an invitation to come and be part of imagining an alternative way of doing something,\" she says.\n\n\"By no stretch of the imagination are we saying 'OK, we've solved it, from now on in, all theatre is going to be made this way'. I think we're trying to just crack open this idea that theatre has to be made in the same way we've always made it, by using this project to catalyse.\"\n\nWest adds: \"I hope people leave feeling connected, spoken to, seen and heard and it brings the audience closer to myself and one another - and they take a fraction of that into their daily life with everything they interact with. Because we are never outside of nature.\"\n\nA Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction opens at London's Barbican on Wednesday, before touring in Coventry, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Plymouth, York and Prescot (Merseyside).", "The UK's biggest business group has admitted it hired \"culturally toxic\" staff and failed to fire people who sexually harassed female colleagues.\n\nThe CBI said a failure to act allowed a \"very small minority\" of staff to believe they could get away with harassment or violence against women.\n\nThe embattled lobby group said it has now dismissed a number of people.\n\nThe CBI was responding to an independent law firm report on misconduct allegations including rape.\n\nIn an emotional letter to members, the business lobby group - which claims to represent 190,000 firms - admitted to a series of failings and said it had made mistakes \"that led to terrible consequences\".\n\nIt said there was a collective \"sense of shame\" at \"so badly having let down the...people who came to work at the CBI\".\n\n\"Our collective failure to completely protect vulnerable employees... and to put in place proper mechanisms to rapidly escalate incidents of this nature to senior leadership.... these failings most of all drive the shame,\" CBI president Brian McBride said in the letter.\n\nIn early April, a number of claims of misconduct and harassment against CBI staff emerged including one allegation of rape at the lobby group's summer party in 2019.\n\nOn Friday a second rape allegation emerged, after a woman told the Guardian she was raped whilst working at one of the CBI's overseas offices.\n\nBoth rape allegations are being investigated by the police.\n\nIn a letter following a report by law firm Fox Williams, which was appointed to lead an independent investigation into the lobby group, the CBI admitted to its members:\n\nThe future of the CBI is hanging in the balance and it has suspended its operations until June while it tries to reform its workplace.\n\nThere has been a mass exodus of CBI members, with a number of household names including John Lewis, BMW, Virgin Media O2, insurers Aviva, Zurich and Phoenix Group, banking firm Natwest, credit card company Mastercard; B&Q owner Kingfisher and media firm ITV all quitting the group.\n\nThe government had already decided to pause any activity with the lobby group, but on Monday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said there was \"no point\" engaging with the CBI when its own members had deserted them.\n\n\"We want to engage with a body that speaks or business. It is incredibly important for me when I'm constructing budgets to have someone that I can turn to who speaks for British business.\"\n\nMr McBride said he wanted to give members reasons to consider trusting the lobby group again.\n\nBut said: \"Whether that is possible, I simply don't know.\"\n\nMr McBride said he was concerned that CBI staff felt that their only option was to go to the Guardian newspaper - which first published the claims - instead of feeling confident enough to raise the matter internally.\n\nOne female CBI worker had told the Guardian that she had been stalked by a male colleague in 2018.\n\nThe business group upheld a complaint of harassment against the man however, he was allowed to keep working in the same office as the woman. He eventually left for an unrelated reasons, according to the newspaper.\n\nEarlier this month, the lobby group fired its director-general, Tony Danker, who joined the CBI in 2020, following separate complaints of workplace misconduct.\n\nMr Danker acknowledged he had made some staff feel \"very uncomfortable\" and apologised, but said his name had been wrongly associated with separate claims andthat his reputation had been \"destroyed\".\n\nHe is being replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's former chief economist, who is returning to the lobby group after a brief stint at Barclays.\n\nDame Carolyn Fairbairn was the director-general of the CBI between 2015 and 2020. The BBC has contacted her for comment.\n\nMr McBride said the CBI had accepted all 35 recommendations made by Fox Williams investigators and added the organisation had 60 days to produce an action plan for its members to vote one.\n\nThe CBI's president said the organisation had to \"go for a much more zero-tolerance culture\" and get \"much more severe in dealing\" with incidents of bullying and sexual harassment.\n\n\"For us it's about rebuilding the trust that we obviously lost with the members who left us,\" he said.\n\nBut Andy Wood, chief executive of the brewing company Adnams, which has cancelled its membership of the CBI, said he had not heard anything so far that \"reassures me that I should become a member of the CBI again\".\n\nHe said he was not sure if the group was \"salvageable\".\n\n\"Zero tolerance of bullying and sexual harassment - that has to be a given in a modern organisation,\" Mr Wood said.\n\n\"It just shows really how archaic the CBI was behind the scenes.

Both Ms Gray and Labour have said they will abide by Acoba's recommendations.\n\nThe committee has no powers to enforce its recommendations or to punish MPs - or former MPs - who have broken the rules, but it can issue public rebukes.\n\nEarlier, an Acoba spokeswoman told the BBC \"newspaper columns are not considered significantly problematic\", but Mr Johnson was still meant to seek its advice.\n\nMr Johnson's first column details his experience with the anti-obesity medication Ozempic, which he used to try and control his weight.\n\n\"It's a cinch, said the doctor,\" he wrote. \"All you need to do is inject a tiny dose of clear Ozempic fluid into your abdomen, once a week, and hey presto \u2014 no more raiding the fridge at 11.30pm for the cheddar and chorizo washed down with half a bottle of wine.\"\n\nWhile the ex-PM hoped he was \"going to become an ex-glutton\" and \"start to resemble chiselled whippet\", things \"started to go wrong\" after a month of injections, which he puts down to \"constantly flying around the world and changing time zones\".\n\n\"For now I am back to exercise and willpower,\" he added.\n\nThe Daily Mail announced an unnamed \"erudite new columnist\" on its Friday front page\n\nThe Daily Mail Online Twitter account described Mr Johnson as \"one of the wittiest and most original writers in the business\".\n\nIn a video shared by the paper, he said: \"I am thrilled to have been asked to contribute a column to the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It is going to be completely unexpurgated stuff.\n\n\"I may even have to cover politics, but I'll obviously try to do that as little as possible unless I absolutely have to.\"\n\nIn his opening column, the former prime minister made good on that promise, steering clear of politics and the events of the past week altogether.\n\nInstead, he wrote of his experience trying a weight-loss drug which, he said, worked \"miraculously\" for one of his cabinet ministers, but not for him.\n\n\"I was going to search for the hero inside myself - the one that was three stone lighter. I was going to locate that svelte and dynamic version of Johnson, imprisoned for decades in pointless extra body weight, and I was going to set him free,\" wrote the former MP.\n\nHe said he had to give up injecting the fluid into his stomach once a week \"because they were making me feel ill\", but still believed such drugs could be \"transformative\".\n\nMr Johnson has declared millions of pounds in earnings outside Parliament since leaving No 10 last September, most of it from making speeches.\n\nIn February, the total was nearing \u00a35m.\n\nNow that he has stood down as an MP, he will not have to declare his earnings in the register of members' interests.\n\nThe committee previously found Mr Johnson broke the rules by taking up a \u00a3275,000 a year column with the Telegraph weeks after standing down as foreign secretary.\n\nIt said it was \"unacceptable\" Mr Johnson had not sought its advice before signing the contract.\n\nHis Telegraph column became an important platform for his opposition to then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, and for building support for his own leadership ambitions. He stopped writing it when he entered Downing Street in July 2019.\n\nHis new role with the Mail could give him the chance to take public pot shots at Rishi Sunak, with whom he has recently clashed over his resignation honours list.\n\nPaul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles, was rumoured to have been nominated for a peerage by Mr Johnson, but was reportedly one of the names removed during the House of Lords vetting process.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson has asked his supporters not to vote against a report that found he deliberately misled Parliament over Partygate.\n\nSeveral of his allies, including Nadine Dorries, had said they would oppose the Privileges Committee's findings in a Commons vote on Monday.\n\nIts main recommendation is that Mr Johnson should be suspended from Parliament for 90 days, but he has already resigned as an MP.", "Leonardo DiCaprio is not accused of wrongdoing, and is attending court as a witness\n\nHollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has testified in the trial of ex-Fugees rapper Pras Michel, who is accused of accepting money from a fugitive tycoon to influence US politicians.\n\nMr Michel, 50, allegedly received more than $100m (\u00a380m) from Malaysian billionaire Jho Low.\n\nHe denies a slew of charges, including conspiracy and witness tampering.\n\nMr DiCaprio, 48, who is not accused of wrongdoing in the case, was asked to testify about his links to Mr Low.\n\nMr Low is alleged to have stolen billions from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund in the 1MDB scheme, the biggest embezzlement case in history.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Mr Michel was being paid to bring \"secret, illegal foreign influence to bear\" on US politics.\n\nMr Michel is accused of making illegal contributions to Barack Obama's 2012 US presidential campaign, using an illegal network of third parties paid with foreign funds.\n\nProsecutors believe Mr Low also wanted to use Mr Michel to lobby Trump administration officials to abandon their investigation into Mr Low's alleged role in the 1MDB scheme.\n\nMr Michel and Mr Low are both facing charges in the case, but only Mr Michel is appearing in court. Mr Low is currently at large, and believed to be in China.\n\nProsecutors say the financier used his vast resources to curry favour with celebrities, including Mr DiCaprio and model Miranda Kerr.\n\nMr Low's parties also drew the likes of Alicia Keys, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.

Authorities believe those funds were embezzled from 1MDB.\n\nMr DiCaprio did not accuse Mr Michel of wrongdoing in his testimony.\n\nHe said that he first met Mr Michel in the 1990s following a Fugees concert.\n\nHe added that Mr Michel might have also attended a Thanksgiving party at his home, although \"memory does not serve\" and he could not say for sure.\n\nIn 2019 Mr DiCaprio reportedly testified before a grand jury in Washington DC as part of the justice department's investigation into the 1MDB scheme.\n\nMr DiCaprio told jurors that he lost contact with Mr Low around 2015 after being informed that he was under investigation for his financial dealings.\n\nThe Oscar-winner may not be the only celebrity to testify in Pras Michel's trial.\n\nDuring jury selection, attorneys named actors including Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and Mark Wahlberg as possible witnesses, in addition to director Martin Scorsese, according to CNN.\n\nThe sprawling case could also see testimony from former high-level US government officials and political insiders, including Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York and previously a lawyer for Mr Trump.", "Beth Morrison has campaigned on behalf of her son Calum for more than a decade\n\nA new law is being proposed following a campaign about a young man who was restrained at a special educational needs school when he was 11 years old.\n\nLabour MSP Daniel Johnson is starting a consultation on a new members' bill after what happened to Calum Morrison.

the largest of the company's 63 hospitals.\n\nMental health blogger Beth Matthews died in the Priory Group-run Cheadle Royal Hospital in 2022\n\nThe two whistleblowers told the BBC they felt the Priory Group wanted savings to be made.\n\n\"I was under so much pressure, the team was under so much pressure, everybody was running on empty,\" one told us. \"They always used to say we need to shave head count and increase productivity.\"\n\nThey said one of the main problems was employing enough staff while dealing with a huge demand for services.\n\nResponding to the BBC's investigation, mental health charity Mind said \"when someone goes into hospital for their mental health\" they deserve \"compassionate care in a therapeutic environment\".\n\nThe new findings echo a report by watchdog the CQC in December 2022. It found staff turnover was \"extremely high at 40%\" and in some services this was \"having an impact on the quality and safety of care\".\n\nThe Priory Group employs more than 14,000 staff and treats 35,000 people each year.\n\nThe whistleblower said they believed the main priority of the group's central senior management was to ensure bed occupancy was kept as high as possible.\n\nBut the whistleblowers said that, when they worked for the company, there had been \"a constant battle\" over recruitment and retention at the Priory, which meant they were \"struggling with a shortage of nurses\".\n\nWe were told some potential recruits had no interest in working with patients who had mental health conditions, while some wards were running on 100% temporary agency staff, meaning no continuity of patient care.\n\nSome agency staff, the whistleblowers told us, did not care as much as permanent staff and would do another job elsewhere, then come to the Priory for night shifts and sleep on duty.\n\nThe Priory Group declined to give a statement or do an interview, but its lawyers told the BBC the number of people requiring mental health treatment had increased.\n\nThey say waiting lists have \"spiralled\", which means the numbers of patients referred to the Priory Group \"at point of crisis\" has also risen.\n\nSometimes, they explained, the Priory Group is asked to admit - at short notice - patients the NHS cannot treat. More intensive treatment may then require transfer to a specialist ward.\n\nAll admissions, they say, \"are taken on rigorous clinical criteria, applied by medical teams at individual hospitals and not financial considerations\".\n\nThe Priory Group's lawyers stated: \"It [the company] has the right number and quality of staff before admissions are accepted, and that any suggestion of pressure put on staff is false\".\n\nThey describe turnover and staffing issues as \"endemic to the entire NHS sector\", but that turnover has now reduced month on month for the past 11 months. This, they say, is as a result of pay increases and improved benefits packages.\n\nAll Health Care Assistants (HCAs) are paid \"at least the equivalent of the Real Living Wage,\" they say, adding that over this period they have employed more than 350 extra HCAs and nurses.\n\nCEO of Mind, Sarah Hughes, said the country is in the middle of the biggest mental health crisis it has ever seen, adding: \"Workforces are overstretched and struggling to recruit, there are not enough beds and too many people are sent far from home, and many wards are not fit for purpose, they cannot offer a therapeutic environment.\"\n\nShe said the charity is calling for a statutory inquiry into failings in mental health services.\n\nWhistleblowers also told the BBC about the problem of \"completely inappropriate\" referrals, with patients sent to wards where staff could not cope with them.\n\nOne former manager believes the reason they were accepted was to ensure the company retained funding from NHS trusts and councils.\n\nAnother told us they believed the culture at the Priory's Cheadle Royal site was \"broken\".\n\nHarriet Kelly worked as a HCA at a Priory-run hospital for two years\n\nThey said head office was \"breathing down their necks\" to take more patients, some of whom were difficult to manage and were aggressive at times.\n\nThey believed the sale of the company in 2021 to private investors led to a focus on \"ever-tighter profit margins and requirements\".\n\nThat, they said, had \"taken a toll on patient care and staff morale\" as senior leaders \"put pressure on hospitals for more admissions and cost savings\".\n\nHarriet Kelly, who worked for two years as an HCA at another Priory-run hospital, also described a \"toxic\" working environment where senior managers pressured nurses to accept inappropriate referrals.\n\n\"We were constantly having patients that just weren't suitable,\" she said. \"So a lot of the time we would have patients come in that should have been in a psychiatric intensive care unit and we would be kind of pressured into accepting the admission.\"\n\nAsked why, she replied: \"To get the bed filled.\"\n\nMs Kelly said the stress of the job led her to attempt to end her own life.\n\nThe group's lawyers said they would \"never take on a patient that was too acutely unwell for their services\".\n\nIn fact, the group had, \"closed or paused hospitals or wards that could not be staffed safely or could not provide the care expected\".\n\nThey also said the current owners had committed not to take any cash out of the business for the duration of their investment in the Priory.\n\nThe CQC report from 2022 acknowledged the Priory Group had improved the pay of some staff and was appointing a director for talent acquisition.\n\nIt praised the Priory in a number of areas including learning, development and governance. It also found that in general, staff morale was good and that under the CEO who took over in 2021 there had been \"a positive culture change\".\n\nBut it concluded that, when it came to high staff turnover, \"although the Priory was aware of the challenge and had identified it as a high risk for the organisation and has taken steps to address it, there was not a clear approach for ensuring that they fully understood the reasons for the turnover and were systematically making improvements\".\n\nIt also found the mechanism for staff to raise their concerns \"was not working as it should be\".\n\nIn April 2022, in the most recent report specific to the Priory Cheadle Royal, the CQC rated it overall as \"good\".\n\nBut the CQC classified ithe Child and Adolescent Mental Health wards and aspects of the management of the hospital as \"requires improvement\".\n\nThe BBC also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the CQC asking for copies of complaints made by staff from the Priory Cheadle Royal between January 2021 and now.\n\nThe CQC confirmed it had received concerns from \"a small number of whistleblowers\" which included:\n\nLawyers for the Priory Group told the BBC there was \"overwhelming staff satisfaction with training and induction\".\n\nThey said all staff were advised to carry a key fob and/or alarm and all incidents of \"physical intervention and seclusion\" are recorded, reported to regulators and investigated.", "No new school buildings or school extensions will be started in 2023-24 due to cuts to the education budget.\n\nWork already started will continue but no new building projects will begin.\n\nA scheme to provide devices like iPads and laptops to disadvantaged pupils is also being paused.\n\nIt comes as a forum representing more than 50 public bodies, including the Education Authority (EA), said that critical services are being put at risk by the lack of a Stormont budget.\n\nThe Public Sector Chairs' Forum has written to Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris calling on him to provide a manageable way forward for public services.\n\nIt called for a strategic approach to \"protect services, provide value for money and a strong platform for reform\".\n\nThe details of a pause on new school construction work were revealed in a letter to principals from the Department of Education about funding for capital projects.\n\nCapital spending is different to day-to-day spending and pays for buildings or infrastructure.\n\nThe Department of Education (DE) has already axed a number of schemes that helped schools and pupils in advance of its 2023-24 budget being confirmed.\n\nThat included a fund for schools to help provide extra support for disadvantaged pupils.\n\nThere have been warnings that Stormont departments may face large cuts when the Northern Ireland secretary delivers the 2023-24 budget.\n\nIn a letter to school heads, the Department of Education's director of investment and infrastructure, Dr Suzanne Kingon, said a reduced capital budget and rising construction costs would mean extremely difficult decisions.\n\nShe said the indicative funding for the department's 2023-24 capital budget was \u00a3180m, a fall from the previous year.\n\n\"Regrettably, the funding we have available is about \u00a37.5m less than last year and we are continuing to encounter unprecedented increases in construction market prices,\" she said.\n\n\"At a time when a single new build post-primary school may cost upwards of \u00a340m, you will appreciate an education capital budget of \u00a3180m cannot deliver all that we would hope across a schools' estate consisting of 1,121 schools.\n\n\"The demands on the budget far exceed funding available and we are, therefore, having to make extremely difficult decisions about how best to target this funding both in the current year and going forward.\"\n\nDr Kingon said school buildings already being constructed would continue, but other planned work would be affected.\n\n\"Beyond that, our focus will be the areas of greatest need,\" she continued.\n\n\"It is unlikely we will be able to commence construction of any executive-funded new school builds or school enhancement projects.\"\n\nSchool enhancement is for school buildings costing between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a34m.\n\nSchool enhancement does not replace a whole school with a new building but can provide a school with new classrooms or other new facilities.\n\nDr Kingon said other schemes paid for from the capital budget would also be affected.\n\n\"At present, we are also unable to fund other important capital priorities, such as the roll out of digital devices for pupils in need as envisaged in the Fair Start Programme and the continued replacement of the Education Authority bus fleet.\"\n\nThe department was spending about \u00a31m a year providing schools with high numbers of pupils entitled to free school meals with new digital devices like laptops and iPads.\n\nIt followed a recommendation contained in the 2021 \"A Fair Start\" report into the impact of deprivation on education.\n\nThe department had planned to provide about 16,000 devices to about 450 schools by 2026, but that timetable is now unlikely to be met.\n\nDr Kingon said about \u00a370m would be spent on emergency repairs to schools and creating extra school places for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in 2023-24.\n\nHowever, the Education Authority has previously said that there is a backlog for school maintenance and repairs in Northern Ireland of about \u00a3500m.", "Millions across North America are breathing the hazardous air from the wildfires in Canada.

Value added tax (VAT), a tax we all pay on many things we buy, and while most food is VAT free, it does get slapped on some snacks - and being wise to its weird ways could save you some money.\n\nThe Treasury said it applied VAT relief on items including food, public transport and property rental.\n\nKemi Nevins ran a caf\u00e9 in Cardiff for many years and said getting to grips with VAT rules was a challenge.\n\n\"It's a shopping nightmare, really, and you've got to be a very savvy shopper to know all the little ways of saving money,\" she said.\n\n\"It sounds crazy but you can have crisps made from potato which have standard rate VAT, that's 20% on top, but if you like your corn chips they're zero rated. So it's a no-brainer, get the corn chips.\"\n\nFormer caf\u00e9 owner Kemi Nevins said getting to grips with VAT rules was a \"shopping nightmare\"\n\nSo what about biscuits? Well there is no VAT to pay on them unless they are wholly or partially covered in chocolate, in which case there is an extra 20% in tax.\n\nBut, if the chocolate is inside the biscuit, for example a chocolate chip cookie or if it is sandwiched in between two halves of a biscuit, there is no VAT to pay.\n\nClear as mud, or chocolate, right?\n\nHere is a handy guide to some of the deeply confusing rules on the VAT status of some popular snacks.\n\nRemember that sometimes stores will have offers where the products subject to 20% VAT may end up being the cheaper option - so it is always worth checking prices before you buy.\n\nOverall in Wales we pay more VAT than income tax and for hundreds of thousands of people it is the single biggest tax they pay.\n\nGuto Ifan, an economist at the Wales Governance Centre, has been crunching the numbers.\n\nHe said: \"About 46% of adults don't pay income tax which means that inevitably they'll pay more through the VAT system.\"\n\nAs a tax on spending, VAT takes a bigger chunk out of the disposable incomes of the poorest households compared to the richest, though the overall UK tax and benefits system does redistribute money from the richest to the poorest.\n\nBut the debate over whether that system is generous enough to people on low incomes is a constant political debate, especially given the current cost of living pressures.\n\nThe Labour MP for the Cynon Valley, Beth Winter, wants to see changes to the entire tax system and sad VAT was particularly unfair.\n\n\"We live in a very unequal country and this indirect tax clearly impacts the poorest in society much more than the wealthy and it needs changing,\" she said.\n\nMP Beth Winter said the current tax system impacts the poorest in society more\n\nBut Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said VAT reform on its own could not provide extra support for the poorest.\n\n\"If you want additional progressivity in the tax system, which you may well do, the VAT system is not the place to look for it,\" he said.\n\n\"You need to look through wealth taxes, income taxes, capital gains taxes, all those sorts of things. Or indeed through the welfare system, by increasing benefits.\"\n\nThe sheer complexity of VAT, which applies to most of the goods and services we buy, has led to many court cases and often makes it a magnet for ridicule as well criticism.\n\nChoosing a chocolate chip cookie over a chocolate covered one could mean you avoid paying tax\n\nIn one case, more than 20 years ago, Lord Justice Sedley said: \"Beyond the everyday world\u2026 lies the world of VAT a kind of fiscal theme park in which factual and legal realities are suspended or inverted.\"\n\nVAT has been with us for 50 years and it is a now major source of income for the UK government raising \u00a3143bn in 2021-22.\n\nIn responding to calls for reform, the Treasury said: \"We recognise households should not have to bear all the VAT costs they incur and apply generous VAT reliefs on items like food, public transport and property rental.\"\n\nThey say that means \"45% of economic activity is not subject to VAT\".", "Colin Beattie said he would co-operate fully with the police inquiry\n\nColin Beattie has resigned as SNP treasurer after his arrest as part of a police investigation into the party's finances.\n\nHe said he would also be stepping back from his role on the public audit committee until the police investigation had concluded.\n\nThe 71-year-old was taken into custody and released without charge on Tuesday.\n\nIt came hours before First Minister Humza Yousaf set out his government's priorities for the next three years.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Beattie said he had resigned as treasurer with \"immediate effect\".\n\nHe said: \"On a personal level, this decision has not been easy, but it is the right decision to avoid further distraction to the important work being led by Humza Yousaf to improve the SNP's governance and transparency.\n\n\"I will continue to co-operate fully with Police Scotland's inquiries and it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on a live case.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said the resignation was \"the right thing to do\" and that a new treasurer would be appointed as soon as possible.\n\nPolice Scotland launched its Operation Branchform investigation into the SNP's finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations were used.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

It would not be appropriate for me to do so.\"\n\nMr Yousaf has dismissed calls for Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell and Mr Beattie to be suspended from the party while the police investigation is ongoing, saying he believes in people being innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThe party raised \u00a3666,953 through referendum-related appeals between 2017 and 2020 with a pledge to spend these funds on the independence campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nOfficers involved in the investigation spent two days searching the couple's Glasgow home and the party's headquarters in Edinburgh earlier this month.\n\nThere was an inevitability about this announcement. It was hard to imagine Colin Beattie continuing as SNP treasurer while under police investigation.\n\nHe announced the decision to quit after a conversation with Humza Yousaf who says it was the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, opposition parties say Mr Yousaf should have removed Colin Beattie as treasurer and gone further in suspending him from the SNP.\n\nIt means that Humza Yousaf is in temporary charge of the SNP's finances but he told me he's got enough on his plate and wants someone else appointed to the role as soon as possible.\n\nThe party faces major challenges as the police investigation into its finances continues, including trying to find new auditors to replace those that quit seven months ago.\n\nA luxury motorhome was seized by officers from outside a property in Dunfermline on the same morning Mr Murrell was arrested.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday reported that the vehicle had been parked outside the home of Mr Murrell's 92-year-old mother since January 2021. It has since been moved to a police compound in Glasgow.\n\nLeaked video footage published by the Sunday Mail at the weekend showed Ms Sturgeon playing down fears about the party's finances in a virtual meeting of the party's ruling body in March 2021.\n\nThe SNP's former Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has insisted that there was \"nothing untoward\" in the clip and claimed that the party's finances are in \"robust health\".\n\nThe motorhome was transferred to a police compound in Govan on Tuesday\n\nBut the Sunday Times has reported that Mr Beattie told the NEC at the weekend that the SNP was struggling to balance its books due to a drop in member numbers and donors.\n\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said Mr Beattie's resignation was the \"right decision made by the wrong man\".\n\nShe said there had been a \"culture of secrecy\" within the SNP and criticised Humza Yousaf's decision not to suspend those subject to police inquiries.\n\nScottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said Mr Yousaf is being \"consumed by the chaos wracking his party\".\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy added the priorities of Scotland were being ignored as a result of SNP \"chaos\".", "Motsi Mabuse admitted she asks fellow Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood for help understanding some northern people\n\nStrictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse has said she struggles to understand the accents of people from the north of England.\n\nMabuse, who speaks five languages, admitted she has to \"really concentrate\" when making conversation in the UK.\n\nShe added that fellow Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood helps translate when an accent is \"too strong\".\n\nMabuse grew up in South Africa but now lives in Germany.\n\nSpeaking to comedians Ed Gamble and James Acaster on their Off Menu podcast, the 41-year-old said: \"The thing is, you [Britons] all speak differently.\n\n\"Every time I'm in the country I really have to concentrate.\n\n\"Some people I just don't know \u2026 I'm just like, 'Are we speaking the same language?'\n\n\"There's a lot of accents here.\"\n\nMabuse was then asked if she struggled with contestant AJ Odudu's Blackburn dialect during series 19 of the dance reality show back in 2021.\n\n\"Yes!

This is achieved by using centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds - to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235.\n\nLow-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.\n\nHighly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more.\n\nUnder the nuclear deal, Iran agreed not to enrich uranium beyond the 3.67% purity and to halt enrichment altogether at Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant.\n\nAfter the US reinstated sanctions, it first resumed enrichment to 20% and then started producing smaller quantities of 60%-enriched material too - a significantly higher level than it had reached before.\n\nThe IAEA's latest quarterly report to member states said inspectors found the 83.7%-enriched uranium particles in samples taken at Fordo in late January.\n\nThe head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran played down the significance of the discovery and said he expected it to be \"put to rest\" soon.\n\nMohammad Eslami told reporters on Wednesday that the sample was \"just a particle that cannot even be seen with a microscope\" and insisted that \"the important thing is the volume of product stored\" after enrichment, according to the official Irna news agency.\n\nIran insists that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful, but experts have warned that the breaches have theoretically reduced the time it would take the country to acquire enough weapons-grade uranium for one bomb if it decided to do so.\n\nTop US defence department official Colin Kahl told a Congressional committee hearing on Tuesday that this so-called \"breakout time\" had been shortened from 12 months to \"about 12 days\".\n\nExperts estimate that \"weaponization\" - manufacturing a nuclear warhead for a missile - would still take another one to two years.", "Jason Cunningham and his partner Bec have two children together\n\nBoxer turned trainer Jason Cunningham, who won British, European and Commonwealth titles during a 12-year professional career, is no stranger to fighting.\n\nBut after the birth of the 34-year-old's son four months premature, he and his family have had to gear up for a completely different sort of battle - one completely out of their hands.\n\nJason's partner, Bec, also 34, only found out in mid-March that she was five months pregnant with the couple's second child together.\n\nThat discovery came a week before the ex-boxer's first fight as a head trainer was due to take place.\n\nDays later, after experiencing stomach pains, Bec went into labour and gave birth to Cheance John Cunningham on 19 March at Hull Royal Infirmary.\n\nCheance weighed just 1.5 lbs (680g) - little more than a pair of boxing gloves.\n\nThe couple, from Woodlands in Doncaster, were told Cheance had a 45% chance of survival - which inspired their choice of name for the new addition to the family.\n\n\"It was a massive shock,\" said Bec, a mother of two daughters, including 17-month-old Talia who she had with Jason.\n\n\"I don't think we really got a chance to get our heads around it.\"\n\nHowever, Jason, who also has a daughter from a previous relationship, said that Cheance was now \"improving day by day\".\n\n\"He's in the best hands with the best care possible,\" he added.\n\n\"There's nothing we can do.

Interest rates rose sharply and Britain went into recession.\n\nNigel Lawson with his daughter Nigella in 2008\n\nDuring his tenure Thatcher called Lawson \"unassailable\", but he resigned in 1989, after falling out with her over Europe.\n\nHe stepped down as an MP at the 1992 election before entering the House of Lords as Lord Lawson of Blaby, only retiring last December.\n\nLawson used his platform in the Lords to express scepticism of man-made climate change.\n\nIn 2016 he became the chairman of Vote Leave, the group which led the campaign for the UK's exit from the EU. He described Brexit as a \"historic opportunity\" to finish the job Thatcher had started.\n\nOne of his most eye-catching recent political interventions was his backing of Mr Sunak over Ms Truss in last summer's Conservative leadership contest, when he said Ms Truss's tax-cutting plans were not in the Thatcherite tradition and would risk going back to the mistakes of the 1970s.\n\nThe financial market turmoil which followed the package of tax cuts announced in September's mini-budget will be cited by his admirers as evidence of the lasting quality of his economic judgement.", "Video shot by an eyewitness appears to show a person firing a weapon through a window at a Jehovah's Witness centre in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nSeven people, including an unborn baby, were killed in the attack in the German city of Hamburg, police say.\n\nThey say the gunman acted alone on Thursday evening, and later took his own life.

In a witness statement previously reported, the prince claimed Ms Davy decided that \"a royal life was not for her\" following repeated acts of harassment.\n\nThe court was also told about a 2003 article detailing an alleged row between the duke and his brother Prince William, now the Prince of Wales, over their mother's ex-butler Paul Burrell.\n\n\"Brothers can sometimes disagree,\" Mr Sherborne said.\n\n\"But once it is made public in this way and their inside feelings revealed in the way that they are, trust begins to be eroded.\"\n\nChelsy Davy and Prince Harry were in an on-off relationship between 2004 and 2010\n\nThe prince alleges about 140 articles published between 1996 and 2010 contained information gathered using unlawful methods, and 33 of these have been selected to be considered at the trial.\n\nAt the start of the High Court hearing last month, the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People admitted a private investigator had been instructed to unlawfully gather information relating to Harry's conduct in a nightclub in February 2004.\n\nThis incident does not form part of the duke's claim for breach of privacy.\n\nMr Sherborne told the court on Monday the suggestion that there was only one instance of unlawful information-gathering was \"plainly implausible\", arguing it would have happened on \"multiple occasions\".\n\nHe said \"every facet\" of the prince's life had been splashed across the papers and it would have been \"obvious\" stories about his private life were driving sales for MGN.\n\nBut Mr Green said there was no evidence to support claims by the prince.\n\nSummarising MGN's defence, Mr Green said there was no data showing that Harry had been hacked, \"still less on a habitual basis\".\n\nMr Green said none of the whistle-blowing journalists who have come forward admitting phone hacking said they had hacked the prince's phone.\n\n\"There's no evidence to support a finding that any mobile phone owned or used by the Duke of Sussex was hacked.

Wael Sawan says the world \"continues to desperately need oil and gas\"\n\nCutting oil and gas production would be \"dangerous and irresponsible\", the boss of energy giant Shell has told the BBC.\n\nWael Sawan insisted that the world still \"desperately needs oil and gas\" as moves to renewable energy were not happening fast enough to replace it.\n\nHe warned increased demand from China and a cold winter in Europe could push energy prices and bills higher again.\n\nMr Sawan angered climate scientists who said Shell's plan to continue current oil production until 2030 was wrong.\n\nProfessor Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist at the University of Cambridge, said firms such as Shell should focus on accelerating the green transition \"rather than trying to suggest the most vulnerable in society are in any way best served by prolonging our use of oil and gas\".\n\nHead of the UN Ant\u00f3nio Guterres recently said investment in new oil and gas production was \"economic and moral madness\".\n\nMr Sawan told the BBC: \"I respectfully disagree.\" He added: \"What would be dangerous and irresponsible is cutting oil and gas production so that the cost of living, as we saw last year, starts to shoot up again.\"\n\nThe world is in a race to ditch fossil fuels in favour of greener alternatives as globally leaders have pledged to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C this century.\n\nLast year the European Commission outlined how the EU would speed up its shift to green energy to end its dependency on Russian oil and gas.\n\nMany countries do not have the infrastructure to move to more sustainable forms of energy.\n\nMr Sawan said an international bidding war for gas last year saw poorer countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh unable to afford liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments that were instead diverted to Northern Europe.\n\n\"They took away LNG from those countries and children had to work and study by candlelight,\" he said. \"If we're going to have a transition it needs to be a just transition that doesn't just work for one part of the world.\"\n\nClaire Fyson, co-head of climate policy at Climate Analytics, a global science and policy institute, told the BBC: \"The idea that it's a choice between our addiction to fossil fuels or working by candlelight is a gross misrepresentation of reality, when we know renewables are cleaner, cheaper and better for public health.\"\n\nThe UK has pledged to spend \u00a311.6bn on international climate finance but a memo seen by the BBC said economic shocks like the Covid pandemic had \"turned a stretching target into a huge challenge\".\n\nThe head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has said that \"if governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal from now\".\n\nHere are some energy saving ideas from environmental scientist Angela Terry, who set up One Home, a social enterprise that shares green, money-saving tips:\n\nShell has a long history and a headquarters in the UK. But Mr Sawan said a lack of clarity and stability on energy policy and taxation risked making the UK a less attractive place to invest compared with more welcoming countries. The UK has increased tax on UK-derived profits from 40% to 75% until 2028 unless oil and gas prices fall below thresholds for a sustained period - which most energy experts doubt will happen.\n\nThe UK currently imports more than half of its oil and gas - and that proportion is expected to rise without renewed investment in the North Sea. Shell recently decided to sell its stake in a major new undeveloped oil field at Cambo.\n\n\"Ultimately the government needs to make a call as to their views on imported versus domestic production,\" said Mr Sawan.\n\n\"When you do not have the stability you require in these long-term investments, that raises questions when we compare that to other countries where there is very clear support for those investments.\"\n\nMr Sawan was also keen to stress the warm welcome extended to the company by the New York Stock Exchange at a recent investors' meeting where they laid out their plans to cut costs and maximise profits.\n\n\"The welcome we had there was exemplary. The Shell flag was waving next to the New York Stock Exchange flag,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the officials there had underlined his feeling that the US was more supportive of oil and gas companies.\n\n\"They said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need. That resonated with me as a person who comes from Lebanon where we are starved of energy.\"\n\nMr Sawan did not rule out moving Shell's headquarters and stock market listing to the US. American oil companies command higher prices for their shares - Exxon Mobil for example is worth 40% more than Shell per dollar of profit.\n\n\"There are many who question whether that valuation gap can only be bridged if we move to the US. A move of headquarters is not a priority for the next three years.\"\n\nBut after that? \"I would never rule out anything that could potentially create the right circumstances for the company and its shareholders. Ultimately, I am in the service of shareholder value,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Shell says it has no plans to move in the short term, Mr Sawan's comments will add to fears that London's stock market is losing its lustre as a venue for multinational companies to raise money after technology darling Arm Holdings recently announced plans to move its primary listing to the US.\n\nA move by the UK's most valuable company to the US would seriously dent Britain's financial prestige and cost jobs in the financial services sector.", "Jurors were read transcripts from police interviews with Kevin Spacey during the prosecution's final day of evidence in his sex assault trial.\n\nThe actor was questioned five times by Met Police officers in New York and London in 2019. He was not under arrest during the interviews.\n\nSpacey, 63 said he was \"baffled\" by one allegation and didn't recognise two of his accusers, the court heard.\n\nThe Hollywood star denies 12 alleged sex offences between 2001 and 2013.\n\nJurors at Southwark Crown Court have heard evidence from four men who claim the actor attacked them, as well as witnesses supporting their accusations.\n\nBarrister Shauna Ritchie ended the prosecution's case by telling the court how Spacey told police he didn't recognise a man who claims to have been assaulted in the actor's flat.\n\nThe man alleges he went to the actor's flat seeking career advice, and woke up with Spacey performing a sex act on him.\n\nHe told police he would \"never\" have performed a sex act on anyone without their consent, adding: \"I have had a number of consensual one-night stands with many members of the theatre world in my property.\"\n\nSpacey also said he did not recognise another complainant, who alleges Spacey grabbed him \"like a cobra\" after they met at a West End theatre.\n\nHe told police he was \"deeply hurt\" and \"baffled\" by accusations from another accuser, who says he was made to swerve his car off the road when Spacey grabbed him while he was driving.\n\nThe actor said he may have made a \"clumsy pass\" at his final alleged victim but denied deliberately attacking him.\n\nThe interviews were conducted voluntarily with the actor and his attorneys.\n\nSpacey has been described as a \"predator\" and a \"sexual bully\" during previous hearings over incidents which allegedly took place in the UK.\n\nThe American spent time living in London during his stint as the director of the Old Vic theatre between 2004 and 2015.\n\nDuring cross-examination of witnesses, Spacey's defence team questioned the motivations and integrity of his accusers, including that they are seeking financial gain.\n\nSpacey pleaded not guilty in January to three counts of indecent assault, three counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.\n\nHe also previously denied four further charges of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.\n\nAll four accusers are entitled to lifelong anonymity under the law.", "Football clubs should think about the impact on fans when accepting sponsorships from gambling firms, the head of NHS England has said.\n\nAmanda Pritchard said the deals send a message to children that gambling was OK.\n\nHer comments came after the news that the NHS is nearly doubling the number of gambling addiction clinics to 15 after a record number of referrals.\n\nSome 1,389 patients were referred for gambling support in 2022-23.\n\nThis is up from 775 two years prior.\n\nSeven new facilities are to be opened this summer on top of the eight already open.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Ms Pritchard described severe gambling addiction as a \"cruel disease\" and a \"life destroyer\".\n\n\"It would be really great to see the gambling industry, and also organisations like football clubs, really think seriously about their responsibilities here,\" she said.\n\nShirt sponsorship deals mean \"that it's kids that are seeing every day now messages that say gambling is OK\", she says.\n\nShe also highlighted the fact people can bet every hour of the day on their mobile phones, leading to a \"really significant increase\" in demand for NHS gambling addiction services.\n\nIn a separate statement to announce the new clinics, Ms Pritchard said children and adults were being \"bombarded\" with gambling adverts.\n\nThe NHS announcement follows a coroner's verdict on Thursday that one betting firm could have done more to help a gambler who took his own life in 2021 after amassing huge debts.\n\nThe company in question, Betfair, said it had met all the regulatory standards which were in place at the time, but conceded in hindsight that it should have done more.\n\nMeanwhile, a campaign group this week urged the UK government to \"step in\" after three Premier League clubs announced new shirt sponsorship deals with betting firms.\n\nWhen the full set of 15 NHS facilities are open across England, the health service hopes to be able to treat 3,000 patients a year, using techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\n\nThe seven new clinics are in Blackpool, Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Milton Keynes, Sheffield, and Thurrock in Essex.\n\nThese are in addition to others already running in London, Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent and Telford.\n\nAn eighth clinic in London exists to treat not only gambling but also gaming addiction in children and young people.\n\nPublic health minister Neil O'Brien said the government had set out plans to tackle gambling, including a commitment to introduce a statutory levy so gambling companies pay their \"fair share\" towards treatment services.\n\nThe publication of the government's white paper in April marked the biggest shake-up of regulation in the sector since the advent of the smartphone.\n\nAmong the measures proposed were a stake limit of \u00a32 on online slot machines for young gamblers - but campaigners attacked a lack of action on adverts.\n\nThe new addiction facilities were described as \"heartening\" by the charity Gambling with Lives, whose strategy director Will Prochaska said the clinics \"couldn't come at a more pertinent moment, whilst gambling advertising lures more people into harm\".\n\nThe announcement was also welcomed by Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling, who said the current business model was built on \"harm\".\n\nThe Lib Dems said news of record addiction referrals showed the Conservatives were not doing enough to protect gamblers.\n\n\"Far too many people are suffering from gambling harms,\" said health spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP, accusing the government of \"dragging their feet\" on the issue.\n\n\"These new figures must be a wake-up call to ministers to stop dithering and act now, before more lives are ruined.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article you can visit the BBC's Action Line for information and support.", "Last updated on .From the section Man City\n\nManchester City have been crowned Premier League champions for the third successive season after title rivals Arsenal lost at Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Gunners, top for the majority of the campaign, are four points behind City with only one game left to play after being beaten 1-0 on Saturday.\n\nPep Guardiola's side have won the title in five of the past six campaigns.\n\nThey also have a chance to claim the Treble, with FA Cup and Champions League finals to come next month.\n\nOnly Manchester United, in 1998-99, have previously achieved that feat - and it is their derby rivals whom City will meet at Wembley on 3 June, before facing Inter Milan a week later in Istanbul, where they will hunt a first Champions League triumph.\n\nCity will lift the trophy after they play Chelsea on Sunday (16:00 BST).\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan - who has scored four goals in the past two league games - said: \"The Premier League is without doubt the most demanding and competitive league in the world, so that tells you everything about what an achievement this is.\n\n\"To have won this trophy three times in a row and five times in six years is incredible. That quality and consistency helps sum up what Manchester City stand for and ensures the club will continue to strive for success going forward.\n\n\"It has been a season I will never forget.\"\n\nCity, champions for a ninth time in the club's history, had trailed Arsenal by eight points on 7 April, although they had played one game fewer than Mikel Arteta's leaders at that point.\n\nIt is only the fourth time that a team has been as many as eight points clear after at least 28 Premier League games and failed to win the title.\n\nOnly one team has ever had 69 points with 10 games remaining - as Arsenal did - and failed to win the title. That was Liverpool in 2018-19, when they finished on 97 points, one behind City.\n\nBut City have won 11 league games in a row - and dropped just two points from a possible 42 - to overhaul Arsenal and clinch the title with three games remaining.\n\n\"Arsenal have pushed us right to the limit,\" said full-back Kyle Walker. \"They've been fantastic and full credit to them, but I think we just went on an incredible run, and we've managed to end up where we have now. They've had a few hiccups and we've managed to capitalise on that.\n\n\"It's the players we've got. We're a bunch of lads who have achieved so much over the last number of years and we understand the standards we've set.\"\n\u2022 None 'An unstoppable juggernaut' - where will Man City dominance end?\n\nCity are only the fifth club to win three successive top-flight titles in England, following Huddersfield Town (1924-26), Arsenal (1933-35), Liverpool (1982-84) and Manchester United, who did it twice under Sir Alex Ferguson (1999-2001 and 2007-09).\n\nIt is also the third occasion Guardiola has managed to win three league titles in a row, having done so in La Liga with Barcelona from 2009-11 and in the Bundesliga from 2014-16 with Bayern Munich.\n\nCity's Premier League dominance of five titles in six seasons was last achieved by Manchester United between 1996 and 2001 - a period where they also won the Treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.\n\nUnited also won seven titles in nine seasons between 1993-2001; as well as five titles in seven seasons between 2007-2013 - so City's current dominance is not unprecedented.\n\nBefore that, Liverpool in the late 1970s and early '80s enjoyed similar periods of league success.\n\nCity will complete their league campaign with away games against Brighton and Brentford, before resuming their Treble bid.\n\nTheir push for that achievement has been driven, in part, by Erling Haaland's remarkable goalscoring record since the forward joined from Borussia Dortmund last summer.\n\nThe 22-year-old Norwegian has scored 52 goals in 48 games in all competitions - including a record-breaking 36 goals in 33 Premier League appearances.\n\nHaaland is just the second player in English top-flight history to score more than 50 times in all competitions - and the first to do so for 95 years.\n\nHe broke the Premier League record for goals in a season with his 35th at the start of March, which moved him one clear of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer - whose 34-goal tallies had come in a 42-match campaign.\n\nThe title win comes three months after City were charged by the Premier League with more than 100 breaches of its financial rules following a four-year investigation. The charges cover the period of 2009-2018, since the 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, led by billionaire Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.\n\nThey are accused of effectively falsifying their accounts and artificially inflating sponsorship and commercial deals over a number of years to allow them to spend more but stay within Uefa and Premier League rules.\n\nCity said they were \"surprised by the charges\" but welcomed the \"review of this matter by an independent commission to impartially consider\" their case, which City said was supported by a \"comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\".\n\nCity, who have always denied financial wrongdoing, said they \"look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all\".\n\nThe club has been referred to an independent commission, which can impose punishments ranging from a fine and points deduction to expulsion from the Premier League.

But at Port Sudan she was told she could not be airlifted out the country as she was not \"immediate family\".\n\nThey are now stuck at the Sudanese border attempting to leave.\n\nDr Yahya said: \"My mother doesn't have anyone to look after her.

Family of aid worker killed in Gaza: 'He had a desire to serve others'\n\nJacob Flickinger was a \"loyal and devoted\" aid worker and family man who was \"chased down\" and killed by Israel while trying to help those in need, his parents have told the BBC.\n\nMr Flickinger, 33, a US-Canadian, was one of seven people killed in a strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy.\n\nIsrael's military apologised and called the attack a tragic mistake. It has promised a full investigation.\n\nHis parents however said that his death was a \"crime\" and rejected the apology.\n\nJohn Flickinger and Sylvia Labrecque said there was a \"hole in their hearts\", and that Jacob's wife Sandy and 18-month old son Jasper were bereft without a husband and father.\n\nSpeaking from Quebec, they said he and the other workers were killed while travelling on a road designated by Israel as a safe humanitarian route.\n\nMr Flickinger said the charity had reported 24 hours in advance that their convoy would be dropping food at a warehouse, and stayed in touch with the Israel Defense Forces throughout the process,\n\nBut still Israel attacked and \"they continued firing until all the workers were dead,\" he said. \"Israel owes the families and the world an explanation.\"\n\nMr Flickinger's father described him as a \"the best, most loyal friend you could ask for\"\n\nHis mother, Ms Labrecque, said that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's description of the attack as a \"tragic accident\" was - in her view - \"a joke\".\n\n\"He was such a good human being,\" she said of her son. \"He was extremely devoted to his work and his family.\"\n\nJacob, who had previously served 11 years in the armed forces, went to Gaza in March out of a desire to help others, his family said.\n\n\"His life has been about service,\" said Mr Flickinger, adding that even despite this, he was worried about his son travelling through a war zone as dangerous as Gaza.\n\n\"But [Jacob] felt the World Central Kitchen knew what they were doing there,\" he said, and his son \"knew that people were starving out there\".\n\nHis parents called on the US to stop sending military aid to Israel while the country was using \"food as a weapon\" - a reference to the lack of aid getting into Gaza.\n\n\"The US has great leverage over Israel,\" Mr Flickinger said.\n\nJacob's parents also called for a ceasefire, a return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas and for more aid to war-torn Gaza.\n\nMr Flickinger also said he wanted the US government to launch an independent investigation into the killings of humanitarian workers, as well as for Israel to pay reparations to relatives who have lost loved ones in Gaza.\n\n\"Justice can start there, but most critically, end this insanity,\" he said.\n\n\"I grew up without having a father,\" Mr Flickinger said. \"Now my grandson will grow up without having his father.\"\n\nMs Labrecque said she hoped their grandson, Jasper, would serve as a reminder of their son's life and goodness.\n\n\"It's going to be a day-to-day job, to heal from that loss,\" she said. \"But Jasper will be a very good inspiration for us to stay strong.\"\n\nMr Flickinger said that he had spoken to the Canadian government, but had not heard from the White House. He said he was told about his son's death from the US embassy in Israel.\n\n\"I would like to hear from someone in the US government,\" he said, adding that the Canadian government had been \"very helpful\".\n\nWCK - founded by the famous Spanish-American chef Jose Andr\u00e9s - was one of the main suppliers of desperately needed aid to Gaza, where more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the 7 October Hamas attacks.\n\nAround 200 humanitarian workers in total have been killed in the conflict, according to aid groups.\n\nAbout 1,200 Israelis were killed and 253 hostages were taken by Hamas in its 7 October attack on Israel.", "Humza Yousaf has said he expects businesses to demand compensation from the UK government if Scotland's deposit return scheme does not go ahead.\n\nThe first minister said Westminster had put his government in a \"really difficult position\".\n\nCircular economy minister Lorna Slater has warned that without a Scottish exemption from the UK's Internal Market Act, the Scottish scheme could be axed.\n\nThe UK government is still considering the exemption request.\n\nThe deposit return scheme - which is aimed at increasing the number of single-use drinks bottle and cans that are recycled - requires Westminster to grant an exemption to the UK-wide Internal Market Act, given its possible implications for business elsewhere in the UK.\n\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland the scheme \"could be unviable\" if the exemption request is not granted by the end of the month.\n\nHe said: \"If we don't get it this month we have been told by Circularity Scotland, the operator of the scheme, that the scheme could be unviable.\n\n\"There's no reason for the UK government not to grant that exemption.

We inspect first and foremost in the interests of children, but we aim for all our inspections to be carried out professionally and sensitively, with careful regard to their impact on school staff.\"\n\nOfsted has promised it will look at revisiting schools more quickly where concerns could be addressed easily, and it has reminded head teachers they can draw on the support of colleagues.\n\nA spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said work-related suicide could not be reported to it under existing regulations: \"Our thoughts are with everyone who knew Ruth Perry.

We thought those days were over,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\nBBC News NI understands the alert was prompted by a note left at the gates of the council-run Henry Jones playing fields on the outskirts of east Belfast.\n\nA police spokesperson said: \"Police received information concerning the pitches and took proactive steps to ensure the area was safe.\"\n\nThe security operation began on Monday evening and police and Army technical officers were deployed to the scene.\n\nMembers of the public were asked to avoid the area and road closures were put in place.\n\nLater, officers said they had found \"nothing untoward\".\n\nThere was a large police presence in the area on Tuesday\n\nEast Belfast GAA started in May 2020 and was the first GAA club in the east of the city in almost 50 years.

criticised Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) council candidate Anne Smyth for a statement released on social media last week.\n\nShe said comments about the club's former president, Linda Ervine, who also runs Irish language classes, were \"unnecessary\".\n\n\"Anne Smyth was running as a councillor in my constituency, in Titanic, so it was very uncomfortable to see some of those comments made not only towards us but towards Linda,\" Ms Robertson said.\n\nIn the statement Ms Smyth expressed \"GAA expansionism concerns\" surrounding the Henry Jones playing fields and criticised Ms Ervine \"for her attempts to persuade east Belfast people to learn Gaelic\".\n\n\"Anne's comments were unnecessary and they were inflammatory, in our opinion, they put our members at risk,\" Ms Robertson continued.\n\nA TUV spokesman said the party condemned the security alert.\n\n\"The good folk of east Belfast do not need or want such incidents and we would urge anyone with information to come forward to the PSNI,\" he said.\n\n\"Anne Smyth's comments are a completely different matter and related to how the use of playing fields had been gifted by a Sinn F\u00e9in dominated City Council to the detriment of other sports,\" he added.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) told BBC News NI it was aware of the social media post and was looking at the content.\n\nIn a statement, Belfast City Council said four existing grass pitches Henry Jones were being reconfigured to create \"one soccer pitch and one GAA pitch\".\n\nIt added that \"extensive engagement has taken place as

bathhouse on the eastern side of Birdoswald will be covered again at the end of the summer\n\nVisitors wanting to see the remains of a Roman bathhouse have just a few weeks left before it is covered over again.\n\nThis summer's excavation of settlements around Birdoswald Fort on Hadrian's Wall in Cumbria will be the largest since the 1990s.\n\nA previously-unearthed bathhouse said to be a significant find will be reburied at the end of the season for preservation.\n\nHistoric England and Newcastle University are investigating the site.\n\nTony Wilmott, senior archaeologist for Historic England, said previous discoveries had led to a greater knowledge about the towns that grew up either side of the fort, which was built between AD 122 and 138.\n\nAbout 800 soldiers, originally from the Romania area, were based at the five-acre fort, which sits between modern-day Haltwhistle and Brampton, with towns setting up around it.\n\nAbout 800 soldiers were based at Birdoswald Roman fort about 1,900 years ago\n\n\"These were not just shanty towns but proper settlements with stone buildings,\" Mr Wilmott said.\n\nThe size of the towns was first revealed in the 1990s by geophysical surveys with subsequent digs revealing more.\n\nMr Wilmott said fields to the north, east and west of the fort were the subject of a five-year project which was now entering its penultimate summer.\n\nOne of the most important finds was the remains of a bathhouse on the east side, which was first alluded to by a dig in 1931 and further explored during the current project.\n\nMr Wilmott said it was a large and obviously important building but it was only last summer when its purpose as a bathhouse was revealed when evidence of the under-floor heating and associated waterworks were discovered.\n\nEvidence of towns and settlements have been found on multiple sides of Birdoswald fort\n\nBut the remains will be covered over again at the end of the summer with Mr Wilmott saying visitors had four weeks to go and see it.\n\n\"We cannot preserve them in situ,\" he said, adding it would cost millions of pounds so covering them over was their best hope for conservation.\n\nOne of this summer's focuses will be a 60m (197ft) by 10m (33ft) field to the west of the fort and Mr Wilmott said he was excited about what could be unearthed.\n\n\"We are following up on a survey which seems to show an open area with buildings around it that looks like a marketplace,\" he said.\n\nMr Wilmott said he had been working at Birdoswald since 1987 with some 21% of the fort having been examined.\n\nMultiple Roman artefacts have been found including this face painted on a pot, possibly that of Empress Julia Domna who died in 217\n\n\"It's a dream to work here,\" he said, adding the archaeology students from Newcastle University assisting with the dig also appreciated the site's importance and the opportunity it offered to learn more.\n\nSince the project began, more than 200 students have taken part and discoveries have included large amounts of domestic pottery, hobnails used to protect the soles of footwear, semi-precious jasper and glass stones used in rings and to seal documents.\n\nIan Haynes, Newcastle University Professor of Archaeology, said the dig would be a \"career highlight\" for students and staff, adding: \"Birdoswald always has something surprising to teach us.\"\n\nVisitors can take a guided tour of the dig and meet some of the archaeologists until 7 July.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

This feels really prudish and horrible.\"\n\nMs Farley said Ms Pantle raised the issue at a club meeting, but shortly afterwards she received a letter stating she had breached the no nudity rule, and would be disciplined and asked to leave if she did it again.\n\nMs Pantle instead chose to resign and walk away, Ms Farley said.\n\n\"Nada and I care a lot about child protection but we don't believe this is a constructive solution. I would happily pay higher yearly fees if this is a funding issue,\" she added.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC, Ms Pantle said: \"They didn't say what I did or who had made a complaint, but it sort of implied I'd done something almost sexual.\n\n\"At some point, you've got to take your clothes off to get your other clothes on. That's why we have change rooms.\"\n\nSurf Life Saving New South Wales CEO Steve Pearce said the signage \"probably could have been done better\", but was only done as an interim measure until the changing rooms are renovated.\n\n\"We're aware the facilities are inadequate,\" he told the BBC. \"But [the club] received complaints from some junior members about being intimidated and uncomfortable.\n\nMr Pearce said over a third of the Terrigal club's registered members were aged under 14.\n\n\"Instead of just putting a blanket 'no nudity', if the signs explained why people should refrain from being nude while children were in the change room, it would have been better received, and we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n\"We will be suggesting a better form of signage, but the whole thing was done with the best intent to ensure the psychological well being of the members.

faced physical, sexual, emotional or spiritual abuse by someone representing the Church.\n\nBut some fear being re-traumatised by the application process.\n\nIn 2020, Church of England leaders made a commitment to settle compensation claims quickly where abuse had been acknowledged.\n\nIt now says a robust scheme will take some time to be established and the parameters are still being discussed.\n\nThe scheme will be administered by a still-to-be-determined third party.\n\nThe Church promises survivors who have never before come forward will be eligible.\n\n\"We want to take a broad and a generous approach to this and not a begrudging one that would sit ill with our commitment to provide genuine redress, to express genuine regret and repentance for what's happened,\" the Right Reverend Philip Mounstephen, Bishop of Truro, told the BBC.\n\nBut the bishop, chair of the Church of England's national redress board, acknowledged there was little idea of how many people

its commissioners' board has agreed to set aside \u00a3150m in initial funding once the scheme is in place to ensure swift financial payouts.\n\nThe BBC understands that the eligibility of applicants

I did not commit the crime, but I was treated as if I did. I spent 17 years on my guard against every threat.\n\n\"Seventeen years counting down the minutes to lock up, so I could be behind my door and safe from other prisoners, but not safe from my own mind, imagining I would die there, perhaps murdered.\n\nHis mother Trisha Hose said: \"For nearly 20 years people have assumed that I was just a loyal but deluded mother in denial about what my son was capable of doing.\n\n\"I knew the system had got it wrong, but it seemed like there was nothing I could do about it.\"\n\nNow he had been cleared, Ms Hose said she was \"no longer a deluded mother\" and her son was \"no longer a monster\".\n\n\"But what has been done to him cannot be undone,\" she said.\n\n\"The damage will be with him for the rest of his life, and the woman who got attacked has been denied justice, just as my son was.\"\n\nMr Malkinson was convicted of carrying out the rape in Salford in 2003\n\nOpening the appeal earlier, Mr Henry said: \"This is the most troubling case which may have wide implications for the administration of criminal justice.\n\n\"This is a historic case - and a historic injustice.\n\n\"Grave failures that must lie at the door of GMP that wholly undermined a fair trial.\"\n\n\"No-one else should have to go through what Mr Malkinson has endured.\"\n\nLord Justice Holroyde said other points argued by Mr Malkinson's legal team, about \"crucial\" material that was not disclosed at the time of his trial, \"raised a number of substantial and important points\".\n\nHe said the court would take time to consider them and give a decision on them later in writing.\n\nGreater Manchester Police has apologised for a \"grave miscarriage of justice\"\n\nGMP's Assistant Chief Constable Sarah Jackson said the force was \"truly sorry\" to Mr Malkinson over the \"grave miscarriage of justice\".\n\nShe said the force was \"also profoundly sorry to the victim of this crime, who not only suffered an horrific trauma 20 years ago, but also relived the experience during a criminal trial, and now may endure additional harm caused by learning that the true offender has not yet been brought to justice\".\n\nCases like Mr Malkinson's were \"thankfully very rare\", she said, but added that the force had and would continue to \"fully co-operate with any further reviews and action will be taken if it is found that anything could have been done differently\".\n\nShe said she had offered to meet Mr Malkinson \"to personally deliver this apology\".\n\n\"We are determined to work with our colleagues in the CPS to ensure all new evidence is fully examined and that the person truly responsible is convicted,\" she said.\n\nCCRC chairman Helen Pitcher said she welcomed the decision to overturn Mr Malkinson's conviction.\n\n\"In the ever-changing world of forensic science, new evidence can come to light years after a conviction,\" she said.\n\n\"We used our special powers to take advantage of DNA breakthroughs to find evidence that we considered could overturn this conviction.\n\n\"We recognise that Andrew has had a very long journey to clear his name, but sadly the evidence that led to the court overturning his conviction only became available years after his conviction.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Debate began around 22.15 BST, and votes could continue into the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nBut if they back down, it will pave the way for the legislation to become law before MPs begin their summer recess later this week.\n\nThe bill, backed by MPs in March, is central to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's high-profile pledge to \"stop\" small boats crossing the English Channel.\n\nIt would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.\n\nThe Rwanda plan was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last month, but ministers are challenging the judgement.\n\nMPs have been locked in a battle over the final shape of the bill with the House of Lords, where it has been repeatedly amended by opposition peers.\n\nThey voted down nine amendments made by the Lords last week, including one which would have placed a three-day limit on the time unaccompanied child migrants can be detained before they are deported.\n\nThey also overturned a suggested four-day detention limit suggested for accompanied children, and a ban on LGBT migrants from being deported to Rwanda and nine other, mainly African countries.\n\nMPs also voted down an amendment that would have forced the government to create new safe and legal asylum routes within nine months of the bill passing. Ministers have promised to do this by the end of 2024.\n\nSpeaking before the votes, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said the Lords amendments would have created \"exemptions, qualifications and loopholes\" that would make the legislation harder to implement.\n\nHe said the power to detain people who are due to be deported was necessary to stop people absconding, and exempting families with children would leave a \"gaping hole\" in the system.\n\nTim Loughton, one of 11 Tory MPs to rebel over child detention limits, said government promises that detention would be for the shortest period possible should be written into the legislation.\n\nShadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the bill was \"unworkable\" and an exercise in \"performative cruelty\".\n\nHe added that Rwanda would only be able to take a tiny fraction of the migrants arriving in small boats, meaning the threat of being deported there would not deter people from making the journey.", "Bader lost part of his right leg after being hit by a shell on his way home from school\n\nIf suffering had an address, it might be al-Rasheed Street, in Taiz, a Yemeni city ringed by mountains and rebel Houthi fighters. On this narrow street of rough-hewn homes, the young can't escape a grinding conflict the world tends to forget.\n\nA slight boy with a mop of dark hair leads us down the street, nimbly side-stepping potholes - with his crutches. Bader al-Harbi is seven years old, just a little younger than Yemen's war. His right leg has been amputated above the knee. The slogan on his T-shirt reads \"Sport\".\n\nIn the back yard of his family home, Bader sits on some breeze blocks, his stump exposed. His remaining foot has no shoe. His big brother Hashim is by his side, sharing his trauma and his silence.\n\nHashim's right foot has been mangled and he is missing a thumb. He fidgets endlessly with his hands as if trying to rub out the scars.\n\nThe boys were hit by Houthi shelling on an October morning last year as they came home from school on a break, according to their father, al-Harbi Nasser al-Majnahi. They have not been back to their classes since.\n\n\"Everything changed completely,\" he says, sitting cross-legged on a mattress. \"They no longer play outside with other kids. They are disabled. They are scared and have psychological problems.\"\n\nIn a small voice, sounding younger than his nine years, Hashim says he would like to go back to school.\n\n\"I want to study and learn,\" he tells me. I asked Bader if he wants to go too. \"Yes,\" he replies. \"But my leg has been cut off, so how can I go?\"\n\nTheir father says they have not been enrolled for the upcoming school year because he has no money for transport. And he has no way to get his family out of harm's way.\n\n\"Even though we are scared, we can't afford to live anywhere else,\" he tells me, \"because the rent would be higher. So, we are forced to stay here, whether we live or die.\"\n\nWhat began as a civil war has been fuelled by regional rivals backing opposing sides. Sunni Saudi Arabia supports Yemen's internationally-recognised government, weak as it is. Shia Iran backs the Houthi movement, formally known as Ansar Allah (or Supporters of God).\n\nNine years after the conflict began, Taiz bears the scars\n\nIn September 2014, the Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, driving out the government. The following spring a Saudi-led coalition intervened, backed by the UK and the US.\n\nThe Saudis promised a quick operation to restore the government to power. Not quite.\n\nEight years, and thousands of coalition air strikes later, the Houthis still hold the capital. The Saudis now want a quick exit - militarily at least.\n\nAnd on the front lines in Taiz, Bader and Hashim still sleep and wake to the sound of warfare.\n\n\"I hear explosions,\" says Bader, \"and there are snipers. They shoot everything in the neighbourhood. I feel like there could be an explosion near me, or the house could be blown up.\"\n\nWe walk a few steps to the house next door - where another childhood has been ripped asunder.\n\nAmir appears on the doorstep - a three-year old in a yellow T-shirt, silent and sombre. In place of his right leg there is a metal prosthetic. His father, Sharif al-Amri, helps him to stand, bending often to kiss his forehead.\n\nAmir \"remembers every moment\" after the shelling that took his leg, his father says\n\nAmir was maimed on the same day as Bader and Hashim - just a few hours later.\n\nHe was in a relative's house across the road when it was shelled, killing both his uncle and his six-year-old cousin. Amir survived but has penetrating wounds of memory.\n\nAs Sharif puts his son's pain into words, Amir nods off in the stifling heat, cradled in his arms.\n\n\"He remembers every moment after the shelling happened until he arrived at hospital. He says, 'This happened to my uncle, and this happened to my cousin.' He talks about the smoke and the blood that he saw. When he sees children playing, he gets very upset and says, 'I don't have a leg.'\"\n\nEvery house on this street has its measure of fear. Munir's has more than most. The father of four leads me down an alleyway to his family home, which is right in the line of fire. Houthi gunmen are as near as his neighbours - he says about 20-30m away.\n\n\"There's a sniper is front of us,\" says Munir, crouching down by his living room window. \"I can see him now if I open the window. If you go outside to the garden, he will shoot.\n\n\"We live in fear here in Taiz. People don't know when they will be hit by a missile or a sniper. God willing there will be peace and Yemen will go back to being great.\"\n\nIn the hallway we meet his eldest son Mohammed, an animated 14-year-old who relies on a wheelchair. When his school was shelled the other pupils ran away, leaving him behind. Now he worries that, if his house is hit, his family could be hurt trying to rescue him.\n\nFor more than 3,000 days Taiz has been virtually besieged, a battleground between government and Houthi forces. And the young have not been spared.\n\nA local doctor told us that since 2015, he has treated about 100 child amputees - maimed by Houthi shelling, mines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nMost of children maimed and killed in Taiz over the years have been victims of the Houthis. Others died in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition - in the early war years - and some were killed by government forces. All sides have blood on their hands.\n\nYemen's conflict is now on a lower flame - since a UN-brokered truce last year that held for six months. It's no longer all-out war, but it's not peace either.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have shaken hands and made up. So far, so good. There have been talks between the Saudis and the Houthis, but sources tell us they have stalled. And there are no talks involving Yemen's own warring factions.\n\nThe country is increasingly fragmented, like a broken jigsaw that can't be reassembled. A separatist movement - backed by the United Arab Emirates - wants the south to be independent, as it was from 1967 until 1990. That is one more fissure in a fraying state.\n\nI've been coming to Yemen since the war escalated in March 2015. This is my seventh visit. While the international community talks of peace moves, on the ground there is weariness and despair.\n\nDuring three weeks on the ground in the south, many conversations felt like a farewell, a requiem to the nation.\n\nMany doubt that Yemen will survive in its current form. Many more doubt that the Houthis will make peace.\n\n\"They claim they have a divine right to rule,\" said a twenty-something professional in Taiz, who preferred not to be named. \"They claim the Prophet is their grandfather. I can't see them giving up their guns and going back to democracy and elections.\"\n\nOr put another way by Gamal Mahmoud Al Masrahi, who is in charge of camps for the displaced in south-west Yemen, \"the international community is living an illusion\" when it thinks the Houthis will make peace.\n\nWe wanted to take the temperature in the Houthi-controlled north, home to most of Yemen's population of 32 million. But after we arrived in the country, the Houthis revoked our permission. Human rights campaigners in Sanaa say the de facto rulers are increasingly repressive.\n\nAs we leave al-Rasheed Street, Bader has come outside, but he's sitting alone by the side of road. Amir is being wheeled along on the crossbar of a bicycle by his father. \"Don't be scared, my love,\" Sharif says, \"I am beside you.\"\n\nHe asks his son what he wants in the future.\n\n\"Buy me a gun,\" Amir replies haltingly, his words jarring with his babyish voice.\n\n\"I will load a bullet in my gun and fire at those who took my leg.\"\n\nIt was a three-hour journey on the back of a motorbike, across rough terrain - part road, part stones - in relentless heat. But this was the only way for Rajah Mohammed to get his desperately ill son, Awam, to a specialist children's hospital in Taiz.\n\nFirst, he had to spend 10 days earning the money to pay for the trip from their home in the Red Sea port of Mocha. The journey cost 20,000 Yemeni rials, the equivalent of $14 (\u00a310.73).\n\nWhen Awam arrived at the Yemeni Swedish hospital - still so-called, though its Swedish benefactors are long gone - staff rushed to weigh and measure him. But the charts and scales were not needed to confirm he was severely malnourished. His wizened arms and painfully distended stomach told the story.\n\nRajah - who has four more children - has been battling to save his son for a year.\n\nRajah Mohammed travelled three hours by motorbike to take his son to hospital\n\n\"He always has a fever,\" he tells me, standing at Awam's bedside, fanning him with a piece of cardboard.\n\n\"We have been to all the hospitals in Mocha. We were told to bring him here. I can barely afford to feed my children. Sometimes all we have is bread and tea. It can be like that for a month or more.\"\n\nHunger is part of the bedrock of Yemen, but it has been compounded by the conflict which has destroyed livelihoods, driven up prices, displaced more than four million people and closed half the health facilities in the country.\n\nRajah is one of those made homeless by the war. \"We have been displaced six or seven times,\" he says. \"Every time we must move to a new place because we are scared of landmines.\"\n\nHunger has been stalking his child - and many others here - from birth. Nearly 500,000 Yemeni children under the age of five suffer from severe acute malnutrition and are struggling to survive, according to the United Nations (UN).\n\nFor Awam, there is one more threat. Tests show he may have leukaemia and could require lengthy treatment.\n\nFor Rajah, keeping one son in hospital means risking his other children going hungry at home. He takes Awam back to Mocha the following day. He tells doctors he will try to earn more money to bring him back.\n\nDoctors say they are receiving many patients from the city - once famed for its coffee trade, now flooded with displaced families.\n\nWe travel there along the same bumpy road that Rajah took with his son, but in the comfort of a four-wheel-drive car.\n\nWe arrive at a rural health clinic, teeming with mothers clad head-to-toe in black abayas and face veils, holding up sick children. The air is heavy with the mothers' pleas and the babies' cries.\n\nThe three-room clinic is mostly closed these days but local officials decide to open it because we were in the area. The mothers surge forward, thinking we are foreign doctors, begging us to help their children.\n\nA local doctor appears but he tells us staff at the clinic are on strike and will not be treating any cases. \"We cannot do anything for them,\" says Dr Ali bin ali Doberah.\n\n\"We have not been paid for four months. Some of us are going to look for jobs that pay because we cannot feed our children.\"\n\nThe clinic is no longer getting support from foreign aid agencies who used to pay some of the salaries. Nine health centres have closed in Mocha and other areas of Yemen's west coast, because of lack of funding.\n\nAcross the country, aid agencies are scaling back. The UN World Food Programme has already made deep cuts, north and south. It says it will have to stop food supplies for between three and five million people by mid-September unless more money comes in.\n\nIn the middle of the throng there is an 11-month-old called Safaa - whose arms and legs are just skin and bone and whose face is contorted in pain. This fisherman's daughter is wasting away. She also suffers from a liver complaint.\n\n\"Sometimes she does not have food while her dad is at sea. We must wait for him to come back so we can buy her food,\" says her mother, Umm Ahmed.\n\n\"I am worried about her. I want to get help for her, but our circumstances are difficult.\"\n\nUmm Ahmed's head is bent low, her shoulder slumped. Her family history is like a summary of Yemen's war years, written in blood and suffering.\n\nShe tells us she has been displaced for seven years, her brother-in-law was killed in an air strike, and her niece was blown up by a landmine. She has buried four of her nine children, because of malnutrition and liver problems. Now hunger is menacing her baby girl.\n\nUmm Ahmed leads us the short distance to her home, which - like her country - has seen better days. The bright blue paint is fading from the walls. There is an ornate wooden door but little furniture and no toys. She puts Safaa in a hammock made from a shawl, swinging her back and forth to keep her cool.\n\nHer husband, Anwar Taleb, looks worried and weary. He's a third-generation fisherman with a bushy beard, who can barely feed his family.\n\nSafaa's parents cannot afford the five-hour journey to the hospital offering specialist treatment\n\n\"I go to sea for 15-20 days at a time and get what I can get,\" he says, \"but for the past three months I have not found any work. Sometimes the money we make only covers the cost of the trip.\"\n\nHe tells us he has married off his two daughters - aged 14 and 15 - because he can't afford to feed them. We ask to meet them, but he says that even if he agrees, their husbands will not. Two more childhoods cut short. Two more hidden victims of war.\n\nNow Safaa may be running out of time.\n\nWe give her parents a lift to a better-equipped local clinic - this one is functioning. She is admitted immediately, but doctors say she will need specialist treatment in the southern port city of Aden - a journey of about five hours that her parents cannot afford.\n\nAfter a few days we learn that she too has been taken back home, where there may be little to feed her.\n\nWar, hunger, and poverty are intertwined here. Yemen's children may escape one and fall victim to the others.\n\nAnd they are at risk of international neglect. The horrors of Ukraine are closer to home for many Western nations than distant suffering in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nNow more than ever Yemenis fear they are easy to overlook.\n\nWho will help the wounded boys of Taiz - Bader, Hashim and Amir - and the starving infants of Mocha - Awam and Safaa?\n\nIf you'd like more information on the background to this story, the BBC World Service programme The Explanation has been speaking to Nawal Al-Maghafi - a BBC correspondent who has been reporting on the Middle East since 2012.\n\nShe explained how the complex war began between government-backed forces and Houthi rebels, and how it led to Yemen's current humanitarian crisis.\n\nListen here: How Yemen has been engulfed by civil war", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

I believe we fight for nothing.\"\n\nIn southern Italy, fires in Sicily and Puglia have also been fuelled by high winds and tinder-dry vegetation, meaning firefighters have been struggling in many areas to douse the flames and create firebreaks.\n\nThe church of St Benedict the Moor in the Sicilian city of Palermo was among the buildings that have been destroyed in the fires.\n\n\"The damage is enormous,\" said Vincenzo Bruccoleri, superior friar of the convent.\n\nEnrico Trantino, the mayor of Catania, another city on the island, told the BBC the high temperatures had melted underground electrical cables, which had left parts of the city without power and water.\n\nHowever, Italy is expected to become much cooler in the coming days, according to BBC Weather.\n\nThe heaviest death toll so far is in Algeria, with more than 30 victims, including 10 soldiers surrounded by flames during an evacuation in the coastal province of Bejaia, east of Algiers.\n\nMost of the fires have now been contained.\n\nIn neighbouring Tunisia, the country's Interior Minister, Kamel Feki, said on Wednesday that all of the wildfires were under control and there had been no loss of life.\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said support was being sent to affected countries, including Tunisia and Greece.\n\nBut Yamina Saheb, lead author on the United Nations' climate change panel, known as the IPCC, told the BBC that people in the African region felt they were being left to fend for themselves without international help.\n\n\"People are scared and they don't really understand why there is no international help,\" she said.\n\nMs Saheb said she had spoken to friends and colleagues in the affected areas, who were finding it hard to understand why there was no European aid when they were so close to the continent.\n\n\"They say, if the situation gets worse, what are we going to do? Are we going to die, all of us? Is Africa going to die because of climate change, and Europe will be watching that, just watching and not doing anything?\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Residents in Algeria return to areas blackened by wildfires\n\nThe EU has also said it wants to sign contracts for up to 12 firefighting planes in order to improve its ability to fight blazes fuelled by climate change. These would be the first it would fully own.\n\nA team of climate scientists - the World Weather Attribution group - said this month's intense heatwave in Southern Europe, North America and China would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change.\n\nThe fires have dealt a blow to the summer tourism industry, especially in Greece, where the industry accounts for one in five jobs and is vital for Rhodes and many other islands.\n\nHoliday firms Jet2 and Tui have cancelled departures to the island for the coming days.\n\nTui said that it had already brought hundreds of people home, while hundreds more were expected to make it back to the UK on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office has not advised against travel to the affected parts of Greece, but has urged tourists to check with tour operators for updates.\n\nThousands of people have also been evacuated on Evia and Corfu, while Crete - another major holiday destination - is on high alert.\n\nOther European countries have not escaped the heatwave unscathed.

They spent \u00a31.25m on the pitch and it's been playable all week.\n\n\"When you invest that money, it comes out of my player budget. Clubs are able to pay more than us because they don't invest money in their infrastructure or pitch. We can see that that's the case here.\"\n\nIn a statement earlier, Motherwell also thanked their fans for the \"dedication and understanding\" they have shown.\n\nDundee, meanwhile, thanked \"club staff, contractors and wonderful volunteers who all played their part\" in assisting.\n\nPeterhead's trip to Bonnyrigg Rose and Elgin City v Spartans in the fourth tier both go ahead after passing pitch inspections, as does Stirling Albion's League 1 encounter with Alloa Athletic.", "Scottish Greens minister Lorna Slater's charter of a private boat for an official island visit cost \u00a31,200.\n\nA Scottish Conservatives freedom of information request revealed the cost, which was covered by government agency NatureScot.\n\nMs Slater visited the Isle of Rum, off the west coast, for five hours on 12 May. A return ferry ticket costs \u00a39.40.\n\nShe was criticised at the time for using a private hire instead of a government-owned CalMac service.\n\nThe ministerial visit was arranged to discuss the future of the island and Kinloch Castle.\n\nCity financier and former Tory donor Jeremy Hosking had said he was interested in buying the castle, but blamed Ms Slater's intervention when he withdrew his bid.\n\nRum, the largest of the Small Isles in the inner Hebrides, is mostly owned by Nature Scot and has a population of about 40 in its off-grid community 30 miles from the mainland.\n\nThe Scottish government said at the time that hiring a boat, instead of taking a ferry, allowed the minister to spend more time on the island.\n\nEight passengers - Ms Slater, three NatureScot staff, two government staff and two islanders - travelled on the 42-berth MV Larven, leaving Mallaig before 09:00.\n\nThe Scottish government said they returned to the mainland later that afternoon, having spent five hours on Rum.\n\nThe catamaran is owned by Western Isles Cruises Ltd but has also been chartered by Calmac to cover Small Island routes between Mallaig and the small isles since 2019.\n\nCalMac runs a return service between Rum and Mallaig on three weekdays and at weekends during the summer season, costing \u00a39.40 per passenger.\n\nThe cost for Ms Slater and her party would have been \u00a375.20 had they been able to use the ferry.\n\nMs Slater was due to discuss the future of Kinloch Castle which was built in the 1890s as a hunting lodge\n\nOn Fridays the MV Lochnevis leaves Mallaig at 12:45, arriving at 14:10. That gives three hours and 10 minutes on the island before the return crossing departs at 17:20.\n\nA longer day trip is possible on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. On Saturdays the ferry timetable allows a stop on the island of seven hours and 25 minutes.\n\nNatureScot said it uses private boats if required to access the island.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \"As owners of most the island, we use charters as circumstances demand.\"\n\nShe added: \"As we move forward to try and find a solution to the complicated issues around Kinloch Castle, it was important to ensure [Ms Slater] had as much time as possible on the island and we appreciated the minister fitting the visit into her busy schedule.\"\n\nSteve Robertson from the island's community trust previously described the row as \"a storm in a teacup\" but confirmed that the CalMac ferry service did not meet the island's needs.\n\nRum Community Trust's Steve Robertson said charter boats were needed to make the island sustainable\n\nOn Friday he told BBC Scotland the key story for islanders was that Ms Slater \"came to see us, to hear us\" and she took a \"normal method of transport\" that is also used for doctors, tradesmen and to transport children to school each week.\n\n\"We have to use charters to make things work,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the Scottish Conservatives accused the minister of having \"no shame\".\n\nTheir transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: \"This revelation is a further kick in the teeth to Scotland's betrayed island communities - as well as taxpayers footing the enormous bill for the SNP-Greens' ferries scandal.\"\n\nHe added: \"The government she's a member of has created mayhem on Scotland's ferry network through their incompetence, and yet she thought it appropriate to shun a CalMac ferry at less than a tenner a head return to shell out \u00a31,200 of public money on a chartered boat to take her and her team to Rum.\n\n\"It's utterly tone deaf to the plight of islanders, who have to make do with a pitiful ferry service. It's also the height of hypocrisy from a Green minister who's forever demanding a greater use of public transport.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said Ms Slater's visit was \"warmly welcomed by the community\" and was an opportunity to discuss its \"vision for the future of the island and Kinloch Castle\".\n\nThe former Edwardian pleasure palace is at risk of deteriorating as it is no longer being used as a hostel.\n\n\"The minister's visit on 12 May was well received by residents and community groups,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"The crossing to Rum was arranged by NatureScot, with the agreement of the Scottish government, to maximise time on the island speaking to residents and fit with Ms Slater's ministerial schedule.\"", "Two more days of strike action will take place on 27 April and 2 May in England and on 26 April in Northern Ireland\n\nA school leaders' union in England will ballot its members over strike action for the first time.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said the ballot will be over the school funding crisis, pay and conditions, and staff shortages.\n\nMembers will be asked to vote during the summer term and any action taken would be in the autumn term.\n\nGeoff Barton, ASCL's general secretary said the action was taken \"as a last resort and with a heavy heart\".\n\nHe said the move reflected the \"desperate situation regarding inadequate funding, long-term pay erosion, teacher shortages, and the intransigence of a government which we can only conclude does not value the education workforce or recognise the severe pressures facing the sector\".\n\nThe ASCL, which represents mostly head teachers and leaders, has more than 23,000 members.\n\nThe union, along with three other teaching unions involved in the dispute, has rejected an improved government pay offer.\n\nA total of 56% of ASCL members voted on the offer, with 87% of those rejecting it.\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said it had made a \"fair and reasonable\" pay offer recognising \"teachers' hard work and commitment\".\n\nIt included a \u00a31,000 one-off payment this year and a 4.3% pay rise for most staff next year. The starting salary for teachers in England is also due to rise to \u00a330,000 a year by September 2023.\n\nThe government said it believes schools can afford to fund most of the pay rise through money already promised in the Autumn Statement, but that it would have provided some additional money to fund the remainder of it, and for the \u00a31,000 one-off payment.\n\nMost state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise in 2022.\n\nUnions want negotiations to continue, but the decision will now be made by the pay review body.\n\nThere are further strikes planned in England and Northern Ireland.\n\nMembers of the National Education Union in England are striking on Thursday 27 April and Tuesday 2 May and in Northern Ireland, five unions will also strike on Wednesday 26 April.\n\nThe National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is also considering balloting members again over strike action.\n\nA DfE official said school funding would be at its highest level in history next year.\n\n\"We know schools are facing increased costs like energy and staffing and [we] are providing an extra \u00a32bn in each of the next two years to cover those costs,\" the official said.\n\n\"As a result, school funding is set to rise faster than forecast inflation in both 2023-24 and 2024-25.\"\n\u2022 None Teachers' strike this week: Is my school affected?", "\"Ignorant\" animal rights protesters are to blame for the death of Hill Sixteen during Saturday's Grand National at Aintree, says the horse's trainer.\n\nThe start of the race was delayed by 14 minutes after activists looking to stop it taking place entered the track.\n\nTrainer Sandy Thomson said the delay \"unsettled\" everyone.\n\n\"It was all caused by these so-called animal lovers who are actually ignorant and have absolutely no idea about the welfare of horses,\" Thomson said.\n\nHill Sixteen died after falling at the first of 30 fences that make up the steeplechase race of just over four miles. It was the third horse fatality at the three-day meeting.\n\nPolice said they arrested 118 people over Saturday's disruption, which saw nine people enter the course.\n\u2022 None What happened in the Grand National and the fallout from it\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Thomson added: \"There were quite a lot of the horses buzzed up.\"\n\nWhen asked if he had considered withdrawing Hill Sixteen from the race at that point, the Scottish trainer explained: \"When they got down to the start, nobody quite knew what was happening.\n\n\"The starter wanted to get them off as quickly as possible, then the horses were drawn forward then told to get back.\n\n\"One of the other things missing was the parade. I think that gives the horses and the jockeys that couple of minutes to gather their thoughts and that didn't help the situation either.\"\n\nClimate and animal rights group Animal Rising, who demonstrated outside Aintree, claimed on social media their actions \"aimed to prevent\" the death of horses.\n\n\"The real reason the horse was running the race was so that people could bet on the horse, the jockeys could make money and so people could have a fun day out, and that doesn't seem like a good enough reason to put an animal in harm's way,\" Ben Newman, a spokesperson for Animal Rising told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We disrupted the race for two reasons. One was to stop the race to stop a horse dying. Two, to have a conversation about our broken relationship back to animals.\"\n\nThe British Horseracing Authority \"robustly condemned\" the protests, adding it would analyse the races to understand what caused three horse fatalities at the meet.\n\nBHA chief executive Julie Harrington told BBC Sport a \"direct parallel\" between the interruption and the horse's death could not be drawn, but added: \"I will say it certainly cannot have helped\".\n\n\"Whilst the horses are running, if they're disturbed in any way, it is a really dangerous thing, so we would condemn that action.\"\n\nFootage appeared to show some protesters making it on to the track and trying to attach themselves to a fence, before being removed by police.\n\nDozens of others attempted to climb over or glue themselves to security fencing around the track but were led away, with police also confiscating ladders.\n\nAfter the delay was announced on the racecourse public address system, the 39 participating horses were taken back to the pre-parade ring.\n\nThe jockeys were asked to re-mount their rides six minutes after the scheduled start time, with the race starting eight minutes later.\n\nThomson added that Hill Sixteen was \"quite used to the fences\" at Aintree having previously finished second in the 2021 Becher Chase and seventh in this season's version of the same race.\n\nAs well as the death of Hill Sixteen, Dark Raven was put down earlier on Saturday following a fall during the Turners Mersey Novices' Hurdle, while Envoye Special suffered a fatal injury in the Foxhunters' Chase on Thursday.\n\nThere have been five fatalities from 395 runners in the 10 Grand Nationals raced since safety changes were introduced in 2012.\n\n\"Nobody wants that to happen to their horse but that is what they are bred to do, what they love doing. They wouldn't jump these fences if they didn't want to,\" Thomson said.\n\nTwo other horses in the Grand National - Recite A Prayer and Cape Gentleman - were treated on course and taken away by horse ambulance for further assessment.\n\nTrainer Willie Mullins told Racing TV that Recite A Prayer will be fine following a \"little procedure\" on a fractured eye socket sustained when running loose after jockey Jack Foley was knocked off.\n\nTrainer John 'Shark' Hanlon said Cape Gentleman had surgery on Sunday for a severed tendon and will head to the United States to spend his retirement with owner Pierre Manigault.\n\nThomson said the number of horses falling in the race \"point to the fact\" they were unsettled by the delay.\n\n\"If we look at the last nine years since the course has been modified there's been an average of under two fallers at the first two fences,\" he said.\n\n\"This year everyone got very uptight about it - horses, jockeys - and there were eight fallers at those first two fences.\n\n\"We as a sport are continually moving forward, we're continually trying to make the sport safer.\"\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) has called for reform into the size of the field that races in the Grand National.\n\nSeventeen of the 39 runners completed the course on Saturday.\n\n\"One of the things we see part at the Grand National is a big field so lots of horses running together so that causes issues when horses fall and can get in the way of other horses and cause accidents in that way,\" said Emma Slawinski, director of policy, prevention and campaigns at the RSPCA.\n\nIn 2012 changes were made to the Aintree course following a safety review.\n\nThis included moving the start 90 yards closer to the first fence to help slow the speed the horses arrive at it. The start has also been moved further away from the crowd to reduce noise that can distract the horses.\n\nSome of the fences were also redesigned, with a reduction of between four and five inches to the drop on the landing of Becher's Brook among the changes.\n\nChanges to the fences' core material were also introduced, with a plastic centre replacing the wooden stakes which traditionally supported the structure of the fences to make them more flexible and less likely to cause dangerous falls when hit by horses.\n\n\"The BHA and the Jockey Club are continually in contact with the RSPCA and World Horse Welfare,\" Thomson said.\n\n\"If you look back 20 years ago and you look at the fences there has been huge modification.\n\n\"Two of the considerations are there could be a shorter run to the first fence and a few less horses. Those are obvious things that may be considered.\"\n\nThe RSPCA also wants \"very urgent\" reform on the use of the whip in horse racing as a method to encourage horses to run faster.\n\n\"We know that actually causes more accidents and makes accidents more likely, injuries more likely so we would like to see that reform happen as well,\" Slawinski told the Today programme.\n\nEarlier this year, changes were made to rules on the use of whips in British racing which reduced the number of times the whip is permitted by one - to seven in jumps races and six in flat races, with jockeys facing suspension for going above that limit and their horse being disqualified if they go four or more over the threshold.", "The US has supplied Israel's air force with F-35s, the most advanced fighter jets ever made\n\nWestern governments are coming under growing pressure to halt arms sales to Israel over how it is waging the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael is a major weapons exporter, but its military has been heavily reliant on imported aircraft, guided bombs and missiles to conduct what experts have described as one of the most intense and destructive aerial campaigns in recent history.\n\nCampaign groups and some politicians among Israel's Western allies say arms exports should be suspended because, they say, Israel is failing to do enough to protect the lives of civilians and ensure enough humanitarian aid reaches them.\n\nOn Friday, the UN Human Rights Council backed a weapons ban, with 28 countries voting in favour, six against and 13 abstentions. The US and Germany - which account for the vast majority of Israel's arms imports - both voted against. Germany said it did so because the resolution did not explicitly condemn Hamas.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, according Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 people have been killed in Gaza, 70% of them children and women, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\n\nIsrael insists that its forces are working to avoid civilian casualties, accuses Hamas of deliberately putting civilians in the line of fire and has said there are no limits on aid deliveries.\n\nThe US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, having helped it build one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries in the world.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounted for 69% of Israel's arms imports between 2019 and 2023.\n\nThe US provides Israel with $3.8bn (\u00a33bn) in annual military aid under a 10-year agreement that is intended to allow its ally to maintain what it calls a \"qualitative military edge\" over neighbouring countries.\n\nIsrael has used the grants to finance orders of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, a stealth aircraft considered the most advanced ever made. It has so far ordered 75 and taken delivery of more than 30 of the aircraft. It was the first country other than the US to receive an F-35 and the first to use one in combat.\n\nPart of the aid - $500m annually - is set aside to fund missile defence programmes, including the jointly developed Iron Dome, Arrow and David's Sling systems. Israel has relied on them during the war to defend itself against rocket, missile and drone attacks by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, as well as other Iran-backed armed groups based in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the days after Hamas's 7 October attack, President Joe Biden said the US was \"surging additional military assistance\" to Israel.\n\nSince the start of the war, only two US military sales to Israel have been made public after receiving emergency approval - one for 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth $106m and the other for $147m of components to make 155mm artillery shells.\n\nBut US media report that President Joe Biden's administration has also quietly made more than 100 military sales to Israel, most falling below the dollar amount that would require Congress to be formally notified. They are said to include thousands of precision-guided munitions, small-diameter bombs, bunker busters and small arms.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome batteries help protect cities and towns from rocket and missile fire\n\nHowever, SIPRI's report says that despite the deliveries, the total volume of Israeli arms imports from the US in 2023 was almost the same as in 2022.\n\nOne deal that is large enough to require Congressional notification is the $18bn sale of up to 50 F-15 fighter jets, news about which emerged this week. Congress has not yet approved the deal.\n\nEven though the aircraft would need to be built from scratch and would not be delivered immediately, the sale is expected to be hotly debated by Mr Biden's Democratic Party, many of whose representatives in Congress and supporters are increasingly concerned by Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has said she is prepared to block the deal and has accused Israel of \"indiscriminate bombing\" in Gaza.\n\nGermany is the next biggest arms exporter to Israel, accounting for 30% of imports between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI.\n\nAs of early November, the European nation's weapons sales to Israel last year were worth \u20ac300m ($326m; $257m) - a 10-fold increase compared with 2022 - with the majority of those export licences granted after the 7 October attacks.\n\nComponents for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has been a staunch supporter of Israel's right to self-defence throughout the war and, although his tone on Israeli actions in Gaza has shifted in recent weeks and there has been some debate in Germany, the arms sales do not appear to be at risk of suspension.\n\nIsrael rejects accusations that it is failing to do enough to protect civilians in Gaza and instead blames Hamas\n\nItaly is the third-biggest arms exporter to Israel, but it accounted for only 0.9% of Israeli imports between 2019 and 2023. They have reportedly included helicopters and naval artillery.\n\nThe sales amounted to \u20ac13.7m ($14.8m; \u00a311.7m) last year, according to national statistics bureau ISTAT.\n\nSome \u20ac2.1m of exports were approved between October and December, despite the government's assurances that it was blocking them under a law which bans weapons sales to countries that are waging war or are deemed to be violating human rights.\n\nDefence Minister Guido Crosetto told parliament last month that Italy had honoured existing contracts after checking them on a case-by-case basis and ensuring \"they did not concern materials that could be used against civilians\".\n\nThe UK's arms exports to Israel are \"relatively small\", according to the UK government, amounting to only \u00a342m ($53m) in 2022.\n\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says that since 2008, the UK has granted arms export licences to Israel worth \u00a3574m ($727m) in total.\n\nMuch of those are for components used in US-made warplanes that end up in Israel. But the British government is coming under growing pressure to suspend even those exports.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK has a \"very careful export licensing regime\" and said Israel must \"act in accordance with international humanitarian law\". The UK government is also preparing an assessment that will advise on the risk of Israel breaching international law in its actions from early 2024.\n\nBut a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was \"not going to happen\".\n\nThe government of Canada, whose arms sales to Israel were worth 21.3m Canadian dollars ($15.7m; \u00a312.4m) in 2022, said in January that it had suspended approving new exit permits for weapons until it could ensure they were being used in accordance with Canadian law. However, pre-existing permits remained valid.\n\nIsrael's Elbit Systems developed the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) being used in Gaza\n\nIsrael has also built up its own defence industry with US help and now ranks as the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world, with a focus on advanced technological products rather than large-scale hardware.\n\nIt held a 2.3% share of global sales between 2019 and 2023, according to SIPRI, with India (37%), the Philippines (12%) and the US (8.7%) the three main recipients.

Thanks for joining us.", "Liverpool 2-1 Brighton: Jurgen Klopp says Roberto de Zerbi is 'turning football upside down' Last updated on .From the section Liverpool\n\nDown in the Anfield tunnel, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp shared a warm hug with his Brighton counterpart Roberto de Zerbi in a moment which illustrated the love and respect between the pair. It came shortly after Liverpool had edged past Brighton to go top of the Premier League table, when the managers passed each other again during their round of post-match interviews. \"I told De Zerbi to keep turning the football world upside down,\" Klopp told BBC Radio 5 Live when asked what he had said to the Italian. \"I will watch it from some distance. I respect so much what he's doing.\" But where will the soon-to-depart Liverpool boss, who is taking a break from the game at the end of the season, be watching De Zerbi ply his trade? It remains a possibility that the Brighton manager could be Klopp's replacement at Anfield. The 44-year-old Italian has become hot property after leading the Seagulls to a sixth-place finish last season and bringing European football to the club for the first time. With doubts over his Brighton future continuing, De Zerbi was already among the favourites to take over from Klopp. But his chances have seemingly increased since Xabi Alonso - who was seen as the frontrunner - decided to stay at Bayer Leverkusen. Klopp might not have a say in who his replacement will be, but the great esteem he holds for De Zerbi would not have gone unnoticed by the Liverpool hierarchy. \"It is incredible what he has done,\" added the German. \"Brighton have lost Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo, they have lots of injuries, but he puts a team like that together. An incredible job.\" Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool had not beaten Roberto de Zerbi's Brighton until Sunday's 2-1 win at Anfield Klopp's relief came after his side fought back from behind to secure a 2-1 victory at Anfield which put them top of the Premier League - at least until Manchester City and Arsenal met later on Sunday. After their title rivals played out a goalless draw, Liverpool stayed top on 67 points with nine rounds of games remaining. Arsenal are second on 65 points, City remain third on 64 points. But securing that cushion was hard going for Liverpool against a Brighton side who are well drilled in understanding De Zerbi's demands. Brighton made the perfect start by scoring through Danny Welbeck's thumping strike after 87 seconds, then defended deeply and disciplined while patiently picking the right moments to counter-attack. \"We played the best game against them since we face each other, so I like that even more,\" said Klopp, who earned his first win over De Zerbi in five attempts. Some had billed the game as an Anfield audition for the former Shakhtar Donetsk manager. While his team ended up losing, De Zerbi said they \"played well\" and \"showed their best\" against one of the leading teams in the Premier League. Brighton have not been able to hit the same heights as last season, impacted by the added Europa League games and a host of injuries to key players stretching De Zerbi's squad. Yet they still sit ninth in the Premier League and remain in the hunt for back-to-back European qualification. De Zerbi remains contracted at Brighton until 2026 but has not been shy in expressing his demands to owner Tony Bloom if he is going to stay. \"I am lucky because I have a clear idea and in my life I decide always what I want to do,\" he said. \"I will speak with Tony and the club and we will find a solution together without problems but I know my future and what I want. \"I want to compete and keep my ambition high because my life is football. I want to wake up happy every morning and fight to reach the maximum.\"\n\u2022 None Our coverage of Liverpool is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Liverpool - go straight to all the best content", "Murray Foote said he had issued agreed party responses to the media\n\nAn SNP media chief has resigned in a row over the party's membership numbers - after it denied the figure had dropped by 30,000.\n\nMurray Foote had described press reports about the numbers last month as \"inaccurate\" and \"drivel\".\n\nThe SNP confirmed yesterday that membership had fallen to 72,186 from the 104,000 it had two years ago.\n\nMr Foote said he issued agreed party responses to the media which \"created a serious impediment\" to his role.\n\nSNP leadership candidates Ash Regan and Kate Forbes this week demanded to know how many members were eligible to vote in a row over the integrity of the contest.\n\nThey issued a joint letter to Peter Murrell - the SNP's chief executive and husband of Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nThe party initially refused to reveal the numbers, then confirmed there was a drop of 32,000 since December 2021.\n\nLast month the Sunday Mail - where Mr Foote was formerly editor in chief - reported the SNP had lost 30,000 members, which the party said was \"not just wrong, it's wrong by about 30,000\".\n\nMr Foote tweeted: \"Acting in good faith and as a courtesy to colleagues at party HQ, I issued agreed party responses to media inquiries regarding membership.\n\n\"It has subsequently become apparent there are serious issues with these responses.\n\n\"Consequently, I concluded this created a serous impediment to my role and I resigned my position with the SNP group at Holyrood.\"\n\nThe SNP said Mr Foote had been an outstanding head of press for the Holyrood group, adding: \"He has acted entirely in good faith throughout.\"\n\nIn a statement it said: \"The party was asked a specific question about loss of members as a direct result of the GRR [gender recognition reform] Bill and Indyref2. The answer given was intended to make clear that these two reasons had not been the cause of significant numbers of members leaving.\n\n\"The membership figure is normally produced annually and is not produced in response to individual media queries, including in this instance.\n\n\"In retrospect, however, we should not have relied on an understanding of people's reasons for leaving as the basis of the information given to Murray and, thereafter, the media.\n\n\"A new, modernised membership system is currently being developed for the party.\"\n\nMr Foote became editor of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail newspapers in 2014.\n\nHe was responsible for \"The Vow\" front page which was seen as being highly influential in the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.\n\nIt was written by the Better Together campaign in which they promised more powers for Holyrood.\n\nIn an article written for the first anniversary of the vote, Mr Foote wrote that he and colleagues did not believe Alex Salmond was \"offering true independence\" at the time.\n\nHe was appointed the SNP's media chief in 2019.\n\nScottish Conservative MSP Russell Findlay, a former journalist, defended Mr Foote - saying he had been given false information.\n\n\"He didn't lie. The SNP lied,\" Mr Findlay said. \"The problem is not a press officer. The problem is the rotten SNP leadership who deliberately lied to the press and public.\n\n\"We wish our best to Mr Foote, who was clearly told false information and is the fall guy for the SNP hierarchy.\"\n\nAlex Salmond, former first minister and leader of the Alba party, also accused the SNP of \"blatant lies\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme - prior to Mr Foote stepping down - Mr Salmond said the SNP's loss of members was \"catastrophic\", but \"more important is the reduction in credibility\".\n\nNicola Sturgeon's chief adviser Liz Lloyd also announced on Friday that she would be stepping down from the role when the first minister leaves office.\n\nShe said it had been the \"biggest honour of my life\" to have worked with Ms Sturgeon but that she planned to pursue new opportunities outside politics.\n\nEarlier in the week the Scottish Sun had reported Ms Lloyd was advising Mr Yousaf's campaign.\n\nMurray Foote's former colleagues have been highlighting his integrity as they react to his departure from the SNP.\n\nIt was a surprise for many when the man who helped created the unionist \"Vow\" during the 2014 independence campaign joined the party.\n\nBut he's relished his task - although now it ends in tears.\n\nIn the resignation statement, he emphasises how \"in good faith\" he gave the inaccurate membership numbers provided by the party.\n\nHis former journalistic colleagues were furious at how they'd been treated and, it seems, so is he.\n\nMr Foote says this created a \"serious impediment\" to his role.\n\nSo who gave the figures to him? There are now big questions for SNP HQ and its chief executive, Peter Murrell.\n\nAs the leadership race continues, it's tearing through the SNP, wreaking havoc.\n\nThe SNP's membership hit a peak of 125,000 in 2019 as support for the party surged in the wake of the independence referendum but had dropped to 85,000 by the end of last year.\n\nThat suggests a drop of 12,000 inside a matter of months.\n\nAfter the most recent membership figures were released, Kate Forbes' campaign manager, Michelle Thomson MSP, said she was pleased that \"common sense has prevailed\" - but that the \"alarming drop in members shows that the party needs a change in direction\".\n\nAsh Regan's campaign linked the decline to the Scottish government's controversial gender recognition reforms while the party's president Mike Russell suggested cost of living pressures could offer an alternative explanation.\n\nThe third candidate in the contest, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, said it was \"really important\" the SNP did not lose any more members but said the best way to do this was to continue with the party's \"progressive agenda\".\n\nFollowing Mr Foote's departure on Friday, Mr Yousaf tweeted that he would be sorely missed, and added: \"Reform of our HQ operations has been a key part of my campaign. With fresh party leadership should come a fresh approach to our HQ operation.\"", "It will be \"His Majesty\" whose name appears on UK passports from this week\n\nThe first British passports issued in King Charles's name are being released this week, the Home Office has said.\n\nPassports will now use the wording \"His Majesty\", with the era finally ending for passports using \"Her Majesty\", for the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe last time \"His Majesty\" appeared on a passport was in the reign of King George VI, which ended in 1952.\n\nFive million passports have been issued already this year under the name of the late Queen.\n\nThe one person who will not need a passport is the King himself. By convention the monarch does not have to carry a passport to travel, because it is a document issued in his own name.\n\nThe updated passports are the latest stage in the gradual transition in reigns, with stamps and some coins now carrying the King's head. Banknotes will begin to change next year.\n\nSince the late Queen's death last September there has been a steady process of switching to images and insignia of the new King, with an emphasis on using up existing stocks rather than having an abrupt change.\n\nIt will be the same for passports, with any existing supplies with \"Her Majesty\" being used until they run out, alongside the arrival of the new version.\n\nThe new passports will now carry the words: \"His Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State requests and requires in the name of His Majesty...\"\n\nBut the previous \"Her Majesty\" passports will also continue to be valid until their expiry date.\n\nHome Secretary Suella Braverman said: \"For 70 years, Her Majesty has appeared on British passports and many of us will not remember a time when she did not feature. Today marks a significant moment in UK history.\"\n\nAfter problems with delays to issuing passports last year and industrial action this year, the Home Office says 99% of passports are being issued within 10 weeks of application.\n\nUK passports in their modern form, with photo and signature, have been issued since 1915, with the first security watermark being added in 1972 and machine-readable passports introduced in 1988.\n\nIn 2020, after leaving the European Union, UK passports changed from a burgundy colour, used since 1988, to dark blue.\n\nThis was described as returning to an \"iconic blue\", which prompted arguments on social media over the colour of new and old passports, with debates over whether the pre-EU and post-EU versions were really blue or black.\n\nGet the latest royal news from our weekly free newsletter - sign up here.", "Adam Price says he no longer had the support of his party\n\nAdam Price has quit as Plaid Cymru leader after a report found misogyny, harassment and bullying in the party.\n\nNorth Wales Senedd member Llyr Gruffydd will take over as interim leader, with a new leader in place in the summer, the party has said.\n\nIt follows months of difficulties including allegations of a sexual assault made against a senior staff member, and a toxic working culture.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Price said he no longer had the \"united support\" of his colleagues.\n\nHe said he wanted to resign in the wake of the report's findings, but was initially persuaded not to quit.\n\n\"You have my personal assurance that I will continue to serve my country, my constituents and our party with determination and enthusiasm,\" he said in a letter to party chairman, Marc Jones.\n\nOn Thursday Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said discussions on his co-operation agreement with Plaid will take place \"in light of recent developments\"\n\nHe thanked Mr Price \"for the constructive way the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru have worked together\".\n\nThe resignation announcement was made following a meeting of the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), late on Wednesday night.\n\nOne source from the meeting said some members raised the possibility of Adam Price remaining in post.\n\nBut it was considered untenable given the seriousness of the findings of the review.\n\nPlaid's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Price was not asked to resign in the wake of the \"toxic culture\" report because \"stability\" was needed to implement its recommendations.\n\nInterim Plaid Cymru leader Llyr Gruffydd has been in the Senedd since 2011\n\nSpeaking on the Today programme, Liz Saville Roberts said: \"Effective leadership is about balancing conflicting demands.\n\n\"What we felt strongly was that we needed a collegiate approach within the party because it (the report) cuts across all aspects of the party and it requires a change of culture\".\n\n\"In order to do that we would need stability\".\n\nShe also told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that Mr Price had to go because he had become a \"distraction\".\n\nShe ruled herself out of a leadership contest, saying any new leader would have to be an elected member in the Senedd.\n\n\"I'm an MP in Westminster so that's done and dusted,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Adam Price apologised last week but said the damning report points to a \"collective failure\" across the party\n\nMr Gruffydd's appointment as interim leader was agreed at a meeting of the party's Senedd members on Thursday and will need to be rubber-stamped by Plaid Cymru's National Council on Saturday.\n\nHe will not stand in the forthcoming leadership contest\n\nMr Gruffydd said he was \"grateful to the Plaid Cymru Senedd group\" for the nomination and thanked Mr Price for his \"vision, commitment, and dedication\".\n\nPlaid Cymru is the third largest party in the Welsh Parliament, with 12 Members of the Senedd and three MPs in Westminster.\n\nThe pro-independence party is in a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government, which means they help them govern.\n\nMr Price was elected party leader in 2018, when he ousted Leanne Wood.\n\nWelsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: \"I have no doubt Adam Price's departure is a moment of personal sadness for him.\n\n\"Following the recent report into the culture within their party, it became clear Plaid Cymru politicians no longer had confidence in his leadership, so his departure became inevitable.\"\n\nFor the converted, the die-hard believers, it wasn't meant to be like this.\n\nAdam Price was touted by many in Plaid Cymru as a \"once in a generation\" politician who could overcome the party's many electoral barriers.\n\nWhen he challenged his predecessor for the leadership in 2018, he said only he could \"create the momentum\" Plaid needed to become Wales' main party of government and install him as first minister.\n\nAnd yet, there was no great advance at the following Senedd election - Plaid remains in third place behind the Welsh Conservatives.\n\nSupporters will say it was an election like no other, one focused almost entirely on the public's broadly favourable opinion of the Welsh Labour government's handling of the pandemic.\n\nIt is clear, though, that some of the sheen had faded and in terms of public support, the party remains no further forward under Adam Price's leadership.\n\nAs it nears its 100th birthday celebrations, Plaid Cymru will seek its 11th leader with many of the perennial questions about its purpose, its lack of reach beyond the heartlands and its relationship with Welsh Labour likely to be raised.\n\nBut it is the drip, drip of negative stories over the last year, culminating in a damning report that found a toxic culture within the party that meant Adam Price's position was no longer tenable.\n\nAddressing those major issues will be his successor's primary focus.\n\nSince last year Plaid Cymru has been dogged by claims of a toxic culture in the party, and it emerged last November that an allegation of sexual assault had been made against a senior member of staff.\n\nSeparately, a serious allegation was also made about the conduct of a Member of the Senedd, Rhys ab Owen, who is now suspended from the Senedd group pending an investigation.\n\nThe party asked Nerys Evans, a lobbyist and former Plaid assembly member, to hold a review last December.\n\nHer working group's report said Plaid needed to \"detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny\".\n\nIt said too many instances of bad behaviour were tolerated, and said an anonymous survey of staff and elected members highlighted examples \"of sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination\".\n\nMr Price admitted the document left Plaid Cymru \"harmed and tarnished\". He apologised, but refused to quit.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Price said: \"On receiving the report, I informed you that I felt morally bound to step down as leader of the party in recognition of our collective failure.\"\n\n\"You counselled against my resignation as you felt it would make it more difficult to achieve progress in implementing the recommendations.\"\n\nHe said he was \"persuaded by the argument that my stepping down would be an abdication of responsibility\".\n\nBut he added: \"It is now clear I no longer have the united support of my colleagues that would be necessary to follow this course to fruition.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said: \"I want to thank Adam Price for the constructive way the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru have worked together to develop and implement the co-operation agreement. These shared priorities are making a real difference to people across Wales.\n\n\"The co-operation agreement is an agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru - not between individuals. There will be discussions about the agreement in light of recent developments.\"", "The monarchy is at a time of transition. The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II had significant family turmoil, but was largely a period of stability and continuity for the monarchy. There is now a new king.\n\nBut is public opinion about the monarchy changing too? Recent visits by King Charles have seen anti-monarchy protesters making their presence noisily felt, alongside those showing support for the new reign.\n\nThose anti-monarchists have acknowledged that they would have been reluctant to carry out such protests when the late queen was alive, because of the risk of antagonising the public. But now it seems the gloves are off.\n\nTo gauge the public mood ahead of the coronation, Panorama commissioned a new YouGov opinion poll. The results suggest broad support for keeping the monarchy, with 58% preferring it to an elected head of state - which was supported by 26%.\n\nBut, below these headline figures the poll points to attitude shifts under way - with some clear popularity challenges for the new king at the start of his reign.\n\nIn particular, the monarchy seems to have a problem appealing to young people.\n\nWhile over-65s were the most likely to be supportive of the monarchy at 78%, 18-24 year olds were the least likely. Only 32% backed the monarchy. This younger group was more likely, at 38%, to prefer an elected head of state, although the remaining 30% didn't know.\n\nIndifference could be an issue as much as opposition, with 78% of the younger age group saying they were \"not interested\" in the Royal Family.\n\nSo what are the difficult issues facing the new reign?\n\nThe wealth of the Royal Family, at a time of cost-of-living pressures, is one factor that seems to sharply divide the age groups.\n\nAs a headline figure, 54% of people in this online survey of 4,592 UK adults say the monarchy represents good value - compared with 32% who think it represents bad value.\n\nBut the younger group polled - those aged 18-24 - were more likely, at 40%, to think the monarchy is bad value for money, while 36% thought the opposite.\n\nThe Royal Family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch an RAF flypast - marking the Queen's birthday in 2019\n\n\"The number of palaces is absurd. Frankly, you need one palace for state occasions, Buckingham Palace, and perhaps one other for when they want to retire to the country,\" says former Lib Dem minister and critic of royal funding, Norman Baker.\n\nHe also highlights what he claims is an overuse of helicopters and private jets when the King is \"lecturing people about climate change\".\n\nSuch accusations are rejected by Lord Nicholas Soames, a friend of the King's for many years, who says using a helicopter would only be for a \"very good purpose\" on public duties.\n\n\"This is not done as a sort of jaunt,\" he says.\n\nConstitutional expert Sir Vernon Bogdanor also doesn't accept the financial criticism.\n\n\"I think the Royal Family give, on the whole, very good value for money. And the only people who receive money are those who undertake public duties.\"\n\nBut there are public sensitivities about spending, as highlighted in another YouGov poll last week, which found a majority of people did not believe that the government should pay for the coronation.\n\nHow much the coronation will cost, in terms of public spending, won't be revealed by the government until after the event.\n\nWith an exclusive opinion poll ahead of the coronation, Panorama asks if the new King will adapt the monarchy to suit modern times.\n\nWatch - Will King Charles Change the Monarchy? on BBC One at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales) on Monday 24 April and also on iPlayer (UK only)\n\nThere have also been recent newspaper investigations into royal funding which have questioned the boundaries of private and public funding for the royals - including the status of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, estates which each generate more than \u00a320m in profits for the royals.\n\nAccording to Mr Baker, these holdings of land and property should be seen as \"public assets\" and \"the money that they raise in terms of profit should go to the taxpayer to fund public services\", instead of being \"diverted into royal coffers\".\n\nIn response Buckingham Palace says the Duchy of Cornwall funds the public, private and charitable activities of the heir to the throne - while the Duchy of Lancaster helps fund the sovereign so they are not otherwise a \"burden on the state\".\n\nProf Anna Whitelock, a historian at City University who explores the place of the monarchy in modern Britain, questions why a new monarch does not have to pay inheritance tax on the death of a previous sovereign.\n\nBut the Palace points out that decisions about funding and taxation are decided by the government, not by the Royal Family themselves.\n\nNonetheless, questions over the opacity of royal finances seem likely to continue and the scale of uncertainty is suggested by the size of the different conclusions from two separate recent newspaper investigations into the King's wealth - one saying he was worth \u00a3600m and another \u00a31.8bn.\n\nQuestions over money might feed into doubts about how well the royals can empathise with the experiences of the public.\n\nThe polling of UK adults for Panorama - carried out between 14 and 17 April - suggests more people believe the King is \"out of touch\" by 45% to 36%.\n\nBut the King has had decades of working through his charities to support disadvantaged families - and Dame Martina Milburn, former chief executive of the Prince's Trust, praised his ability to communicate with a wide range of people. \"I've literally been with him in prisons, in youth offending institutes, in job centres - and he can make that connection, it is quite extraordinary,\" she says.\n\nAlthough Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, suggests polling reflects an often under-reported level of opposition to the monarchy. \"Across the country there are millions of people who want the monarchy abolished,\" he says.\n\nAnother intense area of sensitivity for the Royal Family has been perceptions of their attitudes towards race.\n\nFrom the fallout with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to the high-profile row over the treatment of black charity founder Ngozi Fulani at a Buckingham Palace reception - it has been a thorny subject.\n\nThe scale of the challenge is suggested in the YouGov polling which found people from ethnic minority backgrounds were less likely to support the monarchy. Of that group, 40% wanted an elected head of state rather than a monarchy. Similarly, people from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to think the royals have a \"problem with race and diversity\", with 49% saying they thought the royals did have a problem - while the overall percentage, regardless of background, was 32%.\n\nIn November, King Charles attended an art exhibition in Leeds which explored the UK's role in slavery\n\nLord Soames strongly rejects any suggestions of racism. \"There's not a racist drop of blood in the King,\" he says.\n\nBuckingham Palace says the King and the Royal Household treat all matters of race and diversity with great seriousness - pointing to the \"swift and robust\" response to the Ngozi Fulani row as evidence. It says it has also carried out a review of its diversity and inclusion policies.\n\nBut this is also an issue affecting relations outside the UK, including the Commonwealth, where questions are being raised about the legacy of colonialism and slavery.\n\nIn a speech to Commonwealth leaders in Rwanda last year, the then Prince Charles spoke of the \"depths of his personal sorrow\" at the suffering caused by the slave trade.\n\nIn another speech - during last autumn's visit of the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa - the King said: \"We must acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past if we are to unlock the power of our common future.\"\n\nBut Sir Hilary Beckles - a historian in Barbados and chairman of the Caricom Reparations Commission - says more action is needed because, at present, the relationship between the monarchy and the Caribbean is \"tense\".\n\n\"That tension can easily be alleviated by the King pursuing a reparatory justice path that begins with language of apology, and then evolves into practical, everyday activity that will help to promote Caribbean economic development,\" he says.\n\nBuckingham Palace says Historic Royal Palaces - a charity which looks after six sites including the Tower of London and Kensington Palace - is a partner in an independent research project exploring the links between the British monarchy and the slave trade. King Charles takes the issue profoundly seriously, it says.\n\nThe polling for Panorama might raise questions about a moment of change for the monarchy.\n\nBut it's also something of a picture of continuity. The overall findings show broad support for the monarchy, alongside a sizeable minority of sceptics.\n\nMany polls over the years have found something similar, with rises and falls alongside the changing headlines.\n\nThe popularity of the royals seemed to reach a high point around 2011-2012, the era of Prince William and Kate's wedding and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.\n\nThere has been a downward drift in the following years and the rows surrounding Prince Harry's book, Spare, earlier this year saw the approval ratings for the royals take a hit - but that doesn't necessarily mean they won't recover.\n\nIt will also depend on how much young people maintain their current trend of a rising lack of enthusiasm for the monarchy. The long-running British Social Attitudes survey has previously found that people's views tend to become more sympathetic to the monarchy as they get older.\n\nThe new reign will be watching carefully and hoping that pattern continues.\n\nThe figures in the YouGov poll for Panorama have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults.

Natasha says there's no amount of time Nicholas Bateman can do in prison that will be enough\n\nA mother whose baby was shaken by his father so violently he suffered brain damage has spoken of her relief that he has finally been jailed.\n\nNatasha, 27, was out of the family home in March 2018 when Nicholas Bateman, 31, assaulted their son.\n\nThe next day, the seven-week-old boy began having seizures and would go on to develop cerebral palsy.\n\nMore than five years later, Bateman was finally jailed last week for causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\n\"I always hoped and wished that justice would be served. It went on one year, two years, now we've hit the five-year mark,\" said Natasha, whose surname is not being reported in order to protect her son's identity.\n\n\"I started to think 'is he going to get away with it? Is he going to walk free?'\"\n\nOn 9 March 2018, while Natasha popped to a doctors appointment, Bateman phoned her to say their son had bumped his lip on his shoulder.\n\nBut when she returned home her son was lying limp on the sofa.\n\nAfter a call to emergency services Natasha was told to administer CPR before the boy was taken into hospital.\n\nThe following day he began suffering from seizures and Natasha was told to prepare for the worst as he was put into an induced coma.\n\nAfter medical examinations, doctors found the baby had multiple fractures including a bleed on his brain.\n\nThe injuries caused multiple seizures resulting in brain damage and later a diagnosis of cerebral palsy.\n\nStill, Bateman's only explanation was that his son had banged his lip.\n\nOn the baby boy's final day in hospital, to her shock, both Natasha and Bateman were arrested.\n\nAs she had been the person to call emergency services for help and Bateman was keeping to his story, police placed her as being at the property at the time of the incident.\n\nBut Natasha said their arrests was the moment she knew her son had been intentionally hurt.\n\n\"(My son) came back with multiple fractures and it was indicating shaken baby syndrome. I knew I didn't do it and the only other person that could have done it was Nicholas.\n\n\"In hospital he just seemed like a sad father that wanted his child to get better. But knowing he put him in that situation, he hasn't shown any remorse.\"\n\nNatasha said no sentence would be enough for her ex partner's assault on her son\n\nIt wasn't just authorities who had suspicions about her role in the baby's injuries. The police and ambulance workers who attended the aftermath of the incident had inevitably caught the attention of neighbours.\n\n\"People judged, people were staring thinking 'did she do it, will it come out?',\" she said.\n\n\"They'd judge me and I was like, I didn't need to give them an explanation. The people that knew I didn't do it, thankfully, like my family and friends, knew I couldn't do something like that.\"\n\nNatasha's son was made the subject of family court proceedings, and had to live with his grandparents while authorities worked out who was responsible for his injuries.\n\nNatasha, said: \"Still he (Bateman) didn't admit to nothing at all. He even tried telling people that I was lying about my son being disabled.\"\n\nNicholas Bateman was jailed for more than 10 years for assaulting his son\n\nBut after eight months of proceedings, Bateman was charged by police with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. No further action was taken against Natasha.\n\nThere were years of criminal court delays, in part due to the start of the coronavirus pandemic and Bateman's denials that he had harmed his son.\n\nAfter many court appearances, and just over five years on the from the assault, Bateman eventually pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court on 21 March.\n\nHe was sentenced to 10 years and nine months in jail at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court on 4 May.\n\nJudge Lucy Crowther told the sentencing hearing that Bateman had likely first gripped the little boy around his face and chest before \"violently\" shaking him and throwing him onto a soft surface.\n\n\"You shook him when he wouldn't stop crying. You were just too frightened to say what you had done,\" the judge said.\n\nNatasha said despite her relief that justice has finally been served, she feels there is \"no amount of time\" that Bateman can serve \"that will be enough for what he's done\".\n\n\"To hear him say (he is guilty) is something we've all wanted to hear. But then to hear him say it five years later is too late. He hasn't had to see what he has done. He's lived a normal life. He's carried on with his life\".\n\nShe said her son cannot talk, walk or stand without assistance. He struggles to eat a normal diet and survives mainly on yoghurts. He also cannot sleep without medication and doesn't have much of a pain threshold.\n\n\"I always look at him and I think 'why?' He was only seven weeks old,\" said Natasha, from Rhondda Cynon Taf in south Wales.\n\n\"I don't know what his future will be. We'll always show him love, he will always be happy. But there will be ways where he will suffer.\n\n\"I don't know if he will be able to go out on his own, or have a family. He's had that taken away from him.\n\n\"I don't want to say it, but I think he will be his mum's boy for the rest of his life and I'll take care of him for the rest of his life.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The chancellor said his first Budget will give \"nearly five times more help\" for parents dealing with child care costs.\n\nJeremy Hunt insists his Budget will get young parents and over-50s back into work - and it will not just benefit the rich who are saving for retirement.\n\nThe chancellor told the BBC he wanted to fill a million vacancies across the UK so firms can \"grow faster\".\n\nHe plans to expand free childcare in England and scrap the \u00a31m cap for tax-free pension savings.\n\nLabour has said it will reverse the pension move if elected, calling it a \"tax cut for the top 1%\".\n\nIt was \"the wrong priority, at the wrong time\", said shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. Labour has said it would target the pensions tax cut at NHS doctors if it wins power.\n\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Hunt claimed the UK economy would avoid a recession, with inflation predicted to more than halve by the end of this year.\n\nBut he said a shortage of workers was holding back growth, and he wanted more over-50s, people with disabilities and parents of young children to get back to work.\n\nOffering eligible working parents with children as young as nine months in England 30 hours of free childcare is a key part of the plan - but it will not be introduced fully until September 2025.\n\nMr Hunt said he would like to have extended childcare help sooner but it first needed a big increase in the number of childminders and nurseries.\n\nAs well as scrapping the \u00a31m cap on the amount people can save for their pensions before it is taxed extra, he increased the annual tax-free allowance on pensions from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000.\n\nThe changes aim to encourage senior teachers and doctors to keep working.\n\nAsked about criticism that it was a \"Budget for the rich\", allowing people who are already well off to save more for their pensions, he said: \"Well, of course we want to help older people who want to stay in work.\n\n\"By definition, they will generally be on higher salaries, but nearly five times more help is going to young parents to help them with childcare costs, a nearly 60% reduction in childcare costs of \u00a36,500 a child.\n\n\"That will make a huge difference to families.

Tory Budget shows 'just how out of touch they are' - Starmer\n\nThe government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), says the chancellor's policies are likely to add about 110,000 people to the UK workforce, depending on how they react to the various incentives.\n\nAsked why after 13 years of a Conservative government a whole generation is not doing as well as their parents had, Mr Hunt said his growth plan meant \"better jobs and better opportunities\".\n\n\"We had half a million people who left the labour force during the lockdowns,\" he added. \"That's an effect you haven't seen in other countries and that's why I've announced the measures I've announced today to encourage people back to work.\"\n\nOne senior government figure described it as \"a steady-as-she-goes Budget\", after the turbulence of Liz Truss's short-lived premiership.\n\nThe OBR said the UK economy would shrink by 0.2% this year, which is better than previously forecast and does not, technically, count as a recession.\n\nInflation is forecast to fall from 10.7% in the final quarter of last year to 2.9% by the end of 2023.\n\nLiving standards are still expected to fall by the largest amount since records began, according to the OBR, but the decline will not be as bad as it had forecast in November.\n\nThe economy is predicted to return to growth - but house prices are projected to fall by 10% by 2025.\n\nThe OBR also highlighted Rishi Sunak's April 2021 decision, when he was chancellor, to freeze tax thresholds, which it said amounted to the equivalent of a 4p increase in the basic rate of income tax.\n\nThat move, dubbed a \"stealth tax\" by critics, is due to come into effect next month and will increase government income by \u00a329.3bn a year.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday morning, Mr Hunt admitted \"for a while the tax burden will be higher\" due to costs incurred during the pandemic and on subsidising energy costs.\n\n\"These things have to be paid for\", he said, adding \"it's the right thing to do to get through this difficult period\". He said the government wants to cut taxes \"when we can\".\n\nPressed on why childcare reforms will take years to roll out, he described the changes as \"the biggest in my lifetime\" and said the sector needs time to adjust to a new surge in demand.\n\nHe also defended the decision to remove the lifetime allowance on pension pots as a measure which will help the NHS retain doctors who otherwise might opt for early retirement or to cut their hours.\n\nLabour's Rachel Reeves said the policy is a tax giveaway for the \"top 1%\" and should have been targeted at the health sector, rather than applied more broadly.\n\nSome Tory MPs were disappointed by the decision to go ahead with a planned rise to corporation tax next month.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt said that businesses would be able to deduct money they invest in IT equipment and machinery from their taxable profits for the next three years.\n\nThere was no announcement in this Budget of extra money for public sector pay, as a wave of strikes by workers including junior doctors, teachers and rail staff continues.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Hunt also pledged an expansion in wraparound care at the start and finish of the school day for parents with older children and changes to staff-to-child ratios in England to expand supply of childcare, although the target date for the measure was September 2026.\n\nAnd he announced plans to abolish Work Capability Assessments, which he said would \"separate benefit entitlement from an individual's ability to work\".\n\nFrom 2026, the government will use another test, currently used to assess eligibility for Personal Independence Payments, the main disability benefit, to decide if someone is eligible for additional payments.\n\nOther measures unveiled in the Budget include:\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"After 13 years of his government, our economy needed major surgery, but like millions across our country, this Budget leaves us stuck in the waiting room with only a sticking plaster to hand.\n\n\"A country set on a path of managed decline, falling behind our competitors, the sick man of Europe once again.\"\n\nSNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie said: \"It's truly pathetic that the chancellor has failed to cut energy bills, despite having ample resources to do so.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak had a chance to show they care about the cost-of-living crisis that's hitting millions of Britain's families and pensioners but they failed miserably.\"\n\nHow has the Budget affected you?

They said that was normal commercial practice.\n\nTheir lawyers argued they were merely selecting from a range of accurate interest rates on offer on the market. They argued that the prosecution had offered no proof that they could not borrow at the quoted rates. Therefore there was no proof they had asked for anything false. The Court of Appeal dismissed the traders' appeal, saying they should only have quoted the cheapest interest rates available.\n\nHowever, that ruling has sown confusion. At the appeal hearing, Serious Fraud Office (SFO) prosecutor James Hines told the defendants' legal team that it \"was never part of our case\" that banks must quote the lowest interest rate available.\n\nMuch of the evidence the SFO brought against the traders was requests for \"low\" rates. Those requests would appear to be entirely lawful based on the judges' ruling.\n\nLord Mackay said: \"After taking a close interest in their cases, it didn't look like they were doing anything dishonest. They were doing their best as far as they understood.\n\n\"Although there's differences in the law between the United States and ourselves in relation to contracts, the reason for overturning convictions before the US court was a very essential part of the substance of this particular matter. And I think it's worth our Supreme Court being invited to consider it.\"\n\nSir David said: \"The judges have let a technical concern about contracts override the far more important point, which is what these cases are supposed to be all about. Was what the traders did dishonest? And if you look closely enough, the answer is a clear \"no\".'\n\nMr McDonnell called the convictions a \"grave miscarriage of justice\" and said he found the Court of Appeal judges' decision \"bewildering\".\n\nIn January 2022, a US court of appeal concluded the traders did not break any rules and overturned all such convictions, leaving the UK as the only country where what they did remains criminalised.\n\nUK Court of Appeal judges said the case which overturned all convictions in the United States, where former Deutsche Bank traders Matt Connolly and Gavin Black were fully acquitted, was irrelevant to the UK because it took a different approach to contract law.", "Last updated on .From the section Wales\n\nCoverage: Live on BBC One Wales, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website & app & live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app.\n\nJess Fishlock says Wales are determined to reach their first major finals in what is likely to be her final campaign.\n\nFishlock, 37, is bidding to reach 150 caps as Rhian Wilkinson's side face Croatia and Kosovo in their opening qualifiers this month.\n\nBut the Seattle Reign midfielder accepts her time as a Wales player may be coming to an end.\n\n\"I am 37 now and probably this is going to be my last campaign,\" she said.\n\nFishlock considered quitting after Wales' World Cup qualifying hopes were ended after a play-off defeat by Switzerland in October 2022.\n\n\"After the Switzerland game, I really thought about quitting, it was very hard.

If they are going to do that they should always act on the advice of the Foreign Office travel advice.\n\n\"If there are risks to people's safety, if they're a British citizen abroad, then the UK government is going to do whatever it takes to ensure that they're safe.\n\n\"The government is in negotiations and working hard to ensure people's safety is upheld.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office said it was working hard to contact the men.\n\nThe Presidium Network is a UK-based non-profit organisation that provides support to communities in crisis, representing the needs of people affected by violence or poverty to international policy makers.\n\nMr Richards confirmed the organisation is representing Mr Cornwell, a paramedic who works for a charity, and the second unnamed man but not the third British national.\n\nMr Richards said while there were \"no official charges as such\", the two men's detention on 11 January was understood to be over a weapon in a safe in Mr Cornwell's room, which he said was stored with a licence issued by the Afghan interior ministry.\n\n\"That license is missing,\" he said, adding: \"But we have taken several statements from witnesses who have seen the licence and affirm its existence.\n\n\"It is perfectly possible that during the search the licence was separated from the weapon and, as such, why we refer to this scenario as a probable misunderstanding.\"\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Iqarus - the charity Mr Cornwell has worked with as a medic - said it had been \"working tirelessly, alongside the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to secure Kevin's release\".\n\n\"These efforts are our top priority and are ongoing,\" it said.\n\nThe third man is understood to be Miles Routledge, 23, from Birmingham, who was evacuated from Afghanistan by British Armed Forces in August 2021.\n\nMiles Routledge said previously he travelled to Afghanistan as he enjoys \"dark\" and \"extreme\" tourism\n\nThe former Loughborough University student has attracted attention by travelling to dangerous countries and posting about it on social media.\n\nHe previously shared that he chose Afghanistan because he enjoyed \"dark\" and \"extreme\" tourism.\n\nFollowing his extraction from the country less than two years ago, he told the BBC he was \"exhausted but relieved\" and thanked the British Army who had been deployed to support the evacuation of UK nationals from Kabul.\n\nMr Richard told Sky News: \"To our knowledge and awareness, we do believe they are in good health and being well treated.\n\n\"We have no reason to believe they've been subject to any negative treatment such as torture and we're told that they are as good as can be expected in such circumstances.\"\n\nHe added that there has been \"no meaningful contact\" between authorities and the two men Presidium is assisting.", "Silvio Berlusconi's children, including his daughter Marina (R), visited the former prime minister at the hospital\n\nItaly's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is being treated for a type of chronic leukaemia, hospital doctors in Milan have confirmed.\n\nHe was rushed to intensive care on Wednesday with breathing problems and doctors said he was suffering from a related lung infection.\n\nA four-time prime minister and media mogul, Mr Berlusconi, 86, still leads his party and is an elected senator.\n\nBut he has had repeated health problems since he contracted Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nColleagues have expressed hope that he will still be able to return to front-line politics as he continues to lead Forza Italia, a centre-right junior partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition.\n\n\"We want to be optimistic,\" said Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister and one of the most senior figures in Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.\n\nAs Italians waited for more details, the billionaire media tycoon's younger brother, Paolo, told reporters the family was now feeling confident: \"We're more relieved, there's an improvement.\"\n\nMr Berlusconi also took phone calls from the prime minister and fellow coalition ally Matteo Salvini, reports said.\n\nHe has combined politics with a business career at the helm of a media empire. He last served as prime minister in 2011, although his latter years in power became overshadowed by sex and corruption scandals.\n\nHe was elected to Italy's upper house, the Senate, last September but has repeatedly required hospital treatment. He returned to hospital in Milan on Wednesday only six days after he was discharged following days of check-ups.\n\nHis personal doctor, Alberto Zangrillo, said his lung infection was related to a chronic blood condition that he had borne for some time but that it had not yet become acute. Earlier reports said he had begun chemotherapy to fight the leukaemia.\n\n\"He's stable. He's a rock. He's going to make this time too.\" said his younger brother Paolo Berlusconi earlier.\n\nHis return to hospital has caused concern in Italy and politicians from across the spectrum have wished him well. Ms Meloni has wished him a speedy recovery, tweeting the words \"Forza Silvio\" - \"Come on Silvio!\", echoing the name of his political party.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9e Marta Fascina, who is an MP in his party, spent the night with him in the hospital and his children visited him on Thursday for a second time.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi was elected to Italy's upper house last September after being temporarily barred from office\n\nForza Italia officials said their leader had spoken on Thursday morning to party figures including Mr Tajani and Maurizio Gasparri, vice president of the Senate.\n\nMr Berlusconi remains a divisive figure in Italian politics. Earlier this year, he was finally cleared of bribing young showgirls to lie about his notoriously raunchy \"bunga bunga\" parties.\n\nHowever, both left-leaning and right-leaning newspapers have paid tribute to the charismatic, yet controversial, politician and media tycoon.\n\nSeveral newspapers have wished him well, while others have highlighted the potential impact of his illness on the country's political landscape.\n\n\"Everyone with Silvio\" was the main headline in Il Giornale, which belongs to the Berlusconi family, expressing its support and solidarity.\n\nLike the prime minister, Libero, another right-leaning newspaper, opted for \"Forza Silvio\", while La Repubblica called him the \"fearless Knight\". The centre-left daily has for decades strongly criticised his political actions and extensively covered the repeated scandals surrounding Mr Berlusconi.\n\nAlthough his entourage has downplayed the seriousness of his condition, his illness has raised questions about the future of his political party.\n\nForza Italia may be part of the ruling coalition but it has been in decline in recent years, and Mr Berlusconi's declining health may further weaken its position. When Mr Tajani spoke to reporters, he said there was only one party leader: \"Now let's hope he returns to lead the party.\"\n\nHis condition has also revived questions about the future of the Berlusconi business empire, which includes several television channels and publishing companies, making him one of the most influential media moguls in Italy.\n\nHis family also owns a minority stake in football club AC Monza, which has climbed from the third tier of Italian football to Serie A during his five-year ownership.\n\n\"Warm wishes, dear president, from the whole big red-and-white family,\" tweeted club president Adriano Galliani.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

All of this is not for Nahel,\" they told the BBC, speaking on condition of anonymity because tensions are so high following Nahel's shooting.\n\nThey said they had called for a \"White March in the street.

According to Reuters news agency most of those victims have been of black or Arab origin.\n\nAnais, a family friend and neighbour also told the BBC that being a young black man in France's suburbs meant being subject to racism, violence and racial profiling on a daily basis.\n\n\"They [the police] humiliate, insult and don't speak properly to them.

The bus had rolled over while making a turn at a roundabout off a highway. Authorities say the vehicle has now been pulled upright.\n\nNew South Wales Police acting assistant commissioner Tracy Chapman said the guests were travelling to Singleton \"presumably for their accommodation\". Two of the survivors were airlifted from the crash, she added.

I remember feeling something. It was a pretty scary day.\"\n\nMs Guthrie asked Ms Zwerner about her left hand, which appeared on camera wrapped in medical gauze.\n\n\"The initial gunshot went through my left hand and ruptured the middle bone as well as the index finger and the thumb. The gunshot then went into my chest up here where it actually still remains,\" she said, while pointing just above her heart. \"So, I have a scar up here, and I still have some bullet fragments up here.\"\n\nMs Zwerner said doctors at the hospital told her the gunshot wound \"could've been fatal\" but since the bullet went through her hand it \"most likely saved my life\".\n\nIn the initial moments after she was shot, Ms Zwerner said her first thoughts were about the safety of her students. She ushered them out of the classroom despite her wounds before she was sent to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\nEarlier this month Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney Howard Gwynn said that his office would not seek charges against the boy. He said the \"prospect that a six-year-old can stand trial is problematic\" because the child is too young to understand the legal system, he told NBC News.\n\nThe family of the young boy, who have also not been charged, has said he suffered from an \"acute disability\" and rarely attended school without one of his parents being present. However, the day of the shooting he had attended school alone.\n\nThe firearm was legally purchased and belonged to the child's mother, police have said.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, the school's superintendent was fired and the assistant principal resigned.

who has played Kevin Webster in the soap for 40 years - told the court he was a \"very private person\" who only gave his mobile phone number to \"close friends and family\".\n\nTaken through numerous newspaper articles from the early 1990s, Mr Turner repeatedly conceded, \"yes, looks that way\", when it was put to him that information he claims came from hacking his voicemail messages had also appeared in other newspaper reports.\n\nOn claims that information about the impending birth of his daughter - including the fact she was overdue and his then-wife had suffered some complications - had come from hacking of his voicemail in 1995, Mr Turner conceded that he had given an interview in The Sun where he spoke in detail about the prospect of becoming a father.\n\n\"Looks that way, yes,\" was his response when it was put to him by MGN's barrister that he had spoken to the media about it.\n\nMr Turner told the court that he would likely have passed on such details about the pregnancy in voicemails, to his on-screen wife Sally Dynevor, but the court was also shown a News of the World article from September 1995 that described how he and his wife - who was heavily pregnant at the time - had attended a wedding and been in a pub.\n\nOn how details of a burglary at his home in 1993 emerged, and the revelation that his niece had subsequently given him money from her lottery jackpot winnings, Mr Turner was shown a previous article in which he was quoted as saying his wife was \"very upset\" and describing the \"bad world\" we live in.\n\nAsked by MGN's barrister if it was clear he had spoken to a reporter about the break in Mr Turner said: \"Yes, looks that way\".\n\nIn written evidence, Mr Turner said some colleagues thought he was leaking information to the tabloid press, particularly because he was a trade union representative and was privy to very personal information about them.\n\nHe added that many of professional relationships \"cooled\" after this, and that while many people now \"know the truth\", the actions of journalists caused \"irreversible damage\" to his friendships and reputation.\n\n\"I also became extremely paranoid about stories coming out and blamed innocent people close to me. I didn't know who I could trust,\" he said, adding that he started to treat friends with the same level of suspicion he had received from colleagues.\n\nClosing his cross examination, MGN barrister Richard Munden asked Mr Turner about his claim that he'd been labelled a \"mole\" by fellow Coronation Street actor Craig Charles.\n\nMr Turner said he was \"mortified\" by the claim, adding: \"Being a mole and leaking is one of the worst things you could do in our business.\"\n\nAsked how long Mr Charles had been in the cast of the soap at the time of the alleged exchange, Mr Turner told the court he was \"very new\" and may have been there only nine to 10 months.\n\nWhen asked as a final question how he came to think he may have been a victim of phone hacking, over a decade, by journalists at MGN, Mr Turner said: \"It just seems to be a few coincidences, let's say.\"\n\nMr Turner said he only became aware he may have a claim against MGN in May 2020, when Ms Dynevor called him and alerted him to it.

Watch: No final policy on giving votes to EU citizens\n\nLabour is considering extending voting rights to some EU citizens living in the UK if the party wins the next general election.\n\nThe party is working on a package of proposals, including votes for some EU nationals and 16 and 17-year-olds in general elections.\n\nIn 2020, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer called for all EU nationals to be given full voting rights in the UK.\n\nBut Labour said no final policy decisions had been made.\n\nLabour's shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the party's policy on the issue had been the subject of speculation and discussions about this were \"part of our manifesto process\".\n\n\"We do want to strengthen our democracy,\" Mr Reynolds told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. \"We believe if people make a contribution to this country, if they live here, there's an argument for having them involved in [the democratic] process.\"\n\nThe Conservative Party said Labour's plan to give foreign nationals the vote at parliamentary elections \"is laying the groundwork to drag the UK back into the EU by stealth\".\n\n\"The right to vote in parliamentary elections and choose the next UK government is rightly restricted to British citizens and those with the closest historical links to our country,\" Conservative Party Chairman Greg Hands said.\n\nCurrently, EU nationals who are legally resident in the UK can vote in local and devolved elections but not general elections.\n\nA Labour source said the party was thinking about proposals \"that will enable people who live and contribute long-term to our society to be able to have their say in how the country is governed\".\n\nThe source said Sir Keir believes it is \"fair and right\" to give those people a voice in elections.\n\nBut the source said the details of the proposals have not yet been decided, despite suggestions made in newspaper reports by the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThere are an estimated 3.4 million EU nationals with settled status in the UK, and a further 2.7m with pre-settled status.\n\nSettled status allows EU citizen to continue to live, work and study in the UK on an indefinite basis, while pre-settled status is a grant of temporary residence for five years.\n\nThe idea of extending the franchise to more EU nationals in the UK is controversial, with the Conservatives branding such a move \"an attempt to rig the electorate to re-join the EU\".\n\nWhen Sir Keir was running to be Labour leader in 2020, he said the \"government should give all three million EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections\".\n\n\"We were never just 'tolerating' EU citizens living in this country - they are our neighbours, friends and families,\" Sir Keir wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian. \"To see their status in doubt devastates our sense not just of justice but also of fellowship.\"\n\nExtending the franchise to more EU nationals in the UK is a controversial idea\n\nLabour's 2019 manifesto included a commitment to \"oversee the largest extension of the franchise in generations\" by lowering the voting age to 16 and giving \"full voting rights to all UK residents\".\n\nAs the party looks ahead to the next general election, it is deciding what reforms on voting rights to propose in its manifesto.\n\nThe BBC has been told Labour's package of proposals will include the introduction of votes for 16- and 17-year-olds, in line with Scotland and Wales.\n\nAt the moment, 16 and 17-year-olds are allowed to vote in elections for the Scottish and Welsh devolved parliaments, but cannot vote in general elections.\n\nA commitment to lower the voting age to 16 was included in both Labour's 2015 and 2017 manifestos.\n\nThe Greens and the Liberal Democrats also support lowering the voting age.", "A three-day event involving handling mock emergency situations makes up part of the course\n\nFormer soldiers form part of an NHS training scheme aimed at preparing staff for challenges they will face.\n\nBorn of a perceived lack of preparation for Covid, the 10-month Climb programme includes training for unexpected emergencies and hostile environments.\n\nAs the NHS turns 75, bosses said it could survive if \"overwhelming\" problems were overcome.\n\nDr Jonathon Gray of Cardiff and Vale health board said new challenges needed \"different forms of leadership\".\n\nDespite pulling together to open the Dragon's Heart field hospital in the Principality Stadium during the pandemic, those in charge realised their team members were unprepared to deal with the situation.\n\nThe Climb programme culminates in a three-day event with tasks such as co-ordinating a full-scale emergency operation, rescuing bodies from collapsed buildings and dealing with unexpected emergencies.\n\nParticipants are guided through this by members of an international rescue team and former SAS soldiers.\n\nDr Gray, the health board's director of improvement and innovation said the challenges facing NHS staff were \"ever more complex\".\n\nHe added: \"When could possibly be better than the 75th anniversary of the NHS to be investing and growing the young leaders who will create the future NHS?\"\n\nDr Nikki Sommers says \"doing our hardest but still not delivering the best care we'd like\" is really hard for NHS staff\n\nNikki Sommers started her first shift as an A&E consultant at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, Gwynedd, at the start of the first lockdown in 2020.\n\nDespite the unprecedented experiences of that time, Dr Sommers said emergency departments were faced with even bigger challenges today.\n\n\"People's expectations and needs have gone up and we have an ageing population and a system that is totally overwhelmed,\" she said.\n\n\"We're holding ambulances outside now when we never really used to do that. We're treating patients in corridors and that's really distressing for staff and patients.\"\n\nDr Sommers said being part of the programme helped her to assess her priorities and values.\n\nShe said it made her realise that she always wants to work in the NHS because of the importance of delivering free healthcare at the point where it was most needed.\n\nSara Edwards says issues facing the NHS have \"worsened\"\n\nDr Gray added: \"During the pandemic we all faced a huge challenge as everybody knows. We were particularly inspired by the young leaders who ran towards the fire.\n\n\"But we all agreed we'd never really trained those young leaders, or given [them] what they needed to work really well together.\"\n\nSara Edwards, an endoscopy service delivery manager at Hywel Dda health board, was part of the team that built the field hospital.\n\n\"We were a team of people who hadn't worked together before but we were pulled together at short notice to deal with a situation we hadn't been faced with before,\" she said.\n\n\"The NHS had challenges before Covid but they have now worsened to some extent. There's never enough money and we're in a position now where there just aren't enough members of staff trained to care for patients.\n\n\"We really have to think about how we can do things differently and do things better.\"\n\nDr Sherard Lemaitre believes in a future for the NHS if it adapts\n\nDr Sherard Lemaitre, a GP in Cardiff, added: \"I think the NHS does have a future and we all think we're fortunate to have the health service.\n\n\"We need to think about how we can embrace the digital revolution and make sure we don't leave people behind.\"", "Sainsbury's is planning to close two Argos depots over the next three years in a move that will impact more than 1,400 jobs.\n\nThe supermarket giant aims to shut its Argos warehouse in Basildon, Essex, and a depot in Heywood, Greater Manchester by 2026.\n\nBoth Sainsbury's staff and those who work for an outsourced contractor will be affected, it said.\n\nThe firm is integrating its Sainsbury's and Argos operations to cut costs.\n\nThe grocer also said it would close its Milton Keynes office in response to flexible working across the group, but stressed no jobs would be impacted by the decision.\n\nHowever, it also announced that its three remaining Habitat showrooms will close later this year as it plans to launch a replacement digital showroom, which will see a small number of workers affected.\n\nSainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said it was a \"difficult\" decision but the business needed to become \"simpler, more efficient and more effective for customers\".\n\n\"We understand that this will be an unsettling time for affected colleagues, and we will support them however we can throughout this process.\"\n\nThe retailer said affected staff would get the chance to \"explore alternative roles\" within Sainsbury's and Argos.\n\nSainsbury's has been trying to integrate Argos, which it bought along with Habitat for \u00a31.4bn in 2016, with its wider business for several years.\n\nIn 2020 it shut most Argos shops on the High Street and moved 150 of them into its Sainsbury's stores, cutting thousands of jobs in the process.\n\nAs part of the latest plans, Sainsbury's also said that it will close its office in Milton Keynes due to the growth of flexible working since Covid.\n\nIt said \"on average only 11% of available desk space is regularly used by colleagues\".\n\nThe retailer said its decision to launch a digital showroom for Habitat products reflected the fact customers were increasingly shopping online.\n\nThe three remaining Habitat showrooms - in Brighton, Leeds and the Westfield shopping centre in London - will close later this year.\n\nSainsbury's said it was in talks with the \"small number\" of Habitat staff about their options.\n\nLast month, Tesco said more than 2,000 roles were at risk across its business as it announced more changes to the way it runs its supermarkets.\n\nThe grocer plans to cut 1,750 team manager posts across hundreds of its larger

Defence Department documents is a \"very serious\" risk to national security, the Pentagon has said.\n\nThe documents appear to include sensitive information regarding the war in Ukraine, as well as on China and US allies.\n\nOfficials say the files are in a format similar to documents issued to senior leaders.\n\nAn investigation has been opened to determine the source of the leak.\n\nThe documents - some of which officials say may have been altered - first appeared on online platforms such as Twitter, 4chan and Telegram, as well as on a Discord server for the video game Minecraft.\n\nIn addition to highly detailed information about the war in Ukraine, some of the leaked documents are said to cast light on sensitive briefing materials relating to US allies.\n\nA source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN that Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak.\n\nOther documents reportedly focus on defence and security issues in the Middle East as well as in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, a high-ranking Pentagon official said the documents were \"a very serious risk to national security and have the potential to spread disinformation\".\n\n\"We're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue,\" said Chris Meagher, the assistant to the secretary of defence for public affairs.\n\nThe Pentagon is reassessing their process as to who gets access to such sensitive documents.\n\n\"There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed and to whom.\"\n\nMr Meagher declined to answer when asked if the Pentagon believes the documents to be genuine, although he said that some \"appear to have been altered\".\n\nThe justice department is now investigating the leak, alongside officials from the Pentagon, White House and elsewhere in the US government.\n\nThe format of the documents is similar to that \"used to provide daily updates to our senior leaders on Ukraine and Russia-related operations, as well as other intelligence updates\", Mr Meagher added.\n\nThe Pentagon first became aware of the document leak last week, with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin first briefed on the matter on 6 April, he said.\n\nMr Meagher said that the document leak has prompted US officials to reassure its allies \"of our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and fidelity to our security partnerships\".\n\nAt a separate briefing, national security spokesman John Kirby said that US President Joe Biden was first briefed about the leak last week.\n\nWhen asked whether the leak has so far been contained and whether other documents have yet to be released, Mr Kirby said: \"I don't know.\"\n\nBBC News has so far reviewed more than 20 of the documents, many of which appear to detail the deployment and state of Ukrainian and Russian forces ahead of a long-awaited spring offensive by Ukrainian forces.\n\nSome documents, for example, appear to outline US training and equipment being provided to Ukraine ahead of the offensive, as well as when various Ukrainian units will be ready and the anticipated delivery time of military supplies.\n\nWhile Mr Meagher declined to comment on the potential impact that the documents could have on the front lines in Ukraine, he said that \"the Ukrainians have demonstrated their capability and competence in this war\".\n\n\"The president and secretary [of defence] have both made clear that the United States is going to be with them for as

the first time in nearly 40 years after a dramatic last-minute penalty save by James Trafford ensured the Young Lions held on to beat Spain.\n\nTrafford, who is set to join Burnley from Manchester City in a deal that could be worth up to \u00a319m, kept out Abel Ruiz's low spot-kick in the 99th minute after a lengthy VAR check.\n\nThe 20-year-old then produced another brilliant stop on the follow-up before being mobbed by his team-mates.\n\nThe winning goal came with virtually the last kick of the first half when a Cole Palmer free-kick deflected off team-mate Curtis Jones and wrong-footed goalkeeper Arnau Tenas to find the bottom corner.\n\nSpain, who had scored 13 goals in the tournament, had a Ruiz goal ruled out for offside after half-time, before Trafford's late heroics sealed England's victory.\n\nThe win meant Lee Carsley's talented side are the third England team to win the competition after previously picking up the trophy in 1982 and 1984.\n\nThey are also the first team to record six successive clean sheets in the tournament's history.\n\u2022 None Which of England's Euro U21 winners could step up?\n\u2022 None Best action and reaction from

talent.\n\nEngland started the final positively, with Newcastle's Anthony Gordon having the first meaningful chance when his shot was pushed wide by Spain keeper Tenas.\n\nGordon was then involved again as he looked to tee up Morgan Gibbs-White before an interception from Jon Pacheco prevented the Nottingham Forest player from having a tap in.\n\nSpain soon came into the match, with Alex Baena curling an effort past Trafford's post before scuffing another effort wide after he had picked up a loose pass by Gibbs-White.\n\nChelsea defender Levi Colwill headed against the crossbar from an excellent delivery from Palmer, before the Manchester City man gave England the lead when his free-kick was deflected in by Liverpool's Jones.\n\nThe half ended with bad blood as Palmer's celebration led to a melee between both benches, which resulted in England coach Ashley Cole and Spanish fitness coach Carlos Rivera being sent to the stands.\n\nEngland were under immense pressure during the second period, and it looked to have paid off for Spain when Ruiz headed in from a Baena cross, only for the offside flag to go up. Ruiz had another chance to equalise, but headed wide from inside the six-yard box.\n\nThe match ended in dramatic style when Colwill - so highly rated by England's staff following his week training with the senior team - was judged to have fouled Ruiz in the box.\n\nTrafford got down well to save the resulting penalty and an immediate follow-up to give England victory and spark scenes of jubilation.\n\nThe bad blood continued, however, with nine yellow and four red cards handed out by the final whistle, as Gibbs-White and Antonio Blanco were both sent off in the final throes.\n\nNow that England have won the trophy, the discussions will start about which of these young stars will be knocking on the door of the senior squad and be in with a chance of playing in the senior European Championships next summer.\n\nTrafford, who is on the brink of becoming the third-most expensive English goalkeeper ever, will rightly take the headlines for his heroic double save in the last minute of added time of the final.\n\nHowever, that moment just capped off what had already been a superb tournament, having been a standout player in this team from the very first game.\n\nTrafford has shown he is the very definition of a modern-day goalkeeper - comfortable with the ball at his feet, dominant when coming for crosses and making eye-catching saves when called upon.\n\nHe also has immense self belief, telling people that he would one day play for England while he was on loan at Accrington Stanley.\n\nDuring this competition he has spoken about his desire to play at the highest level and he will now get the chance next season when he becomes a Premier League number one at Turf Moor.\n\u2022 None Attempt missed.

A lovely man. May he rest in peace.\"\n\nBroadcaster Piers Morgan described Springer as a \"TV icon and such an intelligent, warm, funny man\".\n\n\"Loved working with him on AGT [America's Got Talent], loved hanging out with him (we lived in same hotel for two years), loved arguing with him (he loved his politics), loved everything about him,\" he added.\n\nSpringer was born in the London Underground station of Highgate in 1944 in World War Two.\n\nHis parents, who were Jewish refugees from a region of Germany which is now part of Poland, were in the station sheltering from a German bombing raid at the time.\n\nSpringer moved to Queens, New York, aged four, along with his parents and older sister.\n\nHe started his professional life working in politics, having studied both political science and law at university.\n\nHe was an advisor to Robert F Kennedy, and served as mayor of Cincinnati from 1977-78, but after a failed bid to become governor of Ohio he switched to a career in TV journalism.\n\nHe became a reporter at a local TV station and worked his way up to being an anchor.\n\nLaunched in 1991, The Jerry Springer Show began life as an ordinary talk show focusing on social issues and US politics, led by the-then mild mannered Springer.\n\nBut in an effort to boost ratings, Springer switched things up dramatically after a few years, focusing on salacious and outrageous content.\n\nSpringer repeatedly defended his show against accusations it was too low-brow.\n\nHe told the BBC in 2014: \"You could decide only to put well-scrubbed, wealthy people who speak the Queen's English on television and just do that but that wouldn't reflect the whole society.\"\n\n\"If all shows were like mine, that would be wrong. But you can't just have television that is like Friends, Seinfeld, all these wealthy people, good looking people and you love it,\" he added.\n\n\"If some wealthy, famous person goes on television and talks about who he or she has been sleeping with, we can't get enough of it. We cheer them. But if it's some person of low income, all of a sudden we say trash.\"\n\nIn most episodes, guests came to talk about family problems and expose adultery and other transgressions.\n\nSpringer would supposedly try to mediate but the encounters often ended up in fist-fights, with guests being held back by security guards.\n\nThe audience would regularly chant \"Jerry! Jerry!\" when tensions became heightened during the episodes.\n\nOn his Twitter profile, Springer jokingly declared himself as \"talk show host, ringmaster of civilisation's end\".\n\nSpringer called his programme \"escapist entertainment\", but others saw the show as contributing to a dumbing-down of television and a decline in social values.\n\nHe often jokingly told people he met that his wish for them was: \"May you never be on my show.\"\n\nOn his Twitter profile, Springer jokingly declared himself as \"talk show host, ringmaster of civilisation's end\"\n\nIn the late 1990s the show topped the daytime television ratings in the US, beating even Oprah.

Jerry Springer: The Opera ran for 609 performances in London from April 2003 to February 2005 before touring the UK in 2006.\n\nIt won four Olivier awards including best new musical. In January 2005, its UK television broadcast on BBC Two attracted 55,000 complaints.\n\nJerry Springer: The Opera provoked accusations of blasphemy and protests from religious campaigners. But broadcast regulator Ofcom said it did not breach its guidelines.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2008, Springer hosted America's Got Talent, and in recent years he fronted the courtroom show Judge Jerry.\n\nIn June 2009, Springer made his stage debut as Billy Flynn in Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre, London.\n\nSpringer also appeared on the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? programme, tracing his family through the Holocaust to the small town of Neustettin, which is now in Poland.\n\nIn October, Springer starred in the US version of The Masked Singer - one of his final TV appearances.\n\nHe had stepped down from The Jerry Springer Podcast, after eight years, in December.\n\nPolitical commentator David Axelrod tweeted: \"Jerry Springer will be remembered as the ringmaster of an embarrassing, tabloid-style TV show.\n\n\"But I met him earlier, when he was a mayor and insurgent progressive candidate for governor of Ohio in a race I covered.

His supporters have condemned the trial as \"manifestly unfair\".\n\nThe Rue Copernic attack was the first to target Jews in France since World War Two, and became a template for many other similar attacks linked to militants in the Middle East in the years that followed.\n\nThe decades-long investigation became a byword both for protracted judicial confusion, as well as for the dogged determination of a handful of magistrates not to let the case be forgotten.\n\nDiab is a Lebanese of Palestinian origin who obtained Canadian nationality in 1993 and teaches sociology in Ottawa.\n\nHe was first named as a suspect on the basis of new evidence in 1999, already nearly 20 years after the killings.\n\nHassan Diab denied involvement in the bombing and refused to leave Canada to attend the trial\n\nEight years later the French issued an international arrest warrant, and it was not until 2014 that Canada agreed to extradite. But in 2018 French magistrates declared the case closed for lack of proof, allowing Diab to return to Canada.\n\nFinally in 2021 an appeal against the closure of the case was upheld in the Supreme Court, the first time this had ever happened in a French terrorism case.\n\nIt meant a trial could finally go ahead, and it began earlier this month.\n\nFrom the start Diab, protested his innocence and he did not return to France for the trial, which was conducted in his absence. His conviction means that a second extradition request will have to follow, though with strong doubts over whether it will succeed.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Press news agency, Diab said on Friday that \"we hoped reason would prevail\".\n\nResponding to the verdict, the Hassan Diab Support Committee in Canada called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to make it \"absolutely clear\" that no second extradition would be accepted.\n\nThey said 15 years of legal \"nightmare... is now fully exposed in its overwhelming cruelty and injustice\".\n\nAt a news conference, Mr Trudeau said his government \"will look carefully at next steps, at what the French government chooses to do, at what French tribunals choose to do\".\n\n\"But we will always be there to stand up for Canadians and their rights,\" he added.\n\nOver three weeks the court heard an account of the known facts of the case, plus arguments identifying Diab as the bomber and counter-evidence suggesting he was a victim of mistaken identity.\n\nPolice released an artist's impression of the bomber in 1980\n\nNone of the original investigating team was alive to speak, and the surviving witnesses who saw the attacker in 1980 all admitted that after more than 40 years their memories were too hazy to be reliable.\n\nThe bomb was left in the saddle-bag of a Suzuki motorbike outside a synagogue in the wealthy 16th arrondissement of Paris. Had there not been a delay, the pavement would have been packed with people leaving the religious service inside.\n\nIn 1980 the investigation initially centred on neo-Nazis, and there were mass demonstrations by the political left. But a claim by an ultra-right group was found to be fake, and by the end of the year attention had switched to a Middle East connection.\n\nThe bomber was identified as having a fake Cypriot passport bearing the name Alexander Panadriyu.\n\nHe was believed to have entered France from another European country as part of a larger group, and to have bought the motorbike at a shop near the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nHe was thought to belong to a dissident Palestinian group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-Special Operations (PFLP-SO).\n\nBut the investigation hit a wall, and it was not till 1999 that Hassan Diab's name emerged from new information, believed to emanate from the former Soviet bloc.\n\nThe attack was eventually blamed on a dissident Palestinian group - the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-Special Operations\n\nItalian authorities then revealed that in 1981 the passport of a Hassan Diab had been found at Rome airport in the possession of a senior figure from the PFLP-SO. The passport bore stamps showing the holder entering and leaving Spain around the dates of the Rue Copernic attack.\n\nThe core of the prosecution case rested on the passport.\n\nUnder questioning while in custody, Diab explained that he had lost the passport just a month before the attack. But in Lebanon a French judge found an official declaration for the lost passport - a declaration made in 1983 and with a date of loss in April 1981.\n\nThe defence argued that all of this was circumstantial, and that there was still no hard evidence that Diab was in France in October 1980. They produced testimony from friends in Beirut who said Diab had been sitting university exams at the time of the attack.\n\nHandwriting analysts who said the hotel registration form signed by the attacker was consistent with Diab's script were also dismissed as inconclusive.\n\n\"The only decision that is juridically possible - even if it's on a human level a difficult one - is acquittal,\" defence lawyer William Bourdon said in his summing-up Thursday. \"I am here before you to prevent a judicial error.\"\n\nBut prosecutor Benjamin Chambre, while regretting that all the other members of the terrorist group had escaped without charge, said: \"With Hassan Diab, we have the bomb-maker and the bomb-planter.

After being approached by Donnelly, Aidan crossed the road and started running along Church Street, still wearing a motorcycle helmet and being chased by him.\n\nThe fatal stabbing happened on Church Street in Downpatrick\n\nThe chase continued and, at one point, Aidan turned round, looked back at Donnelly and appeared to gesture at him before he crossed the road into oncoming traffic.\n\nThe CCTV footage then showed Donnelly catching up with Aidan on the pavement outside a car dealership.\n\nAfter Aidan fell to the ground, Donnelly straddled his victim, who he stabbed repeatedly in the chest, leg and torso.\n\nMembers of the public intervened, pulled Donnelly off Aidan and called 999. He was arrested while still being restrained by the public.\n\nTwo large kitchen knives used by Donnelly were seized from the scene.\n\nA prosecutor at an earlier hearing said that at the scene Donnelly shouted it was a revenge attack for his brother who had been murdered the previous evening, which the lawyer said \"transpired to be completely wrong\".\n\nDonnelly was admitted to a psychiatric unit - the Shannon clinic - in the month after the killing where he remains.\n\nTwo consultant psychiatrists agreed that the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning arising from schizophrenia at the time of the attack.\n\nA psychiatrist indicated that he would probably not need to remain for treatment much longer and envisaged him moving to prison.\n\nDonnelly's defence barrister told the court that his client had not been aware that he was suffering from acute mental illness until after the \"terrible act\" in which Aidan died.\n\nHe said his client has expressed \"regret, remorse and heartbreak\".\n\nDet Insp Foreman said said the \"senseless\" attack had happened in the late morning, \"when members of the public were going about their business\".\n\nThe detective thanked those who ran to Aidan's assistance and who phoned emergency services.\n\n\"There are no words that can undo the tragic events of that morning,\" Det Insp Foreman added.\n\n\"There's nothing that can ease the pain and sadness of those who knew and loved Aidan, and my thoughts are very much with them today.\"\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Sport has paid tribute to King Charles III on the day of his coronation.\n\nPlayers lined up as the national anthem was played before football and cricket matches throughout the country.\n\nSimilar tributes were also held before Saturday's final round of games in the rugby union Premiership, which were put back to a 16:00 BST start so fans could enjoy the celebrations.\n\nThe tributes were not universal as many Liverpool fans booed the anthem before their home game against Brentford.\n\nAs both teams lined up around the centre circle for 'God Save The King' to be played, a large part of Anfield began booing before breaking into chants of \"Liverpool\".\n\nElsewhere, there were special ceremonies held at the Newmarket horse race meeting, as well as at the Badminton Horse Trials.\n\nFootball's tribute to King Charles III started with Friday's Women's Super League match between Arsenal and Leicester at Boreham Wood, when players surrounded the centre circle to observe the national anthem.\n\nOn Saturday, Chelsea forward Sam Kerr, an Australian international, was chosen to carry her country's flag to lead the Australian delegation as they made their way into Westminster Abbey in London before the coronation ceremony.\n\nThe national anthem was later observed before four Premier League matches that kicked off at 15:00, which included Manchester City v Leeds, Bournemouth v Chelsea, Tottenham v Crystal Palace and Wolves v Aston Villa.\n\nManchester City's game at Etihad Stadium had originally been planned for an early televised kick-off but was moved to avoid a clash with the coronation ceremony after the Premier League agreed to relax broadcast blackout rules.\n\nLiverpool played the national anthem before their 17:30 kick-off against Brentford, despite the club saying they know some fans \"have strong views on it\".\n\nA section of the club's support booed 'Abide With Me' and 'God Save The Queen' before last season's FA Cup final, while anti-coronation songs were heard during Wednesday's win over Fulham at Anfield.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who had wished \"King Charles III well, not just today but also for the future,\" in his programme notes, said: \"We have freedom of speech.

part of the agreement.\n\nThe final decision to set up the new organisation is expected to be approved at a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe BB in Northern Ireland originally decided to become a separate body in 2022.\n\nThe split with the BB in the UK and Ireland is due to differences over finance, governance and some \"cultural differences\" on faith matters.\n\nWith about 11,000 boys and 2,500

the second such cut this year.\n\nIt is worth about \u00a3450 a year to an employee on an average salary of \u00a335,000.\n\nBut a freeze in income levels at which tax is paid until 2028 will leave many with a higher income tax bill.\n\nMany benefits are rising in line with prices, and the state pension is also set to increase. But this comes after a slew of household bills became more expensive at the start of the month.\n\nSo, the financial impact can differ significantly - depending on whether people work, how much they earn, and other personal circumstances.\n\nA fixed percentage of the money people earn from their wages is deducted in NI.\n\nSince 6 January, millions of employees have been paying 10% on their earnings between \u00a312,571 and \u00a350,270. They previously paid 12%. From Saturday, they will be paying 8%.\n\nYour device may not support this calculator\n\nAmong those who have welcomed the cut is part-time teacher Beth Langton-Clarke, who said the money could help to pay for a family holiday.\n\n\"It has been tough,\" she said. \"But this will make a big difference.\"\n\nShe said the family finances could be improved by about \u00a3800 a year as a result of the change.\n\nMrs Langton-Clarke says finances have been stretched\n\nBut she said it had come after they had cut back on spending - particularly food - and constantly telling the children they would be going on fewer outings owing to rising costs.\n\n\"It would be nice to put some money into savings again. It has been a while,\" she said.\n\nFor the self-employed, NI contributions on all earnings between \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270 are being cut from a rate of 9% to 6%.\n\nPensioners will not benefit from the reduction, because those over state pension age do not pay NI. However, from Monday, the state pension will go up by 8.5%.\n\nSome pensioners, and families like the Langton-Clarkes, are not simply receiving a tax boost. That is because of the continued freeze on income tax thresholds - a factor known as fiscal drag.\n\nThe start of April would normally see the income thresholds at which different bands of tax are paid going up in line with prices.\n\nHowever, government policy means this has not happened with income tax since 2021 and, under current plans, the freeze will continue until 2028.\n\nThe result is more people paying tax and more people paying higher rates of tax than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nCombining the impact of the thresholds freezes and the NI cuts, independent think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that for every \u00a31 given back to workers (including the self-employed) this year by the NI cuts, \u00a31.30 will have been taken away due to the threshold changes between 2021 and 2024, with this rising to \u00a31.90 in 2027.\n\nThere are winners and losers from the tax changes. The average earner on about \u00a335,000 has benefitted more from the cut in NI than the hit from frozen tax thresholds.\n\nHowever, the very top earners have seen their taxes rise owing to changes in tax policy.\n\nMeanwhile, fiscal drag - as well as rising minimum pay rates - mean somebody working 35 hours a week on the minimum wage is now having to pay tax on almost \u00a38,300 of their earnings. Last year it would have been \u00a36,400.\n\nSimilarly, it is estimated that 1.6 million pensioners will be drawn into paying tax by 2027-28.\n\nScotland has different tax bands to the rest of the UK.\n\nA range of benefits received by millions of people, such as universal credit, are rising by 6.7%, in line with the rate of rising prices (as of September).\n\nBenefits are fully devolved in Northern Ireland, but changes will be similar to those for the rest of the UK.", "Government borrowing costs - which directly impact mortgage rates - have risen to their highest rate since last September when the Liz Truss mini-budget sparked days of turmoil on the financial markets.\n\nThe market interest rate for the UK government to borrow money over two years is now effectively higher than it reached in the aftermath of that mini-budget. It is also the highest level for a decade and a half and now clearly higher than seen for the US government.\n\nThe fact that this is not the same market panic as last autumn will come as little respite to many people renewing their mortgages.\n\nAll this reflects market expectations that the UK has a specific problem with stubborn and sticky inflation that will require higher interest rates for longer. Some market bets now see a half percentage point rate rise next week, and rates settling closer to 6% than 5% at the end of the year.\n\nThere is an important difference to the mini-budget aftermath. The moves are being seen mainly in short-term rates. The real problem last autumn was for longer term 10- and 30-year borrowing, which saw significant moves in yields, the result of a loss of market confidence in the then government's tax and spend plans. Current rates for such long-term borrowing are still well below that market panic.\n\nToday's move is more like a steady squeeze as the markets come to terms with the idea of the Bank of England keeping rates higher for longer had been expected, and above rates seen in similar economies.\n\nIt will be no less problematic for some homeowners. The two-year rate forms the floor for two-year fixed-rate mortgage borrowing. There has been a deluge of mortgage repricing, with particular pressure on landlords. This comes as a hump of two-year mortgage deals from 2021 - at the time of the expiry of the pandemic stamp duty holiday - come up for renewal at much higher rates.", "NIE Networks is to invest over \u00a33bn in Northern Ireland's electricity network over the next 10 years in order to facilitate climate change targets.\n\nIt also plans to create more than 1,000 jobs between now and 2032 in an attempt to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nNIE Networks said the investment would help its 910,000 customers connect to low-carbon technologies like electric cars, solar panels and heat pumps.\n\nBut it will mean an additional cost to customers of about \u00a310 to \u00a320 a year.\n\nNIE Networks owns the network of lines, poles and substations that takes electricity from power stations to homes and businesses.\n\nIt does not generate electricity, nor does it sell power to consumers.\n\nIts managing director Derek Hynes said a \"significant step change\" was needed in the level of investment to \"facilitate the scale of decarbonisation\" required as a result of new climate change law.\n\n\"We believe that we will need to create 1,000 new jobs, including 400 apprenticeships in NIE Networks and up to 500 new jobs in our contractors and support partners, between now and 2030,\" he said.\n\nMr Hynes added that it was important to be \"transparent with our customers\" about an increase in network charges of about \u00a310 to \u00a320 per year, but that it was \"critical we invest now to avoid higher costs in the future\".\n\nThe Centre of Advanced Sustainable Energy (Case) said Northern Ireland's targets for dealing with climate change were \"ambitious\" but could not be met without major investment in energy infrastructure.\n\n\"In the long-term, we would see many benefits being realised through this investment,\" said Martin Doherty from Case.\n\n\"Alongside the positive economic impact on the supply chain and wider industry, this will go a long way to enabling Northern Ireland to meet the target of 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030 which, in turn, could ease the pressure on energy bills.\"\n\nDetails of the investment are part of NIE Networks' business plan, which was submitted in March to the Utility Regulator.\n\nThe regulator will assess it and publish a draft determination for public consultation in November.\n\nThe regulator is expected to publish a final determination and proposals on licence modifications in October 2024.", "Last updated on .From the section Premier League\n\nPremier League clubs have collectively agreed to withdraw gambling sponsorship from the front of their matchday shirts by the end of the 2025-26 season.\n\nHowever, after the deadline, clubs will still be able to continue featuring gambling brands in areas such as shirt sleeves and LED advertising.\n\nAnd clubs will be allowed to secure new shirt-front deals before the deadline.\n\nEight top-flight clubs have gambling companies on the front of their shirts, worth an estimated \u00a360m per year.\n\nThe announcement follows a consultation between the league, its clubs and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as part of the government's ongoing review of current gambling legislation.\n\nThe decision will see the Premier League become the first sports league in the UK to take such a measure voluntarily in order to reduce gambling advertising.\n\u2022 None 'No plans' for SPFL ban on gambling sponsors\n\u2022 None Listen - The Sports Desk podcast: Is it time for football to cut ties with gambling?\n\nThe league is also working with other sports on the development of a new code for responsible gambling sponsorship.\n\nThe government was not expected to propose banning gambling sponsorship, with the plan being for the Premier League to agree voluntarily to a change.\n\nReforms to the Gambling Act 2005 were largely agreed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson before he stepped down last July, leading to a delay in a gambling white paper being published.\n\nOn Thursday, Lucy Frazer, who was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in February, said she \"welcomed the decision by the Premier League\".\n\n\"The vast majority of adults gamble safely but we have to recognise that footballers are role models who have enormous influence on young people,\" she added.\n\n\"We want to work with institutions like the Premier League to do the right thing for young fans. We will soon bring forward a gambling white paper to update protections for punters and ensure those who are at risk of gambling harm and addiction are protected.\"\n\nWhat is the background?\n\nA DCMS spokesperson told BBC Sport last May that they are undertaking \"the most comprehensive review of gambling laws in 15 years to make sure they are fit for the digital age\".\n\nCampaigners for a wider ban say gambling sponsorship in football has normalised the industry, and that tighter regulation is needed to protect children and other vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Betting and Gambling Council, which represents the industry, said the \"overwhelming majority\" of the 22.5m people in the UK who bet each month, do so \"safely and responsibly\".\n\nIt added the \"rate of problem gambling remains low by international standards at 0.3% of the UK's adult population - down from 0.4% the year previous\".\n\nHowever, a YouGov survey for GambleAware in 2021 put the figure at 2.8%.\n\nFormer Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith is part of the All Party Parliamentary Group on gambling-related harm, which has been lobbying the government for tougher protections.\n\nHe said: \"At the moment, we are probably the country with the most liberal gambling laws in the world.\"\n\u2022 None Who are the betting firms sponsoring your team?\n\nIn January, Aston Villa's fan consultation group met chief executive Christian Purslow after the club was reported to have signed a deal with Asia-based betting firm BK8. It later issued a statement saying \"the commercial reality is that to teams outside the top six, such sponsors offer clubs twice as much financially as non-gambling companies\".\n\nThe Premier League has previously said \"a self-regulatory approach would provide a practical and flexible alternative to legislation or outright prohibition\".\n\nThe collective agreement to start the ban after 2025-26 has been reached to assist clubs with their transition away from shirt-front gambling sponsorship.\n\nThe English Football League (EFL), which is sponsored by Sky Bet, has previously said any outright gambling sponsorship ban for its 72 members would cost clubs \u00a340m a year.\n\nThe EFL's position on the gambling industry is long standing, that it should contribute to the financial sustainability of professional football, considering the significant amount of money it makes from the game.\n\nChairman Rick Parry has previously expressed the EFL's belief that an evidence-based approach to preventing harms is of much greater benefit than that of a blanket ban.\n\n'Although this outcome isn't perfect, it's a huge step'\n\nLast summer Premier League club Everton confirmed they had agreed a club-record, multi-year partnership with casino and sports betting platform Stake.com.\n\nAfter the league's agreement was announced on Thursday, Everton's current manager Sean Dyche said: \"I am not going to get too involved in the debates of judging about it but they have made a collective decision and all parties have agreed with that.\"\n\nAccording to The Big Step, a campaign to end gambling advertising and sponsorship in football, just over three years ago nearly 30 clubs in the Premier League and the Championship had a gambling company on the front of their shirt.\n\n\"With today's announcement, we are getting closer to when that will be 0,\" said The Big Step in a statement. \"It is a significant acceptance of the harm caused by gambling sponsorship.\n\n\"But just moving logos to a different part of the kit while allowing pitch-side advertising and league sponsorship to continue is totally incoherent.\n\n\"Without government action on all forms of gambling ads in football, at every level, online casinos will exploit any voluntary measures and continue to market their products through our national sport.\n\n\"Although this outcome isn't perfect, it's a huge step. The government and the sport itself now need to wake up to the reality that gambling ads are unhealthy, unpopular and will be kicked out of football. Delaying that moment is risking the health and lives of another generation of young fans.\"\n\nGambling with Lives, a community of families bereaved by gambling-related suicide, said the announcement was \"not perfect by any means, but a welcome move and significant acceptance of the harm caused by gambling advertising and sponsorship\".\n\n'A total ban had always looked unlikely'\n\nThe news of this voluntary ban doesn't go far enough for some campaigners. They point out the influence that the Premier League has on children and young people and argue gambling sponsorship of football is a key part of the process to normalise the industry (as they see it).\n\nEven after 2026, gambling company names will still be on the banner advertising around the grounds and on the sleeves of adult shirts.\n\nMany had wanted a total ban on this kind of sponsorship and advertising in football.

She said the branch was \"too OK\" with a toxic culture of racism and sexism.\n\n\"Having a culture like that in such a big company is not OK,\" said Liv.\n\nShe alleges that the manager was not disciplined, and his behaviour did not improve. Eventually she quit.\n\nHer father Steve said the lack of empathy from staff for his daughter was \"heart-breaking\".\n\nLinda, not her real name, is a current employee at a McDonald's branch in Wales.\n\nShe says she has complained about a significantly older male colleague repeatedly attempting to follow her into the toilet. She alleges he has repeatedly made sexual comments about her over the last two years, since she was 16.\n\nAfter reporting his behaviour to two managers, she was told to ignore him, and the male colleague still works with her.\n\nMany staff, former staff and parents of staff have come forward to allege not only a toxic culture but some serious incidents including sexual harassment, assault and bullying.\n\nThe BBC has verified that the people speaking out have worked for McDonald's.\n\nClaire Brook, an employment law solicitor at Aaron & Partners, said that even though McDonald's is a franchise model and not employing the staff in question directly, it was \"still very much an HR and reputational crisis for the brand\".\n\n\"These very many serious allegations and reports are a stark reminder of the consequences of failing to create an appropriate work environment, which has its added challenges for large, multi-site franchise models,\" she said.\n\nAlistair Macrow, chief executive of McDonald's UK & Ireland, said the allegations were \"deeply distressing\" and that he appreciated \"the bravery it will have taken the people in question\" who have come forward.\n\n\"We ask anyone who has experienced or witnessed any inappropriate behaviour to contact our confidential and independently operated Business Integrity Line, if you feel able to,\" he said.\n\nEvery one of the 177,000 employees in McDonald's UK deserved to work in a \"safe, respectful and inclusive workplace\" he added.\n\n\"There are clearly instances where we have fallen short and for that we deeply apologise.\"\n\n\"There is simply no place for harassment, abuse, or discrimination of any kind at McDonald's.\"\n\nThe number for the hotline is: 0800 0903674", "Hundreds of students have been impacted by a marking boycott\n\nQueen's University Belfast (QUB) has been suspended from membership of the umbrella body for university employers.\n\nThe Universities and Colleges Employers' Association (UCEA) said it had taken the action because QUB had made a local agreement on pay.\n\nIn June, Queen's and the University and College Union (UCU) reached agreement to end a marking boycott by some staff.\n\nMore than 750 students at QUB graduated without having their degree results finally confirmed due to the boycott.\n\nThe university said an additional full graduation ceremony for them would take place at a later date yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe settlement between the university and the UCU at Queen's was the first of its kind across the UK.\n\nThe agreement included a cost-of-living supplement equivalent to 2% of pay for all QUB staff except those on the senior salary scheme.\n\nMany universities across the UK have also been affected by the union's marking and assessment boycott, which is part of a long-running dispute over pay and workload.\n\nThe UCEA conducts pay negotiations with trade unions on behalf of over 140 universities and colleges across the UK.\n\nBut in a statement the UCEA said that Queen's had made a local agreement on staff pay \"outside of the collective pay arrangements\" for 2023-24 to settle the marking boycott.\n\n\"The UCEA Board has now had a chance to consider the representations from QUB and has concluded that this an extremely serious matter and that the actions of QUB are incompatible with continued membership of UCEA,\" it said.\n\n\"Accordingly, the board has informed QUB of its decision to terminate their UCEA membership for a period of three years in the first instance.\"\n\nThe industrial action by staff at Queen's University had lasted for months\n\nIn a statement in response, Queen's defended its decision to make a local arrangement with the UCU to settle the marking boycott.\n\n\"Our focus has always placed our students first,\" the QUB statement said.\n\n\"In the absence of any progress being made nationally regarding the industrial action, the local arrangement between Queen's branch of UCU and the University allowed us to conduct 22 graduation ceremonies for our students.\n\n\"It has also enabled us to provide students awaiting their degree classifications with certainty as to when they will be received.\n\n\"We remain convinced that this local arrangement was the correct and most appropriate course of action for our university and our students.\"\n\nBBC News NI understands the university's suspension from the UCEA means it may be able to set its own pay policy for staff and make its own pay offer.\n\nHowever, that has not yet been confirmed.", "The UK is sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv to aid Ukrainians in the fight against Russia\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said Russia would be \"forced to react\" if the UK sent shells made with depleted uranium to Ukraine.\n\nHe accused the West of deploying weapons with a \"nuclear component\".\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence confirmed it would provide Kyiv the armour-piercing rounds alongside Challenger 2 tanks but insisted they had a low radiation risk.\n\nDepleted uranium \"is a standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons\", the MoD said.\n\n\"The British Army has used depleted uranium in its armour piercing shells for decades,\" the statement added.\n\n\"Russia knows this, but is deliberately trying to disinform. Independent research by scientists from groups such as the Royal Society has assessed that any impact to personal health and the environment from the use of depleted uranium munitions is likely to be low.\"\n\nFormer British Army tank commander - and chemical weapons expert - Col Hamish de Breton-Gordon, said Mr Putin's comments were \"classic disinformation\".\n\nHe said depleted uranium rounds used by Challenger 2 tanks contained only trace elements of depleted uranium.\n\nHe added it was \"laughable\" to suggest depleted uranium rounds were in any way linked to nuclear weapons, which uses enriched uranium.\n\nDepleted uranium is what is left over after natural uranium has been enriched, either for weapons-making or for reactor fuel.\n\nIt is mildly radioactive in its solid form. But it is a very heavy substance, 1.7 times denser than lead, and it is used to harden rounds so that they can penetrate armour and steel.\n\nWhen a weapon made with a depleted uranium tip or core strikes a solid object, like the side of a tank, it goes straight through it and then erupts in a burning cloud of vapour.\n\nThe vapour settles as dust, which is poisonous and also weakly radioactive.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sending depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine would mean the UK was \"ready to violate international humanitarian law as in 1999 in Yugoslavia\".\n\n\"There is no doubt this will end badly for London,\" Mr Lavrov added.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a spokesman for the Pentagon said the US would not be sending any munitions with depleted uranium to Ukraine.\n\nShells with depleted uranium were used in Iraq and the Balkans, where some claim it was linked to birth defects.\n\nA 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report said depleted uranium was an environmental concern in Ukraine.\n\n\"Depleted uranium and toxic substances in common explosives can cause skin irritation, kidney failure and increase the risks of cancer,\" it said.\n\n\"The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,\" it added.", "Phillip Schofield left his role on This Morning last week following reports of a rift with Holly Willoughby\n\nPhillip Schofield has quit ITV after admitting he had an affair with a younger male ITV employee and lied to cover it up.\n\nThe ex-This Morning host said the relationship with his junior colleague was \"unwise but not illegal\".\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail, Schofield said he \"met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television\".\n\nHe apologised for lying to colleagues, employers, the media and public.\n\nAn ITV spokesperson said they were \"deeply disappointed by the admissions of deceit\" made by Schofield and confirmed it had cut all ties with the host.\n\nIt means the 61-year-old will no longer present the British Soap Awards next month.\n\nHe will also not front a new prime-time series which ITV had said last week they were developing with him.\n\nSchofield left his role at This Morning last week after reports of a rift with co-star Holly Willoughby.\n\nHe said his departure from the show was unrelated to the affair with the colleague, who the BBC is not naming.\n\nThe TV presenter was still married to his wife Stephanie Lowe at the time of the relationship. They separated in 2020, after Schofield came out as gay.\n\nSchofield said he was \"so, very, very sorry\" for being unfaithful to his wife, and for lying to his colleagues, agents, employers, friends, the media and the public.\n\nSchofield said he was \"so, very, very sorry\" for being unfaithful to his wife Stephanie Lowe (pictured in 2017)\n\nThe TV host said he would reflect on his \"very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it\".\n\nAn ITV spokesperson said: \"The relationships we have with those we work with are based on trust.\n\n\"Phillip made assurances to us which he now acknowledges were untrue and we feel badly let down.\"\n\nHis announcement follows significant online speculation over several months about Schofield's personal relationships.\n\nTalent agency YMU has also cut ties with Schofield following his announcement about the affair.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the TV presenter said: \"It is with the most profound regret that after 35 years of being faultlessly managed by YMU I have agreed to step down from their representation with immediate effect.\"\n\nSome former ITV daytime figures, including Eamonn Holmes and Dan Wootton, have suggested the network has questions to answer about how much managers knew about the relationship and what action they took.\n\n\"I am making this statement via the Daily Mail to whom I have already apologised personally for misleading, through my lawyer who I also misled, about a story which they wanted to write about me a few days ago.\n\n\"The first thing I want to say is: I am deeply sorry for having lied to them, and to many others about a relationship that I had with someone working on This Morning. I did have a consensual on-off relationship with a younger male colleague at This Morning.\n\n\"Contrary to speculation, whilst I met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television, it was only after he started to work on the show that it became more than just a friendship. That relationship was unwise, but not illegal. It is now over.\n\n\"When I chose to come out I did so entirely for my own wellbeing. Nobody 'forced' me out.

I am so very, very sorry, as I am for having been unfaithful to my wife.\n\n\"I have therefore decided to step down from the British Soap Awards, my last public commitment, and am resigning from ITV with immediate effect expressing my immense gratitude to them for all the amazing opportunities that they have given me.\n\n\"I will reflect on my very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it.\n\n\"To protect his privacy, I am not naming this individual and my deepest wish is that both he and his family can now move on with their lives free from further intrusion, and that this statement will enable them to do so.\n\n\"I ask the media now to respect their privacy. They have done nothing wrong, and I ask that their privacy should be respected.\"\n\nSchofield's final appearance on This Morning was on Thursday 18 May.

young people by and large growing up separately,\" it concluded.\n\nPeter Osborne said he thought the report's estimated cost of division and duplication of services in education was \"a little bit conservative\"\n\n\"Societal divisions persist and continue to cost our economy, define our confrontational politics and blight the lives of many of the people who live here.\n\n\"These costs can also be seen in our education system, where division, separation and duplication all add unnecessary and increasingly unaffordable costs.\n\n\"Consequently, funding which could be spent directly on educating children and young people is wasted.\n\n\"The question is not 'can we afford to address this?'\n\n\"Instead, it should be 'can we really afford not to?'\"\n\nThere are significant pressures on Northern Ireland's education budget.\n\nFor instance, a scheme to give payments to the families of 96,000 children entitled to free school meals over the school holidays was recently axed to save money.", "Ukraine's then-president described Tony Blair as a \"sincere friend\" of his country in the archived documents\n\nTony Blair was urged to back Ukraine's dream to join the EU to form a barrier against Russian threats, newly released records from his time as PM show.\n\nHis special Europe adviser told him Kyiv wanted a \"special relationship... if only we would show more interest,\" the National Archives reveal.\n\nUkraine's then-president, Leonid Kuchma, also wrote to Mr Blair appealing for his support.\n\nBut Nato has refused to give Kyiv a timeline for membership.\n\nAccording to the documents dating back more than 20 years, Mr Kuchma appealed directly to then-prime minister Mr Blair to back Ukraine's long-term goal of \"full-scale European and Euro-Atlantic integration, including the full-fledged EU membership\".\n\nIt had been barely a decade since Ukraine gained independence in 1991 and President Kuchma, in power since 1994, added in a handwritten note that he pinned great hopes on Mr Blair, as a \"sincere friend\" of Ukraine... on your personal support in this exceptionally important issue\".\n\nMr Kuchma had first declared Ukraine's intention to join the EU in 1998, but there was little enthusiasm for it in Germany or France. One of the biggest stumbling blocks was that Ukraine was beset with corruption and its businesses run by powerful oligarchs.\n\nFor all his Western leanings, Mr Kuchma's own government was tainted by the gruesome 2000 murder of a journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, who was one of the Ukrainian leader's biggest public critics. Mr Kuchma has always denied complicity in his death.\n\nAccording to the newly released documents, Roger Liddle, who served as an adviser to Mr Blair on European affairs, said immediate EU or Nato membership was unlikely but he urged the prime minister to become more engaged.\n\nAfter July 2001 talks in Crimea, 13 years before it was seized by Russia, he wrote to the prime minister: \"Strengthening Ukraine's shaky democracy and economy increases stability on the EU's future eastern borders and acts as a formidable barrier to any resurgence of Russian imperialism to the West.\"\n\nBy December 2001, after a Ukrainian delegation had taken part in talks in the UK, Mr Liddle said the Ukrainians were \"depressed... that most of Europe and the new US administration is running them down\".\n\nGeorge W Bush had become US president that year, and had decided that Russia's Vladimir Putin was a \"very straightforward and trustworthy\" leader. The 9/11 attacks were very recent and the US needed Russian support to enable the military campaign to go ahead in Afghanistan.\n\nOther stories from the National Archives:\n\nUkraine's Leonid Kuchma repeatedly pressed the EU for membership, here with EU Commissioner Chris Patten\n\nKataryna Wolczuk, professor of East European politics at the University of Birmingham, believes that by 2001 UK leaders had little concern about Russia's future plans for Ukraine, as President Putin was \"still in his Euro-Atlantic ally mood\".\n\nAfter the talks at Chevening with the Ukrainians, Roger Liddle's conclusion was: \"We have too rosy a view of Putin (who according to them is a clever, presentable power politician, but no democratic hero). And we rubbish Ukraine.\"\n\nProf Wolczuk argues that President Kuchma and his entourage were instinctively pro-European: \"They knew they couldn't trust Putin and Russia, and yet the system Kuchma presided over was a hostage of that system.\"\n\nThe archive documents also show support for Ukraine's position from the UK's ambassador to Kyiv, Roland Smith, who cautioned against a proposal by then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw for the EU to give Ukraine \"special neighbour status\" along with Belarus and Moldova.\n\nThe ambassador wondered why the plan appeared formulated to deny Ukraine the chance of full EU membership: \"Because Ukraine is simply too big? Because really we think that Ukraine ought to go back to Russia where she belongs?\"\n\nHe asked why it differed from the plan for countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, which eventually joined the EU in 2007.\n\nIn 2004 Ukrainians took to the streets protesting against electoral fraud, in an Orange Revolution that saw supporters back a pro-European president over a candidate backed by the Kremlin.\n\nIn the event the EU did choose a watered-down relationship for Ukraine and its neighbours, and the UK played a big role in supporting it.\n\nBut Mr Blair's European adviser said in his archived note at the end of 2001 that the main Ukrainian pitch had been for \"associate membership\" of the EU - far stronger than what was then being offered.\n\nThat agreement was eventually signed in 2014, months after Ukraine's pro-Russian president had refused to go through with it, triggering a revolution that ultimately brought him down.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

They also said it was only \"a small minority on both sides [who] try to agitate\".\n\nIsraeli police intervened when two Palestinians were beaten after a confrontation with marchers\n\nPalestinian Authority leaders called the East Jerusalem events a \"provocative act\", saying far-right cabinet ministers Mr Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - staunch supporters of the parade - were \"planting seeds of conflict\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the event would go ahead as planned.\n\nAlong the route in the Old City, Samir Abu Sbeih pulled down the shutters of his sweet shop, saying that police had advised Palestinian businesses to do so by mid-afternoon.\n\n\"It's not their land to celebrate,\" he said of the march. \"We live under occupation and that's why we have to accept it.\"\n\nKebab restaurant owner Basti, who did not want to give his full name, said the event had become \"worse\" over the years.\n\n\"People, when they dance with the flag, sometimes they try to put the flag in your face, sometimes they spit on your face. And this is not nice.\"\n\nHe said police told him he was not being forced to close, but that if he kept his business open, it would be at his own risk.\n\n\"For me, I just want to be inside. I don't like problems, for both sides,\" he said.\n\nJerusalem Day events have been marked by Israelis for decades, but in recent years, parts of the route have been the focus of spiralling tensions.\n\nIn the late afternoon, tens of thousands of Israelis headed from the west of Jerusalem to the Old City, ending with a so-called flag dance at the Western Wall, the holiest site for Jewish prayer.\n\nBefore that, marchers went their separate ways and thousands of mainly men and teenage boys headed into East Jerusalem.\n\nThey walked through Damascus Gate, which Israeli forces usually clear of Palestinians in advance, and then into the Old City's Muslim Quarter.\n\nPrevious years have seen groups of marchers chant \"death to Arabs\" and \"may your village burn\", while others banged the shutters of Palestinian shops.\n\nOne of the marchers, Pini, who didn't want to give his surname, said he had attended for decades to mark the day \"Jerusalem was reunited and returned to the hands of the Jewish people\".\n\n\"From 1948 to 1967, we were prevented from accessing the Western Wall,\" he said referring to the period that East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control. \"We returned to the Western Wall,\" he added.\n\nAsked about a threatening atmosphere for Palestinians, he said he opposed any harassment. But, echoing highly controversial comments this year from a far-right minister, he added: \"There is no such thing as a Palestinian people; when was Palestine established? Is there a Palestinian king? Is there a Palestinian currency?\"\n\nPalestinian militant group Hamas warned Israel this week that it would reignite conflict, were it to cross \"red lines\" in Jerusalem during the event.\n\nOn flag march day in 2021, the group fired rockets at Jerusalem from the Gaza Strip as a week of boiling tensions exploded into war.\n\nHowever, this year, with another round of conflict between Israel and Gaza militants ending only last weekend, appetite for escalation appeared lower.", "The Scottish government announced plans to build a new Border Control Post (BCP) at Cairnryan in 2021\n\nThere is uncertainty over whether new facilities will be built at Cairnryan Port to check goods coming from the Republic of Ireland and wider EU via Northern Ireland.\n\nThe UK is finally due to start implementing post-Brexit controls on EU goods later this year.\n\nIn 2021, the Scottish government announced plans to build a new Border Control Post (BCP) at Cairnryan.\n\nBut a funding dispute with the UK government has stalled work on it.\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Scottish ministers have asked that the full value of border infrastructure be met by the UK government, in line with promises made during the Brexit campaign.\n\n\"We have had no choice but to pause construction of the BCP until these uncertainties are resolved.\"\n\nFrom the end of October food products being exported to Great Britain from the EU will require certification.\n\nPhysical checks of those goods is then due to begin at the end of January next year.\n\nHowever, it is not certain when physical checks on goods from the Republic of Ireland entering Great Britain will begin with the UK government saying a date will be clarified later this year.\n\nThe new checks and controls will not apply to EU goods directly entering Northern Ireland due to the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol/Windsor Framework.\n\nFood products being exported to Great Britain from the EU will soon require certification\n\nThe Cairnryan BCP is politically sensitive because any controls on goods which originate from the Republic of Ireland must not interfere with the free flow of goods from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe UK government has consistently promised that Northern Ireland goods will continue to have \"unfettered access\" to the wider UK market and intends to strengthen that promise in law later this year.\n\nThat \"unfettered access\" includes the commitment that Northern Ireland businesses will not have to provide official declarations of goods which are being moved from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.\n\nThis raises the question of how any officials at Cairnryan will be able to discriminate between goods from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and therefore which loads to inspect.\n\nThe movement of goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain is based on a legal concept known as \"qualifying NI goods\" which states that any goods that are in free circulation in NI qualify for unfettered access.\n\nGoods which start their journey in the EU do not qualify for unfettered access if they are moved through Northern Ireland into Great Britain for \"an avoidance purpose\".\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, trade experts have suggested that avoidance is already happening and could increase when the new border controls are implemented.\n\nCustoms expert Dr Anna Jerzewska told the House of Lords NI Protocol subcommittee that there is \"anecdotal evidence\" of EU companies registering in Northern Ireland for the purpose of moving goods to Great Britain to avoid formalities and tariffs.\n\n\"We are not talking about large multinationals. We are particularly talking about small companies that are able to operate under the radar to a certain extent, with smaller movements,\" she said.\n\nPeter Summerton, managing director at haulage firm McCulla Ireland, told the committee that controls on Republic of Ireland goods at other British ports like Liverpool and Holyhead would be \"completely pointless\" if Cairnryan was allowed to operate as an effective backdoor.\n\n\"The UK has left a clear legislative gap on how movements from Northern Ireland to GB will be controlled, should there be movement from the EU and rest of the world into Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government has said the UK government must \"urgently clarify the policy on Northern Ireland to Great Britain trade\".\n\nA spokesperson said: \"This will be crucial to understanding the impact on businesses and devolved responsibilities.\"\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to creating a seamless, digital border that will improve security and biosecurity while reducing friction for businesses.\n\n\"Whilst responsibility for Border Control Posts is a devolved matter, we are working closely with the Scottish government on the requirements for goods arriving in Cairnryan.\"", "New Zealand's economy has fallen into recession after the country's central bank aggressively raised interest rates to a 14-year high.\n\nIts gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, official figures show.\n\nThat followed a 0.7% contraction in the previous quarter, which means the economy is in a \"technical recession\".\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has increased the cost of borrowing sharply since October 2021.\n\nNew Zealand was one of the first countries to start raising rates in the wake of the pandemic and has outpaced the US Federal Reserve.

Watch: 'I have done nothing wrong' - Nicola Sturgeon\n\nNicola Sturgeon has said she is certain she has done nothing wrong after appearing in public for the first time since her arrest last Sunday.\n\nScotland's former first minister told journalists she intended to be back in the Scottish Parliament this week.\n\nMs Sturgeon was questioned for more than seven hours as part of a police investigation into the SNP's finances.\n\nShe temporarily moved out of her Glasgow home after being released without charge.\n\nReturning there a week after her arrest, the former first minister said: \"For now, I intend to go home and catch up with family.\n\n\"I know I am a public figure - I accept what comes with that. But I'm also a human being that is entitled to a bit of privacy.\"\n\nWhen asked if she had considered stepping back from the SNP, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I have done nothing wrong and that is the only thing I am going to assert today.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell did not return to the house at the same time.\n\nPolice Scotland has been investigating for the past two years what happened to more than \u00a3600,000 of donations given to the SNP by independence activists.\n\nAs part of Operation Branchform, officers searched Ms Sturgeon's home and the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh on 5 April.\n\nEx-SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, was arrested before later being released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nA luxury motorhome which costs about \u00a3110,000 was also seized by police from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline.\n\nAlmost two weeks later, SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was also arrested and released without charge while further inquiries were carried out.\n\nMs Sturgeon, Mr Murrell and Mr Beattie were the three signatories on the SNP's accounts and the arrest of the former first minister had been widely expected - although there was no indication of when it was going to happen.\n\nShe announced on 15 February that she would be standing down as both SNP leader and first minister once a successor was elected, with Humza Yousaf winning the contest to replace her.\n\nMs Sturgeon said at the time that she knew \"in my head and in my heart\" that it was the right time to go, and has since denied the timing was influenced by the police investigation.\n\nShe was Scotland's longest-serving first minister and the only woman to have held the position.", "Masha's school contacted the police, her father said, after the 12-year-old drew this picture\n\nA man sentenced to jail in Russia after his daughter drew an \"anti-war\" picture has been caught in Belarus, after seemingly fleeing the country.\n\nAlexei Moskalev was given a two-year jail sentence in absentia on Tuesday for discrediting the army.\n\nHe came to the attention of authorities last year - after, he said, a school reported the drawing to police.\n\nA lawyer said he was probably caught in Minsk after switching on his mobile phone, which revealed his location.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said \"someone had made a mistake\" to give away his location.\n\n\"Most likely it was due to him using a mobile phone improperly,\" he said.\n\nThat version of events was supported by journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, known for her anti-war protests.\n\n\"He was warned in advance to turn off his mobile phone and pull out the SIM card before escaping. But in Minsk, Alexei decided to turn it on for some reason,\" she wrote, but then deleted the post.\n\nIn 2022, Ms Ovsyannikova also escaped from house arrest, but she managed to leave Russia safely.\n\nThe Belarusian authorities confirmed Mr Moskalev had been detained at Russia's request.\n\nIt is unclear how he made it to Belarus, but people who seek to leave Russia unnoticed by the authorities often leave via Belarusian territory.\n\nMr Moskalev lived about 320 kilometres (200 miles) south of Moscow in a town called Yefremov.\n\nHis problems began after Masha Moskalev, then 12, drew a Ukrainian flag in April last year with the words \"Glory to Ukraine\", rockets and a Russian flag with the phrase \"No to war!\"\n\nHe said the school reported his daughter's drawing to police. After that, Mr Moskalev was fined for an anti-war social media post.\n\nBut after his flat was searched in December he was charged under the criminal code because he had already been convicted of a similar offence.\n\nAuthorities separated Masha from her father and placed her into a children's home, after the case began. She has not been seen in public since 1 March.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Mr Moskalev was sentenced to two years in jail, the court press secretary said he had escaped his house arrest.\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty to the charges, but apparently fled Russia in anticipation of a guilty verdict.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC after the sentencing, the town councillor Olga Podolskaya said she was in \"shock\".\n\n\"A prison sentence for expressing your opinion is a terrible thing. A two-year jail term is a nightmare.\"\n\nAnother lawyer representing the family said he did not know if the teenager had been told her father was on the run.\n\nMs Moskalev has not been seen in public since 1 March", "\"We have the coolest clients of any bank, anywhere\u2026\"\n\nThat was the claim made by Silicon Valley Bank UK last autumn as it celebrated becoming a fully UK-run subsidiary with a promotional video featuring cycle-in branches, ping-pong tables and dogs in the office.\n\nAt around the same time during the UK mini-Budget shock, there was a private fear whispered from regulators. Away from the political blame game, the unpublished Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts and reasonable regulatory questions about an obscure corner of the pension fund market, there was a really big picture concern for the global financial system.\n\nAfter a decade and a half of near zero interest rates, the rapid rise in rates was going to lead to at best unforeseen, unintended consequences in hitherto stable corners of the system. At worst, the pensions \"Liability Driven Investment\" crisis was just the first of a series of ticking timebombs in debt markets that had become rather accustomed to borrowing almost for free.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) has proved to be one of those ticking timebombs. Rising interest rates on government-backed borrowing contributed directly to the problems in the bank's balance sheet. Its key asset - concentrating entirely on the high tech sector - contributed to the herd-like flight of its US deposits last week.\n\nThere is no systemic risk to UK financial stability from the direct fall of Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm, authorities say. That is because it is very small. Authorities won't say how many customers it had, but it only reached \u00a3100m in deposits covered by the protection scheme last August. So we are talking thousands of customers rather than tens of thousands, and it is believed to have had several billion in deposits.\n\nThe UK arm is too small to impact UK financial stability directly. As a result of its establishment as a full UK subsidiary there should also be plenty of assets there to help mitigate the outflow of deposits. But it is considered economically important to many potentially high growth companies. Its customers' business model means they typically have low profits and revenues, and draw down funds from the bank.\n\nWho are those customers? There are two types in the UK - start-up tech companies, and their funders in venture capital and private equity. The government thinks there is a serious risk to the tech sector. Others, such as former top Treasury boss Nick Macpherson fear that offering help beyond the normal \u00a385,000 deposit protection limit could create serious \"moral hazard\", in other words reward risky behaviour.\n\nCould the start-up business customers be treated differently to the big investors? The government is in talks to get other banks to take on the ailing UK arm of SVB or to offer some sort of guarantees to allow clients to pay wages and suppliers. All this comes as the chancellor is planning to make the UK's tech future a centrepiece of his Budget on Wednesday.\n\nOrdinary UK depositors at other banks should be reassured. This is a very specialist bank, only serving customers in a specific sector. However, what is happening in the US is another matter. US regulators do not want to bail out sophisticated tech investors who take financial risks with the promise of fabulous returns.\n\nBut they will be keen to provide enough reassurance to avoid a run on deposits spreading to smaller banks. If that happened it could cast a shadow over other stock markets and the world economy too. So this does matter for UK economic policy and US financial stability. It could also be a canary in the coalmine for other unknown risks as the financial system is upended by the recent end of nearly free money.", "South Korean soldiers stand guard in the village of Panmunjom in the Joint Security Area\n\nNorth Korea is believed to have detained a serving US army soldier who crossed the heavily fortified border from South Korea without permission.\n\nThe man, identified by the Pentagon as Private 2nd Class (PV2) Travis King, 23, was on an organised tour of the UN-run zone dividing the two countries.\n\nThe crisis comes during a particularly tense time with the North, one of the world's most isolated states.\n\nA senior US commander said there had been no contact with the soldier.\n\nAdmiral John Aquilino Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command said he was \"not tracking\" contact with North Korea.\n\nHe said PV2 King had acted willingly by \"making a run\" across the border without authorisation, and the incident was being investigated by US Forces Korea.\n\nOn its travel advisory, the US tells its citizens not to travel to North Korea due to \"the continuing serious risk of arrest\" and the \"critical threat of wrongful detention\".\n\nHours after his detention, North Korea launched two suspected ballistic missiles into the nearby sea, however there has been no suggestion that it is tied to the soldier's detention.\n\nSouth Korea's military confirmed the missile launch, which comes as tensions run high on the Korean peninsula.\n\nIt is unclear if the soldier has defected to North Korea or hopes to return, and there has been no word yet from the North.\n\nIn a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson said that PV2 King had been in the army since January 2021.\n\nHe is a cavalry scout - a reconnaissance specialist - originally assigned to an element of the army's 1st Armoured Division on a rotation with the US military in South Korea.\n\nBut he got into trouble there - officials in Seoul have confirmed that he spent two months in prison for assault charges.\n\nThe Yonhap news agency quoted \"legal sources\" as saying that he was fined for \"repeatedly kicking\" the back door of a police patrol vehicle in the capital's Mapo district, and shouted \"foul language\" at the police who apprehended him.\n\nHe was also suspected of punching a Korean national at a nightclub in September, the report said.\n\nIt is unclear if these were the reasons for his imprisonment.\n\nPV2 King was released from prison on 10 July and was escorted to the airport for a US-bound flight.\n\nSeoul officials said he passed through airport security but then somehow managed to leave the terminal and get on a tour of the border, from where he crossed over into North Korea.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAn eyewitness on the same tour told the BBC's US partner CBS News that they had visited a building at the border site - reported by local media to be the truce village of Panmunjom - when \"this man gives out a loud 'ha ha ha' and just runs in between some buildings\".\n\n\"I thought it was a bad joke at first but, when he didn't come back, I realised it wasn't a joke and then everybody reacted and things got crazy,\" they said.\n\nThe United Nations Command, which operates the Demilitarised Zone and joint security area (JSA), said earlier its team had made contact with the North Korean military to try to negotiate his release.\n\n\"We believe he is currently in DPRK [North Korean] custody and are working with our KPA [Korean People's Army - North Korea's military] counterparts to resolve this incident,\" it said.\n\nIt is unclear where or in what conditions PV2 King is being held.\n\nGreg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told the BBC that authorities in the North were likely to \"try pump information out of him\" about his military service and \"try to coerce him into becoming a propaganda tool\".\n\nThe Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separates the two Koreas and is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.\n\nIt is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing and surveillance cameras. Armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day.\n\nThe DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war.\n\nDozens of people try to escape North Korea every year, fleeing poverty and famine, but defections across the DMZ are extremely dangerous and rare. The country sealed its borders in 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to reopen them.\n\nThe last time a soldier defected at the JSA was in 2017, when a North Korean soldier drove a vehicle, then ran by foot across the military demarcation line, South Korea said at the time.\n\nThe soldier was shot at 40 times, but survived.\n\nBefore the pandemic more than 1,000 people fled from North Korea to China every year, according to numbers released by the South Korean government.\n\nThe detention of the soldier presents a major foreign policy headache for US President Joe Biden. PV2 King is believed to be the only American citizen currently in North Korean custody. Six South Koreans remain in detention there.\n\nRelations between the US and the North plummeted in 2017 after US student Otto Warmbier, who had been arrested a year earlier for stealing a propaganda sign, was returned to the US in a comatose state and later died.\n\nHis family blames the North Korean authorities for his death.\n\nThree US citizens were later freed during Donald Trump's presidency in 2018. But ultimately, a series of talks held between Kim Jong Un and the former US president did little to improve the relationship.\n\nNorth Korea has since tested dozens of increasingly powerful missiles that could carry nuclear warheads, which have been met by a slew of sanctions by the US and its allies.\n\nThe detention of the US national comes on the same day as a US nuclear-capable submarine docked in South Korea for the first time since 1981.\n\nThe submarine was specifically supplied to help the country deal with the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.\n\nAhead of its deployment there were threats of retaliation from the authorities in Pyongyang, which warned the US that sending nuclear weapons to the peninsula could spark a nuclear crisis.", "About half a million people are being evacuated to safer areas in south-eastern Bangladesh, ahead of a cyclone that could be extremely dangerous.\n\nMocha is predicted to make landfall at midday, with 170kph (106mph) winds and storm surges of up to 3.6m (12ft).\n\nThere are concerns the cyclone could hit the world's largest refugee camp, Cox's Bazar, where close to a million people live in makeshift homes.\n\nRains are already falling on the camp and red warning flags have been raised.\n\nCyclone Mocha could be the most powerful storm seen in Bangladesh in nearly two decades.\n\nAs the weather system heads towards the Bangladesh-Myanmar coast, nearby airports have been shut, fishermen have been told to suspend their work and 1,500 shelters have been set up, as people from vulnerable areas are moved to safety.\n\n\"We are ready to face any hazards... we don't want to lose a single life,\" Vibhushan Kanti Das, additional deputy commissioner at Cox's Bazar, told the BBC.\n\nPeople are packing in to cyclone shelters as the storm approaches\n\nThroughout the day, families have been arriving at designated cyclone shelters.

Around 270,000 people also came to the UK to study.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics which collects the numbers said the lifting of travel restrictions after the pandemic may have triggered a bump in the number of students, but added it was too early to say if the rise represented a long-term trend.\n\n\"The numbers are too high, and we want to bring them down,\" Mr Sunak said, adding that figures were higher in 2022 due to Ukrainian refugees coming to the UK, something he said the country should be \"proud of\".\n\nPushed on what an \"acceptable level\" would be in terms of legal migration numbers, Mr Sunak said it would \"depend on how the economy's doing at any particular time and the circumstances we're facing\".\n\n\"So I don't want to put a precise number on it,\" he said, adding that tackling illegal migration was his priority.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in London, the prime minister's spokesman reiterated that Mr Sunak would not \"put a number\" on his preferred level of migration, but added that the PM would \"take stock\" after the new migration figures are released.\n\nEarlier this week, Home Secretary Suella Braverman called for lower immigration, and suggested more British people should be trained to do jobs commonly done by overseas workers, such as lorry driving and fruit picking.\n\nBut Mr Sunak has taken a less hard-line approach, and has said more seasonal fruit pickers will be allowed to come to the UK if required.\n\nWhile many in his party want to see the prime minister reducing net migration, some businesses have argued that would damage their industries, particularly at a time of low unemployment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, CEO of food chain Itsu Julian Metcalfe, said difficulty finding staff was pushing prices up and some restaurants were struggling to open.\n\n\"The cost, particularly for places like Itsu, is going to be very painful for all of us,\" he said and urged the government to introduce a two year working visa.\n\nEarlier this week, the prime minister used his visit to a Council of Europe meeting in Iceland to call for greater cooperation between the UK and EU on illegal migration.\n\nFollowing the summit, Downing Street said the UK and the EU had agreed to work together to tackle cross-border crime and people smuggling.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said setting a net migration target was \"not sensible\".\n\nShe said an immigration system that was \"working properly\" could see an increase in people coming into the country to fulfil \"a short-term need for skills\".\n\n\"But in the medium and long-term, a reduction, because we would be training people up in our own country - we've not had that unfortunately under the Conservatives.\"", "Eve Smith, 21, Rafel Jeanne, 24, and Darcy Ross, 21, died in the collision\n\nTributes have been paid to three people who were found dead in a crashed car days after they went missing.\n\nEve Smith, 21, Darcy Ross, 21 and Rafel Jeanne, 24, were found in a car which had come off a major road in Cardiff.\n\nSophie Russon, 20, and Shane Loughlin, 32, were taken to hospital where they remain in a critical condition.\n\nAll five had been on a night out in Newport when the car is believed to have veered off the A48 into trees, with it unclear what exactly happened.\n\nSophie Russon was having surgery on Monday evening, while friends of the group held a vigil at the scene.\n\nSouth Wales Police said specialist officers are trying to \"piece together\" what happened.\n\nFamily and friends had made repeated appeals to find the missing group over the course of the weekend.\n\nThe mother of one of the women said she had been told to stop contacting police for updates.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Trump wrote, adding it was \"very unfair\" and \"election interference\".\n\nThe post appeared just hours after Judge Juan Merchan said restrictions on what Mr Trump can do and say in relation to the

It will then be for the prime minister to judge whether his findings show that Mr Raab broke ministerial rules on bullying or not.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating eight formal complaints from Mr Raab's time at three government departments, involving at least 24 complainants.\n\nThe complaints relate to Mr Raab's time as justice secretary and foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, and his time as Brexit secretary under Theresa May.\n\nDozens more people have given evidence to the inquiry as witnesses.\n\nThe complainants cannot speak publicly while the inquiry is ongoing, but the BBC has spoken to a number of other people who worked closely with Mr Raab, who characterise his behaviour in different ways.\n\nThey wished to remain anonymous to not compromise their jobs.\n\nSomebody who advised Mr Raab in a senior role in one department said: \"I didn't personally feel bullied.

If you don't treat people humanely, fairly, with respect, the implications are that you're not going to get back quality outcomes.\"\n\nOne of Mr Raab's former parliamentary staffers says he was not a bully, but that reports about his behaviour have resonated with what they witnessed.\n\n\"There were a handful of occasions where I observed him make a member of staff cry, because he was not happy with their work. That was probably one of the things that I found most uncomfortable,\" they said.\n\n\"I think if a colleague cries and they come back to their desk and they're still fretting, and that happens more than once, then I think anybody should recognise that somebody is hurt from that interaction.\"\n\n\"If a member of his staff had delivered some work, which he didn't think was at the standard it should have been, he would tear it apart - frankly literally at times. I did observe that,\" they added.\n\n\"The reason I left was the intensity of the job. I think both professionally and emotionally.\"\n\nAnother parliamentary staffer that Mr Raab's office put us in touch with said they only had good things to say about him.\n\nA different official, who has given evidence to the inquiry and worked with Mr Raab in multiple departments, said even in the most challenging experiences they had \"never seen him swear or raise his voice\".\n\n\"He was always very focused on his job, but always super nice, more perceptive than you'd realise,\" they said.\n\nOn hearing the news of the inquiry they said: \"I was sad because everybody's experience is clearly different and it didn't correlate at all to my experience in the slightest\u2026 I think people would admit he's hard work because he is a perfectionist and he will go above and beyond to deliver for a department he wants to make changes [to].\"\n\nFrom people the BBC has spoken to, Mr Raab's behaviour seems to have had different impacts on different people. At times, similar descriptions of his behaviour are characterised very differently. That is the challenge for the lawyer investigating him.\n\nThe report of the investigation will be made public. Mr Raab has said he will resign if he is found to have been a bully, a judgement Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have to make when presented with the facts.\n\nHe told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was confident he was not a bully and \"behaved professionally throughout\".\n\nHis spokesperson has said that Mr Raab has been \"very clear that he has always acted with professionalism and integrity, that he has never shouted or sworn, that he has enjoyed strong working relationships with a range of fantastic civil servants, and that he will address all allegations put to him in the fair and formal setting of the independent inquiry that he called for\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMatt Hancock was concerned that relaxing Covid isolation rules would imply ministers had been \"getting it wrong\", leaked messages suggest.\n\nIt appears the former health secretary was told in late 2020 that scientific advisers wanted to try replacing 14-day quarantine for confirmed contacts with five days of testing.\n\nHe replied that the idea \"sounds very risky\" and \"like a massive loosening\".\n\nMr Hancock's spokesperson said the story was based on \"partial evidence\".\n\nHe said this latest message exchange showed Mr Hancock was \"in favour of protecting the public and saving lives\" through the pandemic.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify the messages, between Mr Hancock and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty.\n\nThe texts are the latest release from more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages leaked to the Telegraph by journalist Isabel Oakeshott.\n\nThe leaked exchange between the two men took place on 17 November 2020, when confirmed contacts of Covid cases in England had to isolate for 14 days.\n\nProf Whitty is shown telling Mr Hancock that the UK's chief medical officers, as well as Sage, the government's group of scientific advisers, were \"in favour\" of a pilot \"with presumption in favour of testing for 5 days in lieu of isolation (alternative 10 days isolation)\".\n\nHe added that the pilot was to \"check it works\" - whilst the MHRA, the medicines regulator, had \"not yet signed off for self use\".\n\nIn the exchange published by the Telegraph, Mr Hancock replies that the idea \"sounds like a massive loosening\".\n\nProf Whitty then says that scientific modelling \"suggests it's pretty well as good\".\n\nIn a reply, Mr Hancock says he is \"amazed\" - adding that \"this sounds very risky and we can't go backwards\". He asks whether allowing people to test for 10 days would be \"a safer starting point\".\n\nProf Whitty replies that \"we could push to 7 [days]\" but \"the benefits really flatten off after 5\".\n\nMr Hancock is then shown to reply: \"So has the 14 day isolation been too long all this time?\"\n\nThe chief medical officer then replies that a 14-day isolation period is \"marginally safer than 10\" - but at the expense of reduced compliance, meaning \"it probably balances out\".\n\nMr Hancock replies that cutting the isolation period to seven days would be \"huge for adherence\" but any lower than that would \"worry people and imply we'd been getting it wrong\".\n\nProf Whitty then says he will \"go back\" to the chief medical officers, adding, \"I think they will be sympathetic to this\".\n\nThe isolation period for close contacts was reduced to 10 days across the UK the following month.\n\nSome exemptions for double-jabbed critical workers were introduced seven months later, in July 2021, following disruption to businesses and public services.\n\nSelf-isolation for all fully-vaccinated contacts was dropped the month after that.\n\nThe WhatsApp messages were handed to the Telegraph by Ms Oakeshott, who had been given them by Mr Hancock for the purposes of co-writing his book, Pandemic Diaries. She has argued there is a public interest in publishing the messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Hancock said the latest message exchange showed he was \"in favour of protecting the public and saving lives\" - and \"that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone\".\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic Mr Hancock acted to save lives - as the independent inquiry will show,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"We should wait for that to ensure we get a proper understanding of what happened, not be misled by these biased accounts based on an anti-lockdown agenda and partial evidence.\"\n\nA collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph. Here are some of our stories on the leaks:", "The Police Ombudsman found \"collusive behaviour\" by police in 11 loyalist murders, including the 1992 attack at the Sean Graham betting shop\n\nThe term collusion has been raised in several official reports and inquiries related to the Northern Ireland Troubles over the past two decades.\n\nIt is worth stating there is no offence of collusion, although it may involve a criminal act. It has been said to have many faces.\n\nGenerally, it covers a broad range of behaviours, from deliberate wilful actions to \"a look the other way\" approach.\n\nThere is no universally-accepted definition of collusion, but from 2003 onwards judges and others have spelled out what it means in a Northern Ireland context.\n\nTwo opinions became heavily relied upon at an early stage.\n\nSir John (now Lord) Stevens investigated allegations of collusion in several murders when he was police commissioner\n\nSir John (now Lord) Stevens, when he was commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, was among the first to investigate ties between state security forces and loyalists.\n\nHe said collusion ranged from \"the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, through to the extreme of agents being involved in murder\".\n\nShortly after this, Canadian judge Peter Cory was appointed to examine collusion allegations in six specific cases.\n\nHe formed the view that any definition needed to be reasonably broad \"because of the necessity of public confidence\" in state forces such as the police.\n\nFor Judge Cory, it covered \"ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of (state) servants or agents\".\n\nHe also cited supplying agents with information to \"assist in wrongful acts\", or \"encouraging them\" to commit offences.\n\nThe views of Judge Peter Smithwick are also worth noting.\n\nCh Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan were murdered by an IRA gang in 1989\n\nHe headed a tribunal of inquiry in the Republic of Ireland which found collusion between garda (Irish police) officers and the IRA in the murders of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers.\n\nHe said collusion was not just the commissioning of an act, but also an \"unawareness of something that one ought morally, legally or officially to oppose\".\n\nDifferent holders of the office of Police Ombudsman have adopted varying definitions.\n\nMarie Anderson, the current ombudsman, has previously said she favoured a broad interpretation, reflecting the views of Lord Stevens and Judge Cory.\n\nBut there has been a tweak in phraseology.\n\nHer particular terminology is \"collusive behaviour\" and this has its roots in a court case brought in 2020 by retired Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers around the ombudsman's powers.\n\nIn 2022, a group of officers were granted a judicial review of the ombudsman's legal right to make findings of collusive behaviour by the High Court.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Retired Police Officers Association wants statements issued by Marie Anderson to be declared unlawful.", "King Charles and Queen Camilla have been crowned on a historic day at Westminster Abbey.\n\nHere's the best bits of the day.\n\nYou can watch full highlights of the Coronation now, on BBC iPlayer.", "A deadline has passed for the government to hand over unredacted material to the Covid inquiry, amid a row over WhatsApp messages.\n\nIt was given until 4pm to disclose messages between Boris Johnson and his advisers during the pandemic, as well as his diaries and notebooks.\n\nIt has refused to disclose some of the material, arguing it is not relevant to the inquiry's work.\n\nBut the inquiry's boss says deciding what is relevant should be her job.\n\nIt is not yet clear what will happen next. The stand-off could potentially lead to a legal battle between the inquiry and Cabinet Office, the government department that supports the prime minister.\n\nThere has been no word from the inquiry or the Cabinet Office over whether more material has been disclosed.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a summit in Moldova, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government was confident in its position and was \"considering next steps\".\n\nThe inquiry, set up in May 2021, is investigating the government's handling of the pandemic and is due to begin public hearings in two weeks.\n\nMr Johnson has urged the Cabinet Office to hand the material to the inquiry in full without redactions, adding that he would do so himself \"if asked\".\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the former prime minister said he had now given the department all the documents, adding it had had \"access\" to the material for several months.\n\nThe Cabinet Office - which had earlier told the inquiry it didn't have all the WhatsApps or notebooks - then said officials were assessing them.\n\nThe material sought by the inquiry includes WhatsApp messages on Mr Johnson's devices from a group chat set up to discuss the pandemic response.\n\nIt has also asked to see WhatsApp messages on his devices he exchanged with a host of politicians, including his successor Rishi Sunak, as well as various civil servants, including the UK's top civil servant Simon Case.\n\nIt has also asked for the former prime minister's diaries, as well as 24 notebooks in which he made contemporaneous notes.\n\nBut in a challenge to the request, the Cabinet Office said the WhatsApp threads contained some messages that are \"unambiguously irrelevant\" to the inquiry's remit.\n\nIt said these included discussion of \"entirely separate\" policy areas, diary arrangements unconnected to Covid, references to disciplinary matters, and \"comments of a personal nature\" about individuals.\n\nDisclosing the messages, it added, could breach individuals' right to privacy and undermine the ability of ministers to discuss policy matters in the future.\n\nHowever, crossbench peer Baroness Hallett, who chairs the inquiry, said the information it had requested was \"potentially relevant\" to its task of investigating government decision-making.\n\nExamining \"superficially unrelated\" political matters might be necessary, she argued, to understand the broader context in which decisions were made.\n\nShe revealed that material redacted, or blanked out, by the Cabinet Office includes chats about relations between the UK and Scottish government, and the way in which WhatsApp itself should be used by ministers to discuss government policy.\n\n\"These are matters that I and my team are better placed to assess than any document provider,\" she added.\n\nBaroness Hallett has previously warned that a failure to disclose the material the inquiry has requested would be a criminal offence.\n\nThe Cabinet Office has questioned whether the inquiry has the power to request \"entirely personal\" WhatsApp messages, and is reportedly considering asking a judge to review whether the demands are legal.\n\nThe matter has been seen as a litmus test of the ability of public inquiries to get hold of messages on WhatsApp, which has become an increasingly popular means of communication within Westminster in recent years.\n\nHowever, some senior Conservative MPs have urged the government to back down to avoid a lengthy legal showdown.\n\nWilliam Wragg, chairman of a parliamentary committee on constitutional affairs, said on Wednesday: \"If the inquiry requests documents and info - then whoever it has asked should comply.\"\n\nThere has been friction between Mr Sunak's government and Mr Johnson over the Cabinet Office's decision to refer him to police over further potential Covid rule breaches during the pandemic.\n\nThe Cabinet Office said it made the referral following a review of his official diary by government lawyers as part of the Covid inquiry.\n\nThe former PM has dismissed claims of any breaches as a \"politically motivated stitch-up\".", "Sir Keir Starmer has visited Chatham after a \"historic\" victory for Labour in the local elections.\n\nThe Conservatives have lost control of Medway Council in Kent for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nLabour secured 33 seats, which was enough to take control of the council. The Conservatives have 22 and there are four independents.\n\nThe Labour leader said: \"You didn't just get it over the line. You blew the doors off.\"\n\nThe unitary authority was previously held by the Conservatives with a majority of 11.\n\nSir Keir said: \"Make no mistake, we are on course for a Labour majority at the next general election.\n\n\"We've won the trust and confidence of voters and now we can go on and change our country.\"\n\nAll 55 council seats in Medway were up for election, along with four new seats created by boundary changes.\n\nTunbridge Wells remained with no overall majority - the council has seen a trend away from the Conservatives\n\nThe Conservatives held Dartford and Sevenoaks, but across the South East, the so-called \"blue wall\" appeared to be crumbling, with the party losing seats.\n\nIn Canterbury, where sewage has been a big issue, the leader lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats. Another Tory candidate conceded before counting had even begun, but the council remained under no overall control.\n\nIn Folkestone and Hythe, the Greens have made waves after campaigning hard against a controversial development in Hythe. They unseated the authority's Conservative leader and become the largest party.\n\nLabour have taken both Gravesham and Dover. Dover was previously a Conservative-run council. Gravesham was under no overall control.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives have lost control of Maidstone, leaving a hung council. The Tories remain the largest party with 23 seats, while the Liberal Democrats, independents, Labour and the Greens have 11, 10, five and three respectively.\n\nIn Tunbridge Wells, there remains no overall majority, with no parties losing any seats. The council has seen a trend away from the Conservatives after they lost control in 2021.\n\nAshford, which remains under no overall control, saw the Greens gain six seats and the Conservatives lose seven. The Conservatives are the largest party on the council.\n\nIn Thanet, the Conservatives lost eight seats, while Labour gained 10 and took control of the council, which previously had no overall majority.\n\nThe Tories also lost Tonbridge and Malling to no overall control.\n\nSwale remained under no overall control.\n\nMedway Labour leader Vince Maple (right) hailed the win as \"historic\"\n\nMedway Labour leader Vince Maple told BBC Radio Kent the local result was \"historic\" for the area.\n\n\"We've had a result tonight that I don't think we even expected,\" he said.\n\n\"We've never had since the creation of Medway Council a Labour majority council.\"\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Hopefully we will.\"\n\nThe launch has had a warm response online, with one person telling the BBC they saw Threads as a \"much-needed competitor\" to Twitter.\n\nCompetitors have criticised the amount of data the app might use. This may include health, financial, and browsing data linked to users' identities, according to the Apple App Store.\n\nSome users have also expressed concern that it is not possible to delete your Threads profile without deleting the associated Instagram profile. Meta told the BBC: \"At this time, you can't delete your Threads profile without deleting your Instagram account. This is something we're working on. In the meantime, you can deactivate your Threads profile at any time.\n\n\"Deactivating your Threads profile will not deactivate your Instagram account\".\n\nDeactivation will mean your Threads profile, your posts and interactions with others' posts won't be visible, the firm added.\n\nUsers can download and delete Threads data by visiting their Instagram settings, Meta says.\n\nThreads is now available to download in over 100 countries including the UK, but not yet in the EU because of regulatory concerns.\n\nHave you signed up for Threads and what do you think of the app? Tell us by emailing: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways:\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, called the new app an \"initial version\", with extra features planned including the ability to interact with people on other social media apps like Mastodon.\n\n\"Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and expand that to text,\" the firm said prior to its launch.\n\nDespite Threads being a standalone app, users log in using an Instagram account. Their Instagram username carries over, but there is an option to customize their profile specifically for Threads.\n\nUsers will also be able to choose to follow the same accounts they do on Instagram, Meta says. The app allows users to be private on Instagram, but public on Threads.\n\nThe new app's release comes after criticism of Meta's business practices.\n\nLast year, Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen said the company had put \"profits over safety\" and criticised how the platform was moderated.\n\nThe company was also rocked by a scandal in which it allowed third parties, including British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, to access Facebook users' personal data.\n\nIn an apparent reference to this controversial past, Mr Musk joked on Monday \"thank goodness they're so sanely run\".\n\nThere are several alternatives to Twitter available, such as Bluesky and Mastodon, but these have struggled to gain traction.\n\nThreads has a significant advantage because it is connected to Instagram, and the hundreds of millions of users already on that platform.\n\nOn Threads, posts can be shared to Instagram and vice versa and can include links, photos, and videos of up to five minutes in length.\n\nHowever, some early users on Wednesday reported problems when uploading images, hinting at teething problems.\n\nUsers see a feed of posts, which Meta calls \"threads\", from people they follow as well as recommended content.\n\nThey are able to control who can \"mention\" them and filter out replies to posts that contain specific words.\n\nUnfollowing, blocking, restricting or reporting other profiles is also possible, and any accounts users block on Instagram are automatically blocked on Threads.\n\nWhile Meta stresses ties to Instagram, media coverage has focused on its similarity to Twitter, with some investors describing the app as a \"Twitter killer\".\n\nPosts can be shared between Threads and Instagram and can include links, photos, and videos\n\nOn Saturday, Twitter boss Elon Musk restricted the number of tweets users could see on his platform per day, citing extreme \"data scraping\".\n\nIt was Mr Musk's latest push to get users to sign up to Twitter Blue, the platform's subscription service.\n\nTwitter has also announced that its popular user dashboard TweetDeck will go behind a paywall in 30 days' time.\n\nSince Mr Musk took over, many users of Twitter have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the platform and his stewardship - citing erratic behaviour and political views.\n\nLast month, Mr Musk and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg agreed - possibly in jest - to a cage fight, and Mr Zuckerberg's early posts on Threads mentioned his interest in mixed martial arts.\n\nWhile Threads will be available in the UK, it is not yet available in the EU because of regulatory uncertainty, particularly around the EU's Digital Markets Act.\n\nBut the company says it is looking into launching in the EU.\n\nThat act lays down rules on how large companies such as Meta can share data between platforms that they own. The sharing of data between Threads and Instagram is part of the issue.\n\nMeta maintains protecting privacy is fundamental to its business.", "In Washington, US officials have confirmed that Russian and American diplomats spoke directly on Saturday.\n\nThe US emphasised to Moscow that Washington was not involved in stoking up tensions between Wagner and the Kremlin, officials are saying.\n\n\"There were appropriate diplomat discussions that occurred over the weekend,\" said White House spokesman John Kirby without specifying at what level talks occurred.\n\nHe added Washington views the tensions with Wagner \"as internal Russian matters\" and has not taken a side.\n\nBiden remains focused on supporting Ukraine, rather than meddling in Russia, and spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, Kirby continued.\n\n\"We're not involved and have no intention of being involved,\" he said about the current situation in Russia.\n\n\"What we are involved with is supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nAt the Department of State, spokesman Matthew Miller said the communications involved the US ambassador to Russia as well as \"at other levels here in Washington\".\n\nTwo messages were sent, he said.

That includes stars of HBO's House of the Dragon.\n\nThe union has however told US companies it will be keeping a \"very close eye\" on any attempts to move US productions to the UK.", "The men appeared at The Old Bailey in London\n\nTwo men have admitted removing body parts, including the penis, of a man accused of being the ringleader of a group carrying out and broadcasting castrations.\n\nThe men, of London, admitted causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent.\n\nMr Gustavson, 45, is accused of leading an extreme body modification operation.\n\nA third man, who prosecutors said was a \"key player, who had a role as a surgeon in a very large number of procedures\", also admitted several offences.\n\nPeter Wates, 66, from Croydon in south London, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH between 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2022.\n\nProcedures, including the removal of penises and testicles, were allegedly filmed and uploaded to a payable subscription \"eunuch maker\" website, run by the alleged ringleader Mr Gustavson, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nThe practice is linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed, the court was told.\n\nWates, Byrnes and Arnold appeared in court alongside Mr Gustavson and five other defendants who were not asked to enter pleas.\n\nOne of those defendants yet to enter a plea, Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 22, from Epsom, Surrey, is accused of freezing Mr Gustavson's leg requiring amputation.

The subsidies are likely to be in the form of cash grants, discounts on the cost of energy, and training and research funding.\n\nBut Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the BBC that Tata's decision was based on a wider range of factors.\n\n\"Tata is an international business and will consider a number of factors when deciding where to invest. Last autumn the chancellor cut taxes specifically so that we could encourage investments like this,\" he said.\n\n\"We're making lots of changes and it's this whole package that's attractive, like investment in skills and apprenticeships, infrastructure in road, rail and broadband.\n\n\"It's also the approach we're taking to regulation after leaving the EU,\" he added.\n\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP welcomed the decision, saying it came \"after years of the south west being neglected by government investment\".\n\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that the investment had come at a critical time for the UK.\n\n\"With the global industry transitioning at pace to electrification, producing batteries in the UK is essential if we are to anchor wider vehicle production here for the long term,\" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.\n\nBatteries typically account for a large proportion of the value of an electric vehicle, so a reliable supply is expected to be vital for the future of the UK car industry.\n\nBut the government has been criticised for lacking a clear industrial strategy and falling behind the US and EU in attracting investment in low-carbon technologies such as battery manufacturing.\n\nSharon Graham, general secretary at the Unite union, said: \"The US and Europe have clear, proactive plans for jobs and investment. We cannot continually lag behind.\"\n\nShe said the government should use the opportunity to set out a \"strategic long-term industrial plan\", and require that the new factory be constructed with UK-made steel.\n\nSome industry insiders hope that the Tata battery investment will open the door to further battery investments in the UK.\n\nThe UK currently only has one plant in operation next to Nissan's Sunderland factory, and one barely on the drawing board in Northumberland.\n\nAnother proposed battery manufacturer, in the north east of England, Britishvolt, went into administration earlier this year.\n\nBy contrast the EU has 35 plants open, under construction or planned.\n\nShadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds welcomed Tata's new plant, adding that Labour would ensure \"announcements like this aren't a one-off, but the basis for a growing economy, with good jobs in our industrial heartlands\".\n\nAs well as owning Jaguar Land Rover, Tata has extensive steel interests in the UK including the Port Talbot plant in South Wales and the government is also expected to offer around \u00a3300m to subsidise, upgrade, and decarbonise those operations.\n\nParliament's cross-party Business and Trade Committee is holding an inquiry into the UK's electric vehicle battery manufacturing sector.\n\nIts chairman Darren Jones, said Tata's decision to site the new plant in the UK was \"very welcome\" but he raised questions over the scale of the subsidies provided.\n\n\"We will want to reflect... on the subsidy package that was required to secure this decision and if this approach is scalable to meet the need for further battery manufacturing sites for other car companies across the UK.\"\n\nThose concerns were echoed by the FairCharge group, which represents other companies in the electric vehicle sector.\n\nFairCharge's founder, Quentin Willson, said there was a fear in the industry that Tata's investment could \"sweep up\" all available government support.\n\n\"I truly hope that other companies in the battery, critical minerals, charging and EV supply chains won't be neglected,\" he said.\n\nAndy Palmer, former executive at Nissan and Aston Martin - who is now at EV charging firm Pod Point - said the UK needed a strategic industrial strategy to \"lift all boats\".\n\n\"Support must come in all shapes and sizes for businesses of all shapes and sizes,\" he said. \"One gigafactory doesn't equal success, it equals part of the puzzle.\"", "The Scotland team celebrate the country's first world title since 2009\n\nThe team, led by skip Bruce Mouat, took the title with a decisive 9-3 triumph in Calgary on Sunday.\n\nScotland's win is the country's sixth triumph in the annual championships and its first since 2009.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has led tributes to the team, which includes the son of a former world champion.\n\nHammy McMillan followed in the footsteps of his father Hammy Snr who lifted the title in 1999.\n\nHammy Jnr told British Curling: \"I have always looked up to him and when we put the team together he has always been our biggest supporter.\n\n\"From that very first Scottish championships he said to me and the boys that we have something special and he wasn't wrong.\n\n\"This journey we have been on since the summer of 2017 has been special.\"\n\nThe Scotland team celebrate with team staff and supporters\n\nHammy Snr described watching the win as \"an unbelievable feeling.\"\n\nAsked if he had finally handed the baton over, he joked: \"I think I handed it over a few years ago.\n\n\"These guys play a different style of curling.\n\n\"They have all the advantages of snow and ice and they know what to do with sweeping.\n\n\"They have worked it out and they are good at it - unbelievably good at it.\"\n\nMcMillan also lined up alongside his cousin Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Mouat.\n\nThe three-time European champions have now added a world title to an impressive CV which includes an Olympic silver medal.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\nMr Tate's lawyers say he will be held until the end of April.\n\nBritish investigators are also helping Romanian police with information from the UK side, the BBC has learned.\n\nThe brothers' lawyers said that prosecutors had brought no new evidence to Wednesday's hearing.\n\nThey also suggested their clients' notoriety was contributing to the decision to keep them in custody.\n\nMateea Petrescu, spokeswoman for the Tates, said that - for the first time - the judge had asked the brothers to respond directly to prosecution arguments that they were a flight risk and a risk to public order.\n\nAndrew Tate, 36 and his brother Tristan, 34, were arrested in late December 2022.\n\nDespite what was described as a \"dynamic exchange\", the judge eventually ruled the two men should be kept in preventative custody for another 30 days, until the end of April.\n\nMs Petrescu said the team was \"speechless\" at the court's decision.\n\nShe said the continued detention had \"irreparably harmed\" the brothers' image and that it would \"take years to rebuild their reputation\".\n\nA lawyer acting for the Tates in the US recently contacted one of the alleged victims in the case, threatening to sue her and her family for $300m (\u00a3244m) for defamation unless she retracted her claims.\n\nJudges have consistently justified their decision to keep them in custody, on grounds that they might pressure witnesses or interfere with evidence.\n\nAt previous hearings, investigators have reportedly presented evidence from phone calls recorded during the brothers' detention.\n\nUnder Romanian law, suspects can be kept in detention for up to six months without trial, with the agreement of the courts.\n\nAnother lawyer, Eugen Vidineac, told the BBC: \"In all the volumes of the file, you never find one piece of paper with pornographic content to sustain the theory that [the women] were obliged to post pornographic content\".\n\nBut leaked court documents, seen by the BBC last month, outlined testimony from alleged victims claiming to be forced to earn \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,800) a month on social media platforms, under the alleged threat of physical violence.\n\nCourt papers also described debts being used as \"a form of psychological coercion\".\n\nSince investigations began here last April, six women have been identified by prosecutors as victims.\n\nFour of them are believed to have given testimony against the Tates.\n\nTwo others have said they do not consider themselves as victims, but are reportedly still being treated as such by investigators, on the grounds some victims retain a strong emotional bond to their traffickers.\n\nOne expert in human trafficking law said, in any future trial, it is crucial prosecutors present hard evidence rather than rely solely on victim testimony.\n\nRomanian-American University's Silvia Tabusca told the BBC: \"What's different [in the Tate investigation] is the way the prosecutor has started to build the case.\"\n\nSilvia Tabusca is a Romanian organised crime expert from the European Center for Legal Education and Research\n\n\"Usually, most of the cases in Romania are built on the testimony of the victim, but in this case, I see that a lot is based on other types of evidence, mainly wire-tapping and information from their computers and programmes.\"\n\nShe says there is a legal overlap in Romania between human trafficking - which implies force or coercion; and pimping - which implies a victim's consent.\n\n\"There is huge public pressure on victims,\" she said.\n\n\"We've learned that after two or three years, victims are not willing to cooperate with the court. So if the trial is built mainly on the testimony of the victim, the [defence] lawyers can easily change the charge from human trafficking to pimping.\"\n\nThere are also legal loopholes around online exploitation - something the European Union is currently trying to tighten.\n\n\"The means and tools that traffickers use have changed,\" said Malin Bj\u00f6rk, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the issue.\n\nShe's heading discussions on a new EU directive which \"makes clear that crimes conducted online are just as criminal as those off-line\".\n\nIt is expected to be voted on by the European Parliament this summer.\n\nInvestigators in Romania have now begun looking into financial records, with a new focus on possible money-laundering.\n\nDaniel Ticau, a former prosecutor with the organised crime unit leading the Tate investigation, said this case could shine a spotlight on Romania's capacity to carry out these kinds of probes.\n\n\"From my point of view, there is a serious lack of political will to develop this capacity to properly handle the parallel financial investigations in organised crime, and in particular in human trafficking, drug trafficking and other serious crimes,\" he said.\n\nMs Tabusca added that Romania faces a striking lack of resources more generally.\n\n\"At present, there are more than 800 ongoing cases of human trafficking, many of them international cases and very complicated cases,\" she explained.\n\n\"For these 800 cases, we have seven prosecutors and 48 police officers.\"\n\nAs well as investigating ongoing cases of alleged human trafficking, she said, they also have to constantly monitor the phenomenon among a population of more than 20 million people.\n\nIt can take months or years to put together an indictment in a human trafficking case.\n\nWith three months left before Andrew and Tristan Tate must be either released from custody or brought to trial, the spotlight is on Romania to show it can handle the pressure.", "Large crowds gathered in Belfast to try and catch a glimpse of US President Joe Biden as he made a landmark visit to Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Biden is on a four-day visit to the island of Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe president arrived in Belfast city centre late on Tuesday night after making the journey from the airport in his presidential motorcade.\n\nOn Wednesday he made a speech at the new Ulster University campus in Belfast before meeting people in the audience, shaking their hands and taking selfies.\n\nHundreds waited to see the presidential motorcade close to Belfast City Hall\n\nSome, like Tiernan Lynch and his dad Michael, had planned to join the crowd\n\nOthers, like Nora and Chase from Boston, USA, made it to Belfast at the same time as the president purely by chance\n\nIt was an opportunity for some groups to protest\n\nPolitical messages for Joe Biden were left on Black Mountain, which overlooks Belfast\n\nOther messages were somewhat esoteric...\n\nA huge security operation was in place in the city\n\nSeveral major roads were closed as a result of it\n\nAnne Marshall (left) and Alison Savage were on a city break to Belfast and described the president's visit as \"an historic day\"\n\nGabrielle Feenan, who introduced President Biden on stage at Ulster University, had to keep her starring role secret from family and friends\n\nPeople filled the balconies of the university to hear the president speak\n\nJoe Biden took to the stage early in the afternoon\n\nThe president was only the second biggest celebrity in the room - Oscar winner James Martin nearly stole the show\n\nThere were opportunities for a once-in-a-lifetime selfie\n\nPragya and Adanna, who managed to get a selfie with the president, said the day was an amazing experience\n\nAfter the speech President Biden was whisked away in his armoured limousine, affectionately known as The Beast\n\nHe gave the people of Belfast a final thumbs-up before travelling to the Republic of Ireland for the remainder of his Irish tour", "American Kristopher Kortright, known as \"Voltage\", has been launching hacking operations against Russia since the invasion\n\nA team of vigilante hackers carrying out cyber-attacks against Russia has been sent awards of gratitude by Ukraine's military.\n\nThe team, One Fist, has stolen data from Russian military firms and hacked cameras to spy on troops.\n\nThe certificates are a controversial sign of how modern warfare is shifting.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the practice of states encouraging civilian hackers.\n\nOne of the hackers called \"Voltage\" has been co-ordinating hacks from his home in the US.\n\nHis real name is Kristopher Kortright and he is an IT worker from Michigan.\n\nThe 53-year-old told the BBC he is delighted his efforts for Ukraine have been officially recognised with a certificate of gratitude.\n\nOne Fist is made up of hackers from eight different countries including the UK, US and Poland. They have collectively launched dozens of cyber-attacks - celebrating each one on social media.\n\nThe certificates were sent to them all for \"a significant contribution to the development and maintenance of vital activities of the military\". They were signed by the commander of the Airborne Assault Forces of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Defence did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, Ukraine has controversially been encouraging volunteer hackers to attack Russian targets. But sending out official awards to foreign civilians is being seen as a controversial move and a sign of the times.\n\nAlthough many nations, including the UK and the US, have official award systems for ethical hacking, this is thought to be the first time a country has awarded hackers for malicious and possibly criminal hacks.\n\nIn October, in response to the increase in vigilante hacking in Ukraine and in the Gaza conflict, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned against the use and encouragement of civilian hackers. It published guidelines to reinforce the ethos of the rules of war laid out in the existing Geneva Conventions.\n\nA member of a Polish vigilante hacking gang called Squad 303 which has also carried out attacks on Russia\n\nDr Lukasz Olejnik, author of Philosophy of Cyber-security, said Ukraine's awards to foreign hackers are potentially problematic.\n\n\"Giving out awards may further blur the lines between combatants and civilians, and even undermine the recent call by the ICRC to limit and end the involvement of civilians in combat operations. In the long run, such an erosion is dangerous,\" he said.\n\nDr Olejnik also said it is a \"testament of our times\" that cyber is now considered as a domain of operations and that anyone can join the fight online.\n\nKristopher started hacking Russia when it launched the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and says he has devoted himself to the cause and sacrificed a lot.\n\n\"I've lost my job doing this and spent all my life savings in pursuit of a victory for Ukraine,\" he said from his home office. \"This award is a real morale-booster,\" he said.\n\nThe awards do not state which cyber-attacks were most useful, but Voltage has three in mind as the most likely candidates.\n\nAt the start of the invasion in 2022, One Fist spent months mapping out the physical and cyber-locations of hundreds of publicly viewable CCTV cameras in Ukraine. It was discovered that Russian forces were using them to monitor troops, so his team helped get the cameras switched off.\n\nConversely, it was One Fist that hacked into cameras in occupied Crimea to catalogue Russian tanks and equipment being moved over the Kerch bridge.\n\nOne Fist hacked cameras to allow Ukraine to watch Russian equipment transport\n\nAnd most recently, in January, Kristopher and others also successfully hacked into a prominent Russian weapons-maker and stole 100 gigabytes of private data, which led to a public celebration from the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"The array of information transferred to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine contains drawings, specifications, patents, software referring to both existing and promising military developments,\" the announcement said.\n\nUkraine added that the data stolen was a \"significant blow\" to Moscow and worth $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) - although it did not say how this figure was reached\n\nThe Ukraine conflict prompted a surge of cyber-activity - mostly from supporters of Ukraine. Groups like the Anonymous collective targeted Russia with disruptive and low-level hacks that Russia largely brushed off.\n\nIn some instances, TV and radio stations were hijacked and news websites defaced.\n\nRussian authorities too have been accused of working with vigilante hacking groups like Killnet to attack Ukraine, but has never admitted having any relationship to the gangs.\n\nKillnet's leader denies working with Russian authorities on hacks against Ukraine\n\nMost of the vigilante hacking activity on both sides dissipated after the first year as the war ground on. But One Fist has kept attacking Russia and increasingly worked closely with the Ukrainian forces on choosing targets.\n\nEmily Taylor, chief executive of Oxford Information Labs and editor of Chatham House Cyber Policy journal, agrees that the hacking awards are a landmark moment that might shift thinking about how cyber volunteers are used in conflicts.\n\n\"Governments usually discourage non-state actors from taking direct action in the cyber-domain, for fear of escalation or unintended consequences, but wartime is often a period of extraordinary technological innovation, and the Ukraine invasion is no exception,\" she said.\n\n\"Sometimes these events force a reconsideration of issues that have previously been taboo.\"\n\nKristopher says his team has built up a strong relationship with the Ukrainian military. \"They send us ideas and we send them options but they don't ever give us any help or funding as I think that would cross some sort of line,\" he said.\n\nKristopher recognises that receiving military awards is controversial, but is determined to keep hacking for Ukraine.", "Lucy Letby, 33, is accused of murdering babies on a neo-natal ward\n\nNurse Lucy Letby has \"deliberately misled\" the jury on a number of occasions throughout her murder trial, a prosecutor has told a court.\n\nOn the final day of cross-examination, prosecutor Nick Johnson KC said Ms Letby was a \"very calculating woman\" who had lied \"to try and get sympathy\".\n\nThe 33-year-old is charged with murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016.\n\nShe has denied all charges against her.\n\nQuestioning the former nurse for a tenth day at Manchester Crown Court, Mr Johnson focused on the events following Ms Letby's removal from the neonatal unit in July 2016.\n\nJurors have previously heard that Ms Letby was moved to the Countess of Chester Hospital's \"risk and patient safety office\" after doctors raised concerns over her alleged involvement in baby deaths.\n\nSenior doctors at the hospital requested Ms Letby be taken off front-line duties after the deaths of triplet brothers, known to the court as Child O and P for legal reasons, in June 2016.\n\nMs Letby was placed on a three-month \"secondment\" to the office and told she would be placed under \"clinical supervision\".\n\nWhen she was arrested in July 2018, she told police she felt \"panicked\" and \"overwhelmed\" and had suicidal thoughts following the move.\n\nShe also previously told her trial she was only permitted to speak to a select few members of staff at the hospital during the period.\n\nMr Johnson said that claim was not correct and showed the court Facebook and phone records that were \"peppered with [Ms Letby] socialising with lots of different people from that unit\".\n\nShe agreed with his assertion that she had had \"a very active social life\", but denied his subsequent claim that she had \"deliberately misled the jury about this background\".\n\nLucy Letby is charged with murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others at the Countess of Chester Hospital\n\nHe then asked her about her arrest, which he said she had claimed saw her being led away from her home in a nightgown.\n\nHe said Ms Letby was actually wearing a blue Lee Cooper leisure suit at the time.\n\nShe said she did not know why she had lied about that detail.\n\n\"You're a very calculating woman, aren't you, Lucy Letby?\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"You tell lies deliberately and the reason you tell lies is to get sympathy and attention from people.\"\n\nThe prosecutor then asked Ms Letby about various notes which were found in her home when police searched it in 2018 and in particular, about one on which she had written that she would never marry or have children.\n\nHe asked her why she wrote this when she had \"a house, a car [and] a boyfriend\".\n\nShe agreed had those things, but added: \"That's how I felt at the time.\"\n\n\"You felt like this because you knew you had killed and grievously injured these children,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\n\"That is the truth, you have murdered these children.\"\n\n\"I have never murdered a child or harmed any of them,\" she replied.\n\nLucy Letby claimed that hospital bosses had conspired against her to cover up shortcomings on the neonatal unit\n\nHe also asked the former nurse about social media searches which were made to find the parents of the children involved in the case.\n\nShe has previously said searching for people on Facebook was \"a normal pattern of behaviour for me\" and was not confined to those parents.\n\nMr Johnson repeatedly pressed Ms Letby to explain why she had searched for certain parents, adding that she was \"a killer who was looking at your victims\".\n\nShe denied that accusation, adding that the people had been \"on my mind\".\n\nThe former nurse was also asked about her claim that hospital bosses had conspired against her to cover up shortcomings on the neonatal unit.\n\nShe has previously told her trial that a \"gang of four\" doctors apportioned \"blame\" on to her \"to cover up failings at the hospital\".\n\nMr Johnson asked what the conspiracy between the four was.\n\n\"I believe there were shortcomings from the medical team and they put that on me,\" she said.\n\nWhy not

Their son Archie was born in May 2019.\n\nThe BBC understands members of the Royal Family were invited to the christening but it appears none were in attendance.\n\nHarry and Meghan are understood to want their children to decide for themselves whether or not to use their titles when they are older.\n\nThe couple will not use the titles conversationally, the BBC understands, but Archie and Lilibet will be referred to as prince and princess in formal contexts.\n\nThe children will not be able to style themselves as HRH given the right to do so comes from their father and he stopped using it when he stepped back from being a working royal.\n\nThe rules governing the titles of royal children were set out by King George V in 1917.\n\nAs the children of the son of a sovereign, Archie and Lilibet are automatically entitled to be called prince and princess.\n\nRight Reverend John Harvey Taylor, the Bishop of Los Angeles, presided over the christening.\n\nThe ex-newspaper journalist worked in the office of former US President Richard Nixon between 1984 and 1990 prior to being ordained.\n\nEarlier this week, it emerged that Harry and Meghan were weighing up whether or not to travel to the UK for the King and Queen Consort's coronation.\n\nA statement issued on behalf of the couple said Harry had been contacted about the event on 6 May by the King's private office via email.\n\nThe BBC understands some prospective guests are being asked to save the date ahead of official invitations to be sent later.\n\nBuckingham Palace has declined to comment on the guest list.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nRon DeSantis's long-awaited entry into the 2024 race for the White House was hit by technical glitches after a Twitter livestream malfunctioned.\n\nIt meant the Florida governor's bid for the Republican presidential nomination got under way 20 minutes late.\n\nHe went on to use the event to champion his conservative credentials, his anti-lockdown stance and education reforms.\n\n\"I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback,\" he said.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed as former President Donald Trump's chief rival to be their party's candidate in the 2024 general election.\n\nMr DeSantis is a relative newcomer in US politics, having first been elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. Just six years later in 2018 - after a failed bid to become a senator - he was elected governor of Florida.\n\nHe has overseen the enactment of high-profile laws that make it easier to own a gun, restrict sex and gender identity education in schools, and curtail abortion access.\n\nHe has claimed that this \"Florida Blueprint\" can act as a guide for federal policies, one that would move the US in a sharply conservative direction.\n\nHe joins a growing list of contenders seeking to unseat Mr Trump, who leads the Republican field by more than 30 points in national opinion polls.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBy the time Wednesday evening's Twitter talk had begun in earnest, hundreds of thousands of Twitter users had left the platform.\n\nSince Mr Musk took the reins at Twitter in October, he has laid off thousands of employees, including engineers responsible for the site's operations and technical troubleshooting.\n\nMr DeSantis's team worked quickly to spin the technical stumbles, writing on Twitter that the announcement had broken \"the internet with so much excitement\", and posting a link to the campaign website.\n\nHis press secretary Bryan Griffin claimed the online event had raised $1m (\u00a3808,000) in an hour.\n\nAt one point, the Twitter event drew more than 600,000 listeners, according to Reuters news agency figures, but by its conclusion, there were fewer than 300,000. The BBC's interview with Elon Musk last month drew more than three million listeners on Twitter Spaces.\n\nOnce under way, Mr DeSantis turned the conversation to his conservative credentials, touting his handling of the Covid-19 crisis in his state - an anti-lockdown approach applauded by many Republicans.\n\nHe defended his reforms of Florida's education system, saying his state \"chose facts over fear, education over indoctrination, law and order over rioting and disorder\".\n\nLater, speaking on Fox News, Mr DeSantis outlined more specific pledges including declaring an emergency at the country's southern border on day one in the White House. He also pledged to fire FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, and slash President Joe Biden's \"anti-American energy policies\".\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr DeSantis confirmed he would seek the Republican presidential nomination, registering with the Federal Election Commission before releasing a stylised announcement video.\n\n\"Our border is a disaster, crime infests our cities... and the president flounders,\" he says in the video. \"But decline is a choice, success is attainable, and freedom is worth fighting for.\"\n\nMr Trump and his campaign greeted Mr DeSantis's much anticipated arrival into the 2024 field with a barrage of emails and posts to Truth Social, the former president's social media platform.\n\nSoon after the governor told Mr Musk he would study the US Constitution to \"see what buttons can I push\" to invoke executive authority, Mr Trump released a statement addressing Mr DeSantis directly.\n\n\"'Rob,' My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!), yours does not! (per my conversation with Kim Jung Un, of North Korea, soon to become my friend!),\" Mr Trump wrote.\n\nThe latest survey from Morning Consult - published last week, before Mr DeSantis's announcement - has him a distant second behind Mr Trump, with a 38-point margin.\n\nThrough a lengthy primary process beginning early next year, Republican voters will decide which candidate will face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 2024 general election.\n\nAnd Florida's last legislative session cleared a potential \"resign-to-run\" hurdle for Mr DeSantis's candidacy after it passed a bill that ensures he does not have to leave the governor's mansion to run for the presidency.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis\n\nMr DeSantis will also have the benefit of a formidable war chest. At the end of last month, he had $88m (\u00a371m) in a fund left over from his Florida re-election campaign that can be transferred to his White House bid.\n\nHe also reportedly has about $30m controlled by an independent committee that his allies can use to support his campaign.\n\nMr Trump, by contrast, reported a combined $18.8m in fundraising over the first three months of 2023.\n\nMr DeSantis is expected to tap Generra Peck to serve as his campaign manager. Ms Peck, Mr DeSantis's top political adviser, led the daily operations of the governor's 2022 re-election campaign, guiding him to a nearly 20-point victory.\n\nAnd hiring is already under way for DeSantis campaign bases in at least 18 states, according to reporting from the Associated Press and the New York Times.", "Children conceived as a result of rape will soon be recognised as victims of crime in England and Wales, the government says. Here, people share their stories of being born to mothers who were raped - and explain why they refuse to let the past dictate their lives.\n\nYou are now 10 days old but when you read this you may be much older.\n\nTasnim feels her eyes sting with tears as she reads her mum Lucy's diary for the first time. She had no idea the journal existed, let alone survived the fire that killed Lucy when Tasnim was just a baby.\n\nA faint burn mark on Tasnim's cheek is the only visible scar of what happened that night. As the flames engulfed the house, Tasnim's dad had carried her to safety, wrapped in a blanket and placed her under an apple tree in the garden.\n\nHe saved her life - but he was the one who had poured the petrol and lit the blaze, which also killed Tasnim's aunt and grandmother.\n\nTasnim always knew her dad was a convicted murderer serving life in prison.\n\nBut the diary - which lay forgotten in police storage for 18 years until Tasnim asked to see the evidence files in her mum's case - contains another devastating revelation.\n\nAs Tasnim reads, it dawns on her that she was born as a result of her father sexually abusing her mum.\n\nLucy, from Telford, Shropshire, was just 15 years old when she died\n\nAlongside Lucy's hopes and dreams for the future, the pages detail her secret suffering. She had been groomed and abused from the age of 12 by Tasnim's father, taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood, who was 10 years Lucy's senior.\n\nThe truth leaves Tasnim reeling. She feels as if she is the only person in the world going through this. But research suggests she is far from the only one.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Tasnim tells her story the documentary Out of the Shadows: Born From Rape, available in the UK on BBC iPlayer\n\nIt is difficult to say how many people in the UK are born from rape and abuse, but estimates by Durham University and the Centre for Women's Justice suggest up to 3,300 women may have become pregnant as a result of rape in England and Wales in 2021 alone.\n\nThe forthcoming Victims Bill covering England and Wales will officially classify children conceived as a result of rape as victims of crime, the government says. This will, according to ministers, entitle them to extra support - including therapy and counselling as well as access to information about their case. They are also promised \"greater recognition\" from services around alcohol and drug dependency, education and housing benefit.\n\nBut with no charities or support services dedicated to the children of rape victims in the UK, those like Tasnim have often been left to navigate complicated emotions without specialist help.\n\nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line.\n\n\"You want to imagine that your parents are happily in love,\" she says.\n\n\"It alters everything you know, and how you perceive things about your family and about yourself. Because I'm related to a murderer, and also a rapist. And I used to think horrible things like, what if I grow up to be like him?\"\n\nSome of the diary is too painful for Tasnim to read. She tries to focus on the love for her that is so clear in Lucy's diary. Its pages are full of poems and stories of their life together.\n\n\"I shouldn't feel bad about myself, because she wouldn't want that,\" Tasnim says.\n\nGrowing up adopted in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, Neil - who uses they/them pronouns - had a happy childhood, but was always curious about their birth mother. They pictured a fairytale princess and dreamed they would one day be reunited.\n\nNow, at the age of 27, Neil opens the letter from the private detective they hired to find her. But as they read, it feels as though a chasm is opening up and they are in free fall.\n\nNeil's mother was raped by a stranger in a park when she was a teenager. Neil was born as a result.\n\n\"Nothing can prepare you for those words,\" Neil says.\n\nFinding out they had been conceived in such a violent, hateful way feels, \"almost like somebody's punched into your chest and ripped your insides out\".\n\nNeil adds: \"You feel shame, you feel grief, you feel confusion. All the darkest, most awful feelings you can have about yourself. And I just broke down.\"\n\nEverything Neil thought they knew about themself has been ripped away. They cannot look in the mirror, fearing the face of the unknown attacker is looking back.\n\nWhat does it mean to be born from violence, not love? And will Neil's birth mother ever be willing to meet?\n\nTasnim feels her heart pounding in her chest as the heavy prison door slams shut behind her. A guard leads her into a small, cold room. A table and two chairs are waiting.\n\nA door on the other side of the room opens and Tasnim sees her father for the first time. Dressed in a grey prison tracksuit, he is shorter than she imagined.\n\nAzhar Ali Mehmood was jailed in 2001 for three counts of murder and one of attempted murder\n\nBut his demeanour is large. It fills the room. He hugs her. He has bought her a chocolate cake. To \"celebrate\".\n\nThis is not what Tasnim wanted. She wanted to be the one in control. She wanted him to understand the impact of what he did.\n\nBut now she sees for herself the man who manipulated and controlled her mother.\n\nTasnim walks away from the prison and never goes back. She has all the answers she needs.\n\nWaiting outside the train station to meet their birth mother for the first time, Neil's stomach is doing nervous somersaults. They have thought so many times about this moment, rehearsing what to do and what to say.\n\nAs soon as she appears, Neil knows it is her.\n\nThe two look into each other's eyes. Neil feels just as anxious on her behalf.\n\n\"If I look like the man who did that to you,\" Neil says, \"I'll walk away now.\"\n\n\"You don't,\" their mother says, and Neil feels a huge weight lift from their shoulders.\n\nMother and son walk and talk, tentatively sharing the stories of their lives. She talks about family, the half-siblings Neil didn't know they had. The two of them have the same expressions, same gestures, the same laugh.\n\nNeil does not ask about what happened the night they were conceived. They do not need to know and do not want to put her through that. As far as they are concerned, Neil has no birth father.\n\nNeil has a birth mother and that is enough.\n\nSammy turns to look at her eldest son sitting next to her in the car. She wants to help him, to protect him from this pain, but she doesn't know how.\n\n\"No,\" she says. \"You're my baby.\"\n\nThe year is 2013, and Sammy has only recently explained to her 12-year-old son the truth about what happened and how he was conceived - how the man he called dad, Arshid Hussain, had raped and abused her from when she was 14. He groomed her to believe they were in a relationship. Hussain, who was 24, did the same to many other girls too.\n\nBut Sammy is finally free from the fog of his control. She has begun speaking out about the failure of services to protect her, and more than 1,000 other children, from sexual exploitation in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.\n\nHussain is being investigated by police, and Sammy's son's DNA is part of the evidence against him.\n\nBut Sammy can see how much her son is struggling with what it all means. He is questioning everything - was he wanted? Was he loved?\n\nThe case is all over the national news. It is all so public and they feel so alone.\n\nSammy has tried to be the best mum she can, but she feels like it is all her fault.\n\nShe slumps down on the kitchen floor and cries. She loves her son so much, but she feels like he would be better off without her.\n\nLike Tasnim and Neil, Sammy struggles for years alone without anyone knowing how she feels.\n\nIt is only in 2021, when she meets another mother - Mandy - that she finally is able to talk freely with someone who truly understands.\n\nBy now, Hussain is serving a 35-year jail sentence. Sammy is sitting at Mandy's kitchen table in Halifax, with Mandy's dog Toffee curled up under her chair. Mandy tells Sammy her story. It is still painful, even after 30 years.\n\nMandy's first memory of the abuse was when she was 11. Her father, respected in the community as a police special constable and Salvation Army member, had undressed and got into the bath with her.\n\nFrom then on it was every other night. He would tiptoe into her bedroom. Mandy did not dare tell anyone. He was terrifying and she felt trapped.\n\nThen one day she realised she was pregnant.\n\n\"It's like if you inject poison into somebody. That's what my father did to me, he injected our own genes into me,\" she tells Sammy. She didn't know what to do.\n\nBut when her father found out, Mandy was not left with a choice. She would have the child, and it would call him Daddy.\n\nHer father was there in the delivery room when she gave birth. The midwives passed her newborn son to him.\n\n\"That just destroyed me. He held my child first,\" Mandy says. \"I was just thinking, 'Get your hands off him, keep away.'\n\n\"He was my baby, he was precious. I was going to protect him forever.\"\n\nSo when Mandy saw her chance, she put some nappies and baby milk in the pram, walked out the door, and never went back.\n\nSammy asks her if she thinks it is different having a child conceived through abuse, compared with a child born from a happy relationship.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mandy says. \"He wasn't conceived out of love. He wasn't conceived out of my love. He was conceived by a monster.\n\nMandy's son was formally adopted by her husband Pete. They now live happily together with their other children.\n\nBut although Mandy escaped her father's abuse, she couldn't escape the consequences. Her son was born with a genetic disability.\n\nThirty years on, she still cares for him 24 hours a day. He loves his PlayStation and wrestling. He doesn't have the capacity to understand that he was born from abuse, and Mandy is grateful she hasn't had to explain. But it has affected his whole life.\n\n\"I always say I'm the survivor, my son's the victim,\" Mandy tells Sammy.\n\n\"He didn't ask to be born that way. Because a crime happened to me, it happened to him too.\"\n\nUntil she and Sammy found each other, both felt they were on their own.\n\n\"What Mandy has shown me is that no matter what you go through, you can move forward and be happy,\" says Sammy. \"People need to talk about this.\"\n\nFinally, campaigners say, the issue is being brought into the spotlight. The government's proposed reforms in the Victims Bill - dubbed \"Daisy's law\" after a campaigner who was born after a rape in the 1970s - are long overdue, activists say.\n\nFor Neil and Tasnim, the planned changes are also an acknowledgement that voices like theirs are finally being heard.\n\nAnd they hope speaking out will show others conceived by rape they are not alone.\n\n\"There is a lot of stigma, but there shouldn't be,\" says Tasnim. \"It's not about who you're related to, I'm my own person. And it's not my fault. I was just affected by it.\"\n\nTalking openly is her way of keeping her mum's memory alive. Their story was not destined to be a tragic one, Tasnim believes.\n\n\"I suppose if I could speak to my mum, I'd want her to know how brave she was,\" Tasnim says.\n\n\"And just to tell her everything's OK. I'm OK.\"\n\nOut of the Shadows: Born From Rape\n\nSammy had her son after she was abused as a child. Now she's on a journey to meet other mothers and children born from rape - and confront the questions no one dares ask.", "Murray Foote has spoken out for the first time since resigning as the SNP's head of communications\n\nThe SNP's former spin doctor has said he is willing to bet that the police investigation into the party's finances will not result in any charges.\n\nMurray Foote, who quit in March amid a row over membership figures, speculated the probe could be \"wild goose chase\" and branded it a \"grotesque spectacle\".\n\nThe SNP's former chief executive, Peter Murrell, and ex-treasurer Colin Beattie were arrested as part of the inquiry.\n\nBoth were released without charge pending further investigation.\n\nOfficers also spent two days searching the Glasgow home of Mr Murrell and his wife - former first minister Nicola Sturgeon - and the party's headquarters in Edinburgh.\n\nA forensic tent was erected outside the house and several boxes of items were removed from both properties in the high-profile operation last month.\n\nA luxury motorhome was also seized from outside the Dunfermline home of Mr Murrell's mother.\n\nMr Foote stood down as head of communications for the SNP after the party provided inaccurate membership figures to the media during its leadership election, saying he had passed them on in \"good faith\".\n\nHe had ridiculed newspaper reports, which later turned out to be true, that the party had lost 30,000 members.\n\nThe former Daily Record editor wrote in the newspaper on Thursday that he was prepared to bet \u00a35 on there being no charges after the ongoing Police Scotland investigation into the SNP's finances is concluded.\n\nThe probe, known as Operation Branchform, was launched in July 2021 following complaints about how more than \u00a3600,000 of donations for a future independence referendum were used.\n\nMr Foote described the sight of forensic tents outside of the home of the former first minister as \"extraordinary\" and a \"grotesque circus\".\n\nMr Foote described the police search of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell's home as a \"grotesque circus\"\n\nHe added: \"Given the grim spectacle at the house Peter Murrell shares with Nicola Sturgeon and at the party HQ, it's inconceivable the authorities would be so cavalier without slam dunk evidence, right?\"\n\nBut he went on to compare the situation to the Rangers case, where more than \u00a350m in compensation has been paid out after several people involved in the administration and acquisition of the football club were wrongly prosecuted.\n\nMr Foote said: \"The authorities have previous for high-profile inquiries collapsing in scandal. If they have spectacularly misjudged this one too, then the reputational cost will be far more substantial than the cash spent on manpower\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm not saying Branchform is a wild goose chase - but what if it is? Surely it's worth considering.\n\n\"Actually, if we cherish the presumption of innocence, then a no charges outcome must be at least considered. And the fallout would have serious consequences for the investigating authorities.\"\n\nWhile Mr Foote said police had a duty to investigate complaints, he said you would \"struggle to meet two less likely master criminals\" than Mr Beattie and Mr Murrell.\n\nHe wrote: \"Firstly, Peter's loyalty to his wife is unquestionable. First minister Sturgeon and her husband lived under crushingly intense scrutiny.\n\n\"It is inconceivable to me that Peter would so much as consider doing something dodgy lest it rebound and put his wife in jeopardy.\"\n\nThe police investigation of the SNP's finances is, as you might expect, the subject of intense discussion in political circles.\n\nYou can't walk through Holyrood's garden lobby without bumping into someone who wants to gossip, speculate or stroke their chin about it.\n\nBut when speaking out in public, most are pretty careful. That is sensible, given it's an active police case, subject to Contempt of Court rules.\n\nThose rules mean you shouldn't publish anything which could endanger any future court case. But they do not mean you are sworn to total silence.\n\nIt has become an easy get-out for politicians of all stripes to insist that they can't say a single word about anything the police might be looking in to.\n\nAs a former newspaper editor, Murray Foote knows his way around the difficulties and risks in this area better than most.\n\nHe obviously has a certain perspective, having recently worked as a SNP spin doctor - but perhaps his willingness to put his money where his mouth is will encourage more in the political sphere to start speaking their minds.\n\nNicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell held the two most senior positions within the SNP\n\nMr Foote forecast a potential surge in SNP membership if the party is cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nHe also attacked the Scottish Conservatives, branding them the \"real party of corruption\" and accusing them of exploiting the situation.\n\nTory MSP Annie Wells said the \"highly speculative\" Daily Record article showed Mr Foote was still happy to spin for the SNP.\n\nShe said his faith in Mr Murrell's character will \"raise a few eyebrows\" given the former chief executive took responsibility for misleading the public over membership figures before resigning.\n\nMr Foote resigned from his role as the SNP's media chief after describing press reports that the party's membership had dropped by 30,000 as \"inaccurate\" and \"drivel\".\n\nThe SNP subsequently confirmed that membership had fallen to from 104,000 to 72,186 since 2021.\n\nMr Foote said he issued agreed party responses to the media which \"created a serious impediment\" to his role.\n\nThe SNP raised \u00a3666,953 through referendum-related appeals between 2017 and 2020 with a pledge to spend these funds on the independence campaign.\n\nQuestions were raised after its accounts showed it had just under \u00a397,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about \u00a3272,000.\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has rejected calls for Mr Murrell and Ms Sturgeon to be suspended from the party.\n\nHe said Mr Beattie's arrest was \"clearly a very serious matter indeed\" but he had not been suspended from the party as \"people are innocent until proven guilty\".", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. The PM says the UK is heading towards net zero in a \"proportionate and pragmatic way\u201d.\n\nRishi Sunak has promised not to \"unnecessarily\" add costs and \"hassle\" to households to hit climate targets.\n\nThe prime minister said he remained committed to achieving net zero by 2050 but any new measures would have to be \"proportionate and pragmatic\".\n\nSome of his MPs are demanding a rethink on green policies.\n\nIt comes after an unexpected Tory by-election win based on a campaign against the extension of London's clean-air zone.\n\nThe Conservative candidate in Uxbridge and South Ruislip opposed Labour mayor Sadiq Khan's plan to enlarge the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez), under which owners of more polluting cars have to pay a daily charge.\n\nLabour, which had been expected to take the outer London constituency, blamed its defeat on Ulez and suggested it could now rethink the expansion policy.\n\nThe result has reignited debates over the cost and pace of measures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former business secretary, has called on the government to scrap plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 and rethink new rules for energy certificates.\n\n\"The lesson from Uxbridge is that there are things we can change that will be electorally successful,\" he said on Sunday.\n\nDanny Kruger, the co-leader of a new group of right-wing Tory MPs, also called over the weekend for a \"rethink about the pace and the mechanism of the change we all want to see\".\n\n\"We need a transition that is affordable and particularly affordable for working families, he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.\n\nAsked whether he would resist backbench pressure on the issue from his MPs, Mr Sunak replied he was \"standing up for the British people\" at a time of rising living costs.\n\n\"That's having an impact on households' and families' bills - and I don't want to do anything to add to that, I want to make it easier,\" he added.\n\n\"We're going to make progress towards net zero, but we're going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic way that doesn't unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their life.\"\n\nLow-traffic neighbourhoods aim to reduce motor traffic, but have proved controversial with motorists\n\nThe comments come after other ministers suggested a change in approach on some green policies in recent weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove said the government should relax a deadline for landlords to achieve new energy efficiency targets, adding that ministers were \"asking too much too quickly\".\n\nEarlier this month, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he has ended government funding for low-traffic neighbourhoods, and called for councils to look again at unpopular zones in their areas.\n\nThe Times has reported that ministers are considering cutting off councils' access to the national number plate database used to enforce the schemes.\n\nThe newspaper also reported they are considering an \"Aston Martin exemption\" to the 2030 car sales deadline, under which smaller carmakers would be given longer to switch to electric vehicles.\n\nMr Sunak's commitment to green policies was recently questioned by Lord Zac Goldsmith, who quit as a Foreign Office Minister last month and attacked the PM's \"apathy\" over climate change.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Sunak said reaching net zero - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - was \"important to me\".\n\nHe added that the UK should be proud of its record in this area, adding it was \"better than the vast majority of other countries that we're compared to\".\n\nShadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy said the Uxbridge by-election had sent a \"very clear message\" to Labour that the cost of living was \"really biting for people\".\n\nShe added that pressures on living costs had \"worsened\" since schemes such as Ulez were designed, adding: \"We will respond to that, and will reflect on that\".\n\n\"We're absolutely committed to cleaning up our air, but we've got to make sure we do this in a way that is helpful, and affordable for people who are currently are really struggling,\" she added.", "President Emmanuel Macron of France will be the host for the King's first symbolic overseas trip of his reign\n\nThe first state visits of the reign of King Charles are going to be to France and Germany, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nKing Charles and Camilla the Queen Consort will travel to the countries on a visit from 26 to 31 March.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France will host a state banquet for the royal couple at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nIn Germany, the King will be the first British sovereign to address the Bundestag, the German parliament.\n\nThe royal couple will also visit memorials to Allied bombing in Hamburg and to young Jewish refugees who fled the Nazis.\n\nAs head of state, the King's official visits are decided on government advice -

the Royal Yacht Britannia.\n\nHe travelled with his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, his late father the Duke of Edinburgh and his then 10-year-old sister, Princess Anne.\n\nIt was to be the first of 39 trips to Northern Ireland as heir to the throne.\n\nHis parents had arrived for a two-day tour, packed full of formal engagements at town halls and locals businesses.\n\nBut while the Queen carried out her official duties, the royal children were largely kept away from the cameras.\n\nInstead, Prince Charles and his little sister had afternoon tea at a County Down estate and enjoyed a picnic on a private island, where a hungry Labrador stole their bodyguard's lunch.\n\nThe 1961 papers were intrigued by the prince's daytrip to a County Down island\n\nTight security measures have been a feature of royal visits since the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, but back in 1961, the Royal Family's schedule could be publicised days in advance.\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph published an almost minute-by-minute guide of the Queen's itinerary, pointing out the best locations to see the monarch's motorcade.\n\nThere was great excitement ahead of what was her first visit for seven years, and only her third tour as reigning monarch.\n\nIn a rain-soaked Carrickfergus, an armada of little boats owned by well-wishers greeted the Royal Family, while hundreds of cheering spectators lined the town's harbour.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II disembarks from the royal barge at Carrickfergus in 1961\n\nThe Queen and the Duke disembarked for a tour of Carrickfergus Castle, but unlike their parents' itinerary, the younger royals' travel plans were not pre-announced.\n\n\"The children's destination had been kept secret at the Queen's wishes, right until the last minute,\" the Belfast Telegraph reported.\n\nPrince Charles and his sister were brought ashore at Belfast and driven to Rademon Estate on the outskirts of Crossgar, County Down.\n\nThe 500-acre estate was then home to the aptly-named King family who were long-standing friends of the Windsors.\n\nJames Osborne King was a prominent estate agent and his wife, the Hon Elizabeth Patricia King (n\u00e9e White), was a childhood friend of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Queen was also godmother to the couple's eldest child, 14-year-old Elizabeth Lavinia Sarah King.\n\nThe late Queen, then known as Princess Elizabeth, attended baby Lavinia King's baptism in Comber, County Down, in 1946\n\nMrs King was descended from the Spencer family, sharing ancestry with Lady Diana Spencer -

a small, uninhabited land mass off the lough's western shore.\n\nFew people spotted the heir to the throne tucking into his packed lunch, but in the days that followed, \"scores of holidaymakers\" flocked to the island to explore the royal picnic spot.\n\nPawle Island, pictured here in June 2020, briefly became a tourist attraction after the 1961 royal picnic\n\nTwenty years later, ahead of Prince Charles's wedding to Lady Diana, Sir Richard regaled the Belfast Telegraph with his memories of the Pawle Island picnic.\n\n\"I had brought Bracken, my Labrador, with me and the prince had his detective with him, a big fellow who must have been all of 20 stones,\" Sir Richard recalled.\n\n\"The detective decided he would go and find himself some beer and he went off, leaving his lunch on the stone where he had been sitting.\n\n\"Bracken, as soon as his back was turned, promptly went across and ate it.\"\n\nSir Richard said the young prince found the case of the stolen sandwiches \"very funny\" and the pair laughed about it when they met again in later life.\n\nThe 1961 visit was the King's only childhood trip to Northern Ireland and 18 years passed before he came back for a second tour.\n\nDuring that period, the security situation in Northern Ireland deteriorated markedly.\n\nThe Troubles began in the late 1960s and Prince Charles was 31 years old by the time he returned to Northern Ireland in 1979.\n\nPrince Charles's second visit to Northern Ireland in 1979 had a very different tone to his first\n\nHe arrived three months after the IRA killed 18 soldiers in a bomb attack at Narrow Water, County Down.\n\nThe paramilitary group also killed his own great uncle and beloved mentor, Lord Mountbatten, in a bombing in the Republic of Ireland on the same day.\n\nPrince Charles spent his 1979 visit meeting soldiers at various barracks close to the border, which had been the target of regular IRA attacks.\n\nThe peace process began to take hold in the 1990s and Prince Charles soon became a regular guest of Northern Ireland and an occasional visitor to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAt a St Patrick's Day dinner four years ago, he revealed his lifetime ambition to visit all 32 counties on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn a speech to guests, he said he had already ticked 15 off the list at that stage.\n\n\"I am quite determined, before I drop dead and finally lose my marbles, that I should get around to the remaining 17,\" he added.", "Padam Padam is the star's 52nd top 40 hit in the UK\n\nKylie Minogue has scored her biggest solo hit in more than a decade with the infectious dance anthem Padam Padam.\n\nIt's the star's first song to break into the UK top 10 since All The Lovers peaked at number three in 2010.\n\nThat means Kylie is one of only four women to reach the UK's top 10 in five separate decades, alongside Cher, Lulu and Diana Ross.\n\nThe singer said the success of the song, which has gone viral on TikTok, had \"really taken us all by surprise\".\n\n\"I can't even, I can't even, full stop!\" she told Zoe Ball on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show earlier this week. \"We loved it as a team, but the way that it's taken off is way beyond me.\"\n\nThe song has been steadily climbing the chart since entering at number 26 four weeks ago.

People had not necessarily sought clinical help or a diagnosis at this point.\n\nThe research team, including academics from King's College London and University College London (UCL), say the rise in reports needs to be urgently addressed.\n\nDr Leonie Brose, from King's, said: \"The last three years have seen an unprecedented series of events that can be seen to be contributing to a worsening in people's mental health - a pandemic, a cost of living crisis, and a healthcare crisis.\n\n\"Our study shows that England's wellbeing is steadily getting worse.\n\n\"What's required now is a strategy that puts equality, wellbeing and sustainability at the heart of society's response.\"\n\nThe monthly telephone survey was conducted between April 2020 and December 2022 and involved some 51,800 adults in total.\n\nEach month, a new group of adults were asked how often in the last 30 days they had experienced a number of negative feelings such as worthlessness or hopelessness, feeling nervous or feeling so depressed nothing could cheer them up.\n\nParticipants were asked to rate their feelings on a five-point scale, with higher scores placing them in the severe category.\n\nOverall, the proportion of people reporting severe distress increased from 5.7% to 8.3%, with some groups affected more than others, including participants from low-income backgrounds.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of adults reporting any distress was about a third during this time - it dipped to 28% in May 2021 and rose back to 32% by the end of that year.\n\nCommenting on the study, Prof Sir Simon Wessely, at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, King's College London, said: \"The strength of this study is that it is large, population based, and can look at trends over time.\n\n\"Overall it suggests that what one might call normal feelings of distress, unhappiness or anxiety that probably do not require or indeed receive professional help have not changed much in recent years.\n\n\"But there has been a definite increase in more severe levels of distress, some of which may reach what we call \"clinical\" levels, in which some form of assessment, most likely in primary care, might be indicated.\n\n\"Of particular concern is that this is seen most in young people, confirmed by other studies.\"\n\nDr Michael Bloomfield, at UCL, said it was \"particularly concerning\" that the high levels of distress were \"most marked during young adulthood\", adding that this was a key period of development \"and this may represent elevated risk of subsequent mental health problems\".\n\nHe said: \"A mentally healthy adult population is in everyone's interests.

and Burnley will now look to secure the title, break the 100-point barrier and become the first team to go unbeaten at home in a Championship season since Newcastle United in 2009-10.\n\nGiven the amount of change that Kompany has overseen since taking charge it was somewhat ironic that it was a combination of two players who were there when he took over that gave them the lead.\n\nBrownhill's low strike from the edge of the area might have been going in anyway but 33-year-old Barnes, who has now won promotion to the Premier League three times with the club, stuck out a foot to redirect it and leave Boro keeper Zack Steffen with no chance.\n\nBarnes said after the game that he would be leaving the Clarets in the summer after nine years, saying it was \"the end of an era\" and it was \"time for him to move on\".\n\nTella missed a gilt-edged chance to double their lead before the break when he fired wide after being played in behind the home defence.\n\nAkpom's 27th goal of the season brought Michael Carrick's men back into it and they enjoyed a spell of dominance thereafter.\n\nHowever, they could not create another real chance of note and were opened up by a pass into the inside right channel that Tella latched on to, before putting it on a plate for former Boro loanee Roberts to score.\n\nAkpom had a chance in the last minute to delay the Burnley celebrations for a few days at least but he headed wide at the back post.\n\nThere was a sour note when Clarets midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson was struck by a coin thrown from the Middlesbrough end during the celebrations of the league leaders' second goal.\n\nSuccessive defeats for the Teessiders means they will almost certainly have to go through the play-offs if they are to join Burnley in the Premier League next season.\n\n\"Credit to them firstly, I have to say congratulations.

That number has now fallen to just 16, according to the local council.\n\nThe city appears to be bucking the national trend, with the total number of people estimated to be rough sleeping across England on the rise again, after a drop during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe issue hit the headlines this week, when Home Secretary Suella Braverman's claim that some people were living on the streets as a \"lifestyle choice\" provoked a backlash from homelessness charities, as well as some Conservatives.\n\nShe has proposed restricting the use of tents by rough sleepers, for example by issuing fines to those who refuse to move from shop doorways or charities that supply tents to people identified by police as having caused a nuisance.\n\nEmily Darlington, a Labour councillor in Milton Keynes and the cabinet member for housing, says \"tents are just the symptom, they're not the cause\".\n\n\"There's no point in just dealing with the symptom, it's like you just want to hide away the problem.\"\n\nShe argues people that sleep in tents think they have no other option \"because public services or the voluntary sector have failed them\".\n\nIn Milton Keynes, Ms Darlington says the key to preventing people falling through the cracks has been bringing emergency beds and other support services under one roof.\n\nDuring the pandemic, councils across England received government funding to help get people off the streets and into emergency accommodation including then-empty hotels, as part of the Everyone In scheme.\n\nThe initiative was widely praised but charities were also concerned many people were not found permanent homes.\n\nMs Darlington, who is also Labour's parliamentary candidate for Milton Keynes Central at the next general election, says putting people in hotels was only \"a sticking plaster\" and the council wanted to keep people off the streets for good.\n\nIn April 2022 the council opened its own shelter for rough sleepers at the city's old bus station, providing emergency beds for up to 19 people every night.\n\nCrucially, on the ground floor of the building there is also access to GP, mental health and addiction services. Meanwhile, charities provide help setting up bank accounts, accessing benefits and finding housing, as well as hot meals, a hairdresser and laundry facilities.\n\n\"So it's not asking people to run around the city, try and make appointments, when they already lead super chaotic lives,\" Ms Darlington explains.\n\nEmily Darlington is the council cabinet member responsible for homelessness in Milton Keynes\n\nAt the shelter, those signing in for the night have faced issues including addiction, relationship breakdown and eviction, which contributed to them ending up on the streets.\n\nJoseph, a recovering drug addict, says he became homeless when he was evicted after complaining about the condition of his housing.\n\nSince then the 35-year-old has been sleeping rough on and off for several months.\n\nSo what does he make of the home secretary's comment that sleeping on the streets is a \"lifestyle choice\" for some?\n\n\"Wow,\" he says. \"My reaction to that would be try and live one day like that.\"\n\nPausing for a moment he reflects that perhaps some people do have other options, but adds: \"I had no choice. I had to.\"\n\nJoseph has used the shelter at the old bus station\n\nAs a rough sleeper, he has had to contend with not only the cold but also violence.\n\n\"Yesterday a guy came over and stamped on my head. It's constant,\" he says. \"And it's like you don't even sleep. It is rest but you're literally just lying there.\"\n\nHe also developed problems with alcohol \"because it's the only thing that keeps you warm outside\".\n\nJoseph says the system hasn't been perfect for him and he's struggled to access intensive support for his addictions.\n\nBut he still thinks the help offered by the shelter is crucial.\n\n\"If this place weren't here, people would die, literally.\"\n\nThe shelter has 19 beds available for rough sleepers\n\nSince the shelter opened, 145 people who have stayed there have been helped to move into long-term accommodation.\n\nMs Darlington recognises the problem is not solved and there are still some people sleeping rough in Milton Keynes. She says many of these individuals face significant challenges with addiction or mental health issues and continue to be visited daily by outreach workers.\n\n\"Some people aren't ready to face their issues, they're not ready to face their addictions... If we force them to participate in things before they're ready, we are just setting them up to fail,\" she says.\n\n\"I don't want to pretend like in Milton Keynes it's all easy and everyone's problems are sorted overnight - they're not. But it's the persistence of working over time with individuals, getting to know them.\"\n\nJohnny Luk, who is the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Milton Keynes Central, said at a council level there was cross-party support for the work being done to tackle rough sleeping locally.\n\nHowever, he said government funding had been \"pivotal\" in enabling progress, with more than \u00a310m given to the council to address homelessness since 2019.\n\nMr Luk said he would not describe sleeping on the streets as a \"lifestyle choice\".\n\n\"I prefer we positively support homeless people, who are members of our community and deserve empathy and support under complex circumstances, rather than create a new offence or give fines,\" he added.\n\nDowning Street has said no-one should be criminalised for having nowhere to live and it wants to ensure vulnerable people get support, whilst cracking down on anti-social and intimidating behaviour.\n\nEmma Johnson says her charity is seeing an increase in demand for its services\n\nEmma Johnson is the general manager of local homelessness charity UnityMK, which runs support services on the ground floor below the council shelter, alongside other agencies like the NHS.\n\nShe says strong partnerships between voluntary organisations and the council have been key to tackling rough sleeping in Milton Keynes.\n\nHowever, Ms Johnson is concerned the charity is seeing an increase in demand from rough sleepers, as well as others in temporary accommodation or facing homelessness.\n\nShe says this includes some people who are working but end up on the streets due to family breakdown, mental health crises and the high cost of renting.\n\nOfficial figures suggest a slight increase in rough sleeping in Milton Keynes after the end of the pandemic-era Everyone In scheme, but the council says numbers have now fallen again.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people living in temporary accommodation in the city is amongst the highest in England, according to research by charity Shelter.\n\n\"I think there is just not enough social housing to be able to move people on,\" Ms Johnson says. \"Social housing has to become a priority for whoever's going to be in government.\"\n\nAn independent commission has said the government will not meet its own target to end rough sleeping by 2024, with a severe shortage of affordable housing, a lack of support services and the cost-of-living crisis pushing more people into homelessness.\n\n\"I think there will always be people that find themselves homeless,\" says Ms Johnson. \"So it's about trying to create a pathway to pick people up as quickly as possible.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Marius Draghici is sentenced for his role in the killing of 39 people found in Essex\n\nA people trafficker has been jailed for 12 years and seven months over the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants who died in a lorry container.\n\nMarius Draghici, 50, from Romania, admitted 39 counts of manslaughter and one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.\n\nThe bodies were discovered on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, in October 2019.\n\nThe Old Bailey heard conditions in the trailer must have been \"unspeakable\".\n\nMarius Draghici was referred to as the \"right-hand man\" to one of the ringleaders\n\nThe judge, Mr Justice Garnham, said Draghici \"was a small but essential cog in the wheels of this criminal conspiracy\" that \"put would-be migrants at risk of death\".\n\nHe was also sentenced to four years and two months in prison for the unlawful immigration offence, to be served concurrently.\n\nThe bodies were discovered in the refrigerated trailer on 23 October 2019\n\nDraghici was in charge of the migrants' onward transportation in the UK - acting as a driver - and prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC described him as the \"right hand man\" to one of the ringleaders, Gheorghe Nica.\n\nFellow Romanian Nica, of Basildon, Essex, is one of four men already convicted of manslaughter - and one of 11 in total now jailed in connection with the deaths.\n\nThe victims included 28 men, eight women and three children varying between the ages of 15 and 44.\n\nThey had paid a fee of \u00a310,000, rising to \u00a313,000, for what was promised as a \"VIP\" route to Europe and the hope of better-paid work.\n\nThe migrants travelled on 22 October, 2019, from Paris to Bierne, a town in northern France, where they were then seen being taken by taxis to a shed on an isolated farm.\n\nThey later clambered into a lorry, which was seen on CCTV footage making its way across France towards the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, where it was loaded onto a ferry bound for Purfleet-on-Thames, Essex.\n\nTemperatures rose to 38.5C (101F) in the container, by which point oxygen levels had slumped and the air was too toxic for human life.\n\nThey suffocated to death, dying from asphyxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nMany of the victims hoped to find better paid work in the UK\n\nAudio recordings from the victims' final voice messages to loved ones were played to the Old Bailey, which the judge described as \"pitiful\".\n\nThe HGV driver Maurice Robinson, of Craigavon, County Armagh, opened the trailer up on the industrial estate in the early hours of 23 October and discovered their bodies - before eventually calling 999.\n\nDraghici fled the country but was eventually detained in the Romanian capital Bucharest before being extradited in late 2022.\n\nHe admitted to having been at the isolated Collingwood Farm in Orsett, Essex, where migrants were dropped off during previous trafficking operations on 11 and 18 October.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

There was at this stage no evidence to suggest a foreign state was involved, they said.\n\nRussian gas deliveries had been suspended before the blasts. Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in August last year, saying it needed maintenance. Nord Stream 2 had never been put into service.\n\nThe exact cause of the 26 September blasts that hit the natural gas pipelines is unknown, but it is widely believed they were attacked.\n\nNato and Western leaders have stopped short of directly accusing Russia of attacking its own pipelines, although the EU has previously said Russia uses its gas pipelines as a weapon against the West.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times reported that new intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group had carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.\n\nCiting anonymous US officials, the report said there was no evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation.\n\nThe US newspaper reported that the officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or \"any details of the strength of the evidence it contains\".\n\nIt added: \"Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two.\"\n\nResponding to the New York Times report, Mr Podolyak added that Kyiv had no information about what had happened.\n\nMeanwhile, German website Die Zeit reported that German authorities had made a breakthrough in their investigation into the cause of the attacks.\n\nAccording to joint research by several German media organisations, the boat used to plant the explosives was a yacht hired from a firm based in Poland, which reportedly belonged to two Ukrainians. The nationalities of those who carried out the attack were unclear.\n\nGerman investigators later refused to confirm details of the report but said that a ship had been searched seven weeks ago.\n\nDefence Minister Boris Pistorius warned against jumping to conclusions. It could be a false-flag operation aimed at pinning the blame on pro-Ukrainian groups, he told German radio: \"The likelihood of one [theory] or the other is just as high.\"\n\nAt least 50m (164ft) of the underwater Nord Stream 1 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany is thought to have been destroyed by September's blast.\n\nDanish police believe \"powerful explosions\" blew four holes in the pipe and its newer twin, Nord Stream 2.\n\nGerman, Danish and Swedish authorities have all been investigating the incident.\n\nMr Peskov said Nord Stream shareholder countries should insist on an urgent, transparent investigation.\n\n\"We are still not allowed in the investigation,\" he said. \"Only a few days ago we received notes to that effect from the Danes and Swedes. This whole thing is not just weird. It reeks of a heinous crime.\"\n\nFor decades, Russia supplied huge amounts of natural gas to Western Europe.

Only after Bairstow's stunning grab in the evening session did the Old Trafford Party Stand find its voice.\n\nEngland's decision to field first was based on necessity. With the bad weather due at the weekend, the home side needed to give themselves as much time as possible to take 20 Australian wickets.\n\nWhen the coin landed in Ben Stokes' favour for the fourth consecutive match in this series, the overheads suggested a favourable time to bowl, but by the time play began the sun was shining and did so for the remainder of the day.\n\nTherefore, on a flat pitch, it could be that Australia did not make the most of the best batting day of the match - certainly the amount of batters who got out after making starts points to a collective lack of ruthlessness.\n\nBy the end, little had been determined, neither side able to say with certainty they had grabbed the upper hand.\n\nThis was an impressive performance by England with the ball and in the field. To be hyper-critical, they occasionally bowled a touch too wide but, on the whole carried a regular threat and, importantly, held all of their chances.\n\nBroad was wayward with the new ball but still removed Usman Khawaja, then bowled a beautiful spell after tea that included bouncing out Head for the milestone 600th wicket.\n\nMark Wood had the pace to draw a mistake from Smith, Moeen Ali found turn and pinned Labuschagne leg before, while James Anderson was economical bowling from the end that carries his name.\n\nThe pick, though, was Woakes, recalled to play a vital role in the win at Headingley and rewarded for maintaining a full length here.\n\nHe drew David Warner into an edge in the morning session, then bowled a crucial spell in the evening that included removing Cameron Green and Marsh in the same over.\n\nBairstow, under-pressure for his glovework, had been untidy throughout the day, but the swoop to his right to grasp the edge off Marsh was as spectacular as it was unexpected. Sitting on the floor with both fists clenched, he celebrated with gusto.\n\nIt looked like England would be defied by Carey and Starc, yet the dependable Woakes was trusted with the second new ball, taking an edge as Carey looked to leave.\n\nEven if captain Pat Cummins said he would have bowled first, Australia knew they were one strong batting performance away from effectively retaining the urn.\n\nThe tourists had even lengthened their line-up by including all-rounder Green at the expense of spinner Todd Murphy, but could still not take full advantage of the flat pitch and warm sun.\n\nOnly Khawaja, trapped on the crease by Broad, failed to get in. There were partnerships of 46, 59, 63 and 65 for the second, third, fourth and sixth wickets respectively, only for the majority of the top order to find sloppy ways of getting out.\n\nWarner at least avoided falling to Broad, but played a loose drive at Woakes. Smith looked ominous until he played across the line against Wood. Labuschagne made his first half-century of the series, then missed an innocuous delivery from Moeen.\n\nHead was suckered into England's short-ball plan and, as Marsh and Green looked to to be swinging the day Australia's way, both fell in the space of five Woakes deliveries.\n\nCarey and Starc dropped anchor, their stand of 39 coming at little more than two runs an over, before Carey's misjudgement against Woakes.\n\nThat left Starc unbeaten on 23, joined by skipper Cummins on one.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special: \"I'm intrigued by this pitch, I don't think you can play aggressively constantly. England will come out and bat quickly. Australia have lost an opportunity here.\"\n\nEngland bowler Stuart Broad: \"My mum has been an amazing support for me and her mindset has always been playing for fun and it always felt like a hobby to me.\n\n\"I've reconnected massively with that - Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes that's been their philosophy and I've loved every moment of it.\"", "Protests over the sentencing have taken place in Leipzig and other cities\n\nLeft-wing protesters and police have clashed for a second night over a jail term given to a woman convicted of vigilante attacks on neo-Nazis.\n\nDemonstrators in the eastern city of Leipzig set up road blocks, lit fires and threw stones at officers, police said.\n\nLina E was sentenced to five years in jail, but released pending an appeal as she had been detained since 2020.\n\nThe protest in the city, where Lina E had studied, had earlier been banned.\n\nA police spokesman said around 1,500 people turned up anyway, claiming around a third of those were \"prone to violence\", the Reuters news agency reports.\n\nSaturday's violence followed similar scenes the previous night, when several hundred people lit bonfires in the street and thrown stones from buildings onto police vehicles.\n\nOn Sunday police said about 50 officers had been hurt and 30 protesters arrested over the two nights.\n\nLina E was regarded as a leader of a far-left group responsible for carrying out a brutal campaign of violence against the extreme right over several years, including attacks with hammers, iron bars and baseball bats.\n\nAfter Lina E was found guilty, there were far-left protests in several cities and police were targeted with bottles and fireworks and baseball bats.\n\nThree men convicted alongside her were also given jail sentences on Wednesday.\n\nOther Germans were angered by the decision to release Lina E, after two-and-a-half years in custody -

including obstructing shop doorways or begging at cash machines.\n\nCouncil workers and law enforcement officers will also be given the \"tools\" to direct people who are deemed to be causing a \"nuisance on the street\" to health and social services.\n\nFurther detail on where the pilots will take place and how much it will cost is expected to be set out in the coming days.\n\nIt will be rolled out across England and Wales in 2024.\n\nCommunities Secretary Michael Gove separately confirmed the government will ban the sale of nitrous oxide, telling the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg its recreational use is having an \"unacceptable\" effect on people's perception of safety in public spaces.\n\nHe added: \"We are doing this because if you walk through any urban park you will see these little silver cannister which are the evidence of people regarding public spaces as arenas for drug taking.\"\n\nThe plans to crack down on anti-social behaviour comes after a highly critical report into the Metropolitan Police by Baroness Casey, which cited austerity as a factor behind the erosion of the London force's frontline policing.\n\nThe report, published earlier this week, said London no longer has a functioning neighbourhood policing service as teams have been \"decimated\" and the force has become \"less connected and less accountable\".\n\nAhead of the plan being published, Mr Sunak said: \"For too long, people have put up with the scourge of anti-social behaviour in their neighbourhoods.\n\n\"These are not minor crimes. They disrupt people's daily lives, hold businesses back and erode the sense of safety and community that brings people together.\n\n\"That's why I'm bringing forward a new plan to crack down on this behaviour once and for all - so that everyone can feel proud of where they live.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe plan sets out how the government's \"community payback\" scheme - where offenders are sentenced by courts to do unpaid work, such as cleaning up public places - will be expanded.\n\nThe government has already said it will increase the number of hours of unpaid work offenders are given from five million to up to eight million a year.\n\nUnder a new pilot, delivered by the Probation Service working with some local authorities, teams of offenders will be rapidly deployed to clean up more urgent incidents of anti-social behaviour.\n\nIt said it will also extend offenders' involvement in campaigns such as Keep Britain Tidy's annual Great British Spring Clean.\n\nLast year 1,500 offenders spent almost 10,000 hours on 300 community clean-up projects across the campaign.\n\nThe government aims to double this in 2023.\n\nLast month, Labour said its plans to tackle anti-social behaviour included fly-tippers being forced to remove litter as part of \"clean-up squads\", and councils being able to make offenders remove graffiti or rubbish they had dumped.\n\nResponding to the government's latest plans, shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said: \"The Conservatives have let anti-social behaviour make people's lives a misery by slashing neighbourhood police and letting offenders get away without punishment.\n\n\"They have been content to oversee crumbling frontline services meaning these crimes are now plaguing communities, blighting town centres and leaving people feeling unsafe.\"\n\nMr Reed said the government was \"once again following where Labour has led by trying to copy our plan on tough community payback\", and that it was \"embarrassing\" that all the Conservatives could come up with was a pilot covering only 10 areas.\n\nThe remarks follow a speech earlier this week by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accusing the Tories of being \"soft\" on anti-social behaviour - \"the crime that most affects working class communities\".", "Google has removed a highly controversial game called Slavery Simulator from its app store, after it caused outrage in Brazil.\n\nThe app, which allowed players to \"buy and sell\" black characters, was launched by Magnus Games on 20 April.\n\nThe game was downloaded more than 1,000 times before it was removed on Wednesday, local media reported.\n\nBrazil is a country still coming to terms with its legacy of slavery, which was only abolished in 1888.\n\nIn a description of the game, the developer boasted that users could \"exchange, buy and sell slaves\". It also allowed players to inflict various forms of torture on black characters.\n\nAccording to images of the game, users were offered a choice to either liberate the enslaved characters or \"use slaves for your own enrichment. Prevent the abolition of slavery and accumulate wealth\".\n\nAt the time of its removal, the game had a rating of four out of five stars, with one review reading: \"Great game to pass the time. But I think it lacked more torture options.\"\n\nSocial media users in Brazil expressed fury over the game, and a number of prominent politicians urged officials to hold tech companies to a higher standard.\n\n\"The image illustrating the game has a white man surrounded by black men. It is absurdly violent.

It added that the developers would be held legally responsible.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, a Google spokesperson said that the Play Store does not allow \"apps that promote violence or incite hatred against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, or that depict or promote gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities\".\n\n\"When violations are found, we take appropriate action,\" it added.\n\nMagnus Games did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but in its description of the game the company said it was \"created solely for entertainment purposes.

The announcements in the \u201cAtlantic Declaration\u201d indicate a closer relationship on technology, defence and green industries. The UK car industry wanted a \u201ccritical minerals agreement\u201d to be signed with the US - opening up British car exports to be treated in the US like domestic-produced vehicles in terms of significant green subsidies. The declaration confirms that negotiations will now begin - though Japan signed an equivalent deal with the US three months ago, and the equivalent US-EU deal has already been drafted. The US and UK will now co-operate on critical supply chains, and economic resilience in the face of shocks. But what the friendly language of the declaration omits, though, is that the UK is not planning to follow the US on its path of massive tax subsidies for green investment. The White House believes this is creating hundreds of thousands of highly-paid manufacturing jobs, in left behind areas, helping with net zero ambitions and reducing economic reliance on China. Sunak is trying to keep in tune with this revolution in US economic policy without following it. The same Bidenomics policies also mean that what was thought of as one of the great prizes of Brexit - the ability to do a proper free trade deal with the US - is not on the US agenda.", "Harold, his wife Sybil, and clinical specialist Sam Miggins who he calls \"a life saver\"\n\nA motorcyclist paralysed in a crash and told he would never walk again has taken his first steps with robotic legs originally developed for US soldiers.\n\nBut Harold Price, 79, is paying \u00a3800 a month to be treated privately after being denied help on the NHS.\n\nHis story is \"very common\" because physiotherapy services have been \"left behind\", a rehabilitation expert has said.\n\nA health board said patients were free to choose non-NHS therapies.\n\nIt was on 11 June 2021 that Harold's life changed forever when he broke his neck in a crash 12 miles (19km) from his home in Griffithstown, Torfaen.\n\nRecalling the fateful day, the retired fitter said: \"I was going to go cycling and my [motorcycling] mate rang me up.\n\n\"But for five minutes and this wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nAfter bumping into the back of his friend's bike at about 15mph (24km/h), Harold came off his 500cc Honda Rebel, and was rushed to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.\n\nDespite undergoing emergency spinal surgery, his hands and legs were left paralysed.\n\n\"They thought I wouldn't walk again,\" he said.\n\n\"I was really devastated. I thought 'I have got to get on my feet'.\"\n\nHarold taking his first steps since his accident with the help of wearable robotic legs, a treatment being trialled at a private clinic in Newport\n\nRehabilitation from a spinal injury often involves many hours of physiotherapy.\n\nBut Harold's clinical status - not able to walk again - disqualified him for physiotherapy on the NHS.\n\nSo he sat at home trying to teach himself to walk using a homemade device.\n\nIt led to a couple of falls and a lot of worry for Harold's wife.\n\nBefore starting physiotherapy at a private clinic, Harold tried to walk again with help from a friend, but had a couple of falls\n\n\"I turned my back and he was on the floor,\" remembered Sybil, 77.\n\n\"There didn't seem to be much hope.\n\n\"But having lived with Harold for 50-odd years, I knew he wasn't going to give up and he kept saying in the meetings, 'I'm going to walk'.\"\n\nSybil remembered being \"very frustrated\" because Harold was making progress even without physiotherapy, but his local GP was sticking with the original prognosis.\n\n\"They sent me a letter saying 'we can't do anything', they said 'he's not going to walk',\" she said.\n\n\"There was nowhere to go, so we had to decide then we're either going to listen to them and Hal will sit in a wheelchair, or we are going to pay ourselves.\"\n\nShe found a private clinic specialising in spinal injury rehabilitation in Langstone, Newport.\n\n\"When they said on the national health he couldn't have any more physio, I found this place,\" Sybil said from the Morrello Clinic where Harold does an hour-long session twice a week.\n\n\"We really haven't looked back since.\"\n\nHarold recently took his first steps since the accident using a walking frame with clinical specialist Sam Miggins crawling along the floor beside him \"placing\" his feet.\n\nRobotic legs allow Harold to walk with a cane as he gets private treatment with clinical specialist Sam Miggins\n\nThe progress has come after Harold's determination during sessions at the Morrello Clinic meant he was selected for a trial with wearable robotic legs.\n\nKeeogo was developed by Canadian company to increase the strength and endurance of US soldiers.\n\n\"The technology can help to pick up your feet,\" said Morrello's clinical director Jakko Brouwers, explaining how sensors in the robotic legs respond to the patient's movements.\n\nIt means Harold can walk from one end of the clinic to the other, getting the repetitions needed to learn to walk again.\n\n\"If you can only get fifty steps in a day that's fifty opportunities to learn,\" Mr Brouwers explained.\n\n\"With wearable robotics we can increase the amount of repetition.\"\n\nSessions with the robotic legs have also helped his mental health, making him think he has got \"a bit of a chance\" to walk again.\n\nHarold has been determined to walk again ever since his accident\n\nBut it comes at a financial cost.\n\nHarold pools his \u00a3350 monthly disability allowance from the Department for Work and Pensions with \u00a3450 of his own money to pay for eight hours of physiotherapy a month.\n\n\"We're not rich, but we can afford to prioritise the money that we've got for Harold,\" said Sybil.\n\nMr Brouwers said the NHS has to prioritise acute services over rehabilitation, adding: \"There isn't really the emphasis on buying technology to enhance the rehabilitation experience that people are getting.\"\n\nMr Brouwers said Harold could be further along in his rehabilitation if there had been access on the NHS\n\n\"People should not be paying so much for access to equipment,\" he added.\n\nMr Brouwers sees a \"common thread\" of people who deteriorate physically and mentally when they are sent home from hospital.\n\n\"It is very important to keep the positive mindset after catastrophic injury and the outlook is bleak,\" he said.\n\nHarold is shy about going out in public in a wheelchair, with wife Sybil saying he sometimes struggles to accept he has a disability\n\nProfessor Diane Playford, a consultant in neurology and in rehabilitation medicine at University of Warwick, said it is \"very common\" to find patients in Harold's situation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, although the acute services have been developed, the rehabilitation services haven't and they've been left behind,\" she said.\n\nBut better rehabilitation would ultimately mean less pressure on acute services, Prof Playford added.\n\nA spokesperson for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: \"Most patients who are admitted to our specialist spinal rehabilitation centre at University Hospital Llandough are in the first phase of their rehabilitation journey.\n\n\"All outcomes and prognosis are made following individualised specialist multi-disciplinary assessments and patient outcomes vary, depending on level and complexity of spinal injury.\n\n\"We do not place a time scale on progress or limits on rehabilitation.\n\n\"On discharge, rehabilitation continues within the community and local health boards and professionals undertake further assessments regarding the therapy input required to support ongoing rehabilitation.\n\n\"All patients have the right to decide what is the best action for them, and this may be through non-NHS services.\"\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the importance rehabilitation can have on a person's recovery which is why we are providing health boards with an additional \u00a31.4m per year for community-based multi professional rehabilitation support workers, as well as \u00a35m annually to fund more allied health professionals, which include physiotherapists, to provide rehabilitation services and support

She is reported to have asked civil servants about a one-on-one course, citing security concerns about doing one as part of a group. She was told it was not a matter for the civil service.\n\nShe then asked a special adviser to try to arrange a private course.\n\nWhen the speed course provider said there was no option to do this, Mrs Braverman opted to pay the fine and accept the points, because she was \"very busy\" a source told the BBC. By this point she had been reappointed as home secretary in Mr Sunak's government.\n\nThe same government source refused to say whether Mrs Braverman's motivation to do the course in private was to reduce the chances of her being recognised by members of the public.\n\nSpeeding awareness course providers are contracted by individual police forces. According to UK Road Offender Education, the not-for-profit organisation responsible, these contracts make \"no provision for private one-to-one courses\" at the request of the driver.\n\nThe ministerial code requires ministers to ensure \"no conflict arises\" between their public duties and their private interests.\n\nRepeatedly asked in an interview whether she instructed officials to arrange a one-on-one speeding course, Mrs Braverman said: \"Last summer, I was speeding, I regret that, I paid the fine and I took the points.\"\n\nAsked whether she would welcome an investigation into what happened or if she had spoken to the prime minister about it, Ms Braverman said: \"I am focussed on working as the home secretary.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Yvette Cooper claims Suella Braverman is \"not answering basic factual questions\" about her 2022 speeding fine\n\nSpeaking to the Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4, former senior civil servant Sir Philip Rycroft said Mrs Braverman's reported actions appeared to be a \"real lapse of judgement\".\n\n\"Obviously, there's still investigations to be done and so on but the code is very clear. Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises or appears to arise between their public duties and their private interests.\n\n\"Even asking a question of a civil servant as to how she might go on one of these courses puts them in an impossible position.\"\n\nThe ministerial code sets standards of conduct expected of ministers, including that they must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service.\n\nFormer business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4's World at One, he was confident Ms Braverman had not broken any rules.\n\n\"What goes on in private offices is a minister is busy and has many things to do and sometimes will ask for something the civil servants can't do,\" he said.\n\n\"As soon as once they say no, and you accept it, you haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Sunak told MPs he has \"asked for further information\" and will update MPs \"on the appropriate course of action in due course\".\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak \"wants to avail himself of all the information before he makes a decision\". The prime minister still has confidence in the home secretary, the spokesman added.\n\nMrs Braverman was in Downing Street on Monday lunchtime, and afterwards headed to the House of Commons for a scheduled question session from MPs on Home Office issues.\n\nDuring the session, Mrs Braverman was repeatedly pressed on whether she had asked civil servants to arrange a private speed awareness course.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"If the home secretary can't grip on her own rule-breaking behaviour how can she get a grip on anything else.\"\n\nThe home secretary told MPs she had paid the speeding fine and had not sought to avoid any sanction.\n\nLabour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should order his adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate whether ministerial rules were broken.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said it looked like \"inappropriate action took place\" from the home secretary that \"needs to be fully investigated\".\n\n\"The usual consequence of breaking the ministerial code is that you'll go,\" he added.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are also calling for an investigation and said Mr Sunak needed to make a statement in Parliament about the claims.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. \"Did you have any questions about the summit?\" Rishi Sunak asks the BBC's Chris Mason\n\nAnswering questions at the G7 summit over the weekend, Mr Sunak apparently did not know anything about the story the until it was first reported in the Sunday Times. and he declined to say whether he would be ordering an investigation.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, he also declined to say he backed Mrs Braverman - but a Downing Street source later said that \"of course\" he did.\n\nAfter serving as attorney general between February 2020 and September 2022, Mrs Braverman was promoted to home secretary under Liz Truss.\n\nShe resigned on 19 October after sending an official document from a personal email to a backbench MP - describing it as a \"technical infringement of the rules\". But she was reappointed to the same role by Mr Sunak six days later following the collapse of Liz Truss's government.", "Ukraine has been planning its counter-offensive for months - and it now may finally be under way\n\nWas this the week that Ukraine's long-anticipated counter-offensive finally got under way?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. \"We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun,\" he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday.\n\nIn some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as \"shaping operations\": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines.\n\nMonday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\"Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front,\" Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC.\n\n\"That means there's a probing of Russian defences.\"\n\nSome videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble.\n\n\"Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses,\" Mr Kuzan said. \"And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back.\"\n\nMr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nBy Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River.\n\nFor all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance.\n\nIt seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table.\n\nKyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once.\n\nIn late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson.\n\nThe extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being.\n\n\"But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians,\" Mr Kuzan said.\n\nThe burst dam has caused catastrophic flooding across southern Ukraine\n\nWhile the authorities in Kyiv suddenly grappled with the flooding, the fighting continued - and seemed to escalate - further east.\n\nBy early Thursday morning, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted that \"heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front,\" adding that in most areas \"Ukraine holds the initiative.\"\n\nIn a video the same day, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russian forces had repelled an overnight Ukrainian attack in the area south of Zaporizhzhia, involving 150 armoured vehicles and 1,500 troops.\n\nAccording to the Russian Defence Ministry, Ukraine's 47th Mechanised Brigade \"made an attempt to break through Russian lines.\"\n\nA video circulated on the internet, purporting to show something new: a western-supplied Leopard tank being destroyed. The BBC has not yet verified the video.\n\nUkrainian officials, characteristically tight lipped about current operations, offered tantalising glimpses into what was going on.\n\nHanna Malyar, the Deputy Defence Minister, coyly said that Russian troops were \"actively on the defensive\" in the area around the town of Orikhiv, around 65km south-east of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nIn a statement on Telegram, she also confirmed that battles were continuing around Velyka Novosilka, further east.\n\nThe two towns likely form the western and eastern edges of a heavily fortified stretch of the front line where many analysts believe Ukraine will eventually try and punch through Russian lines.\n\n\"It's not a secret that one of our main goals is to cut the land corridor that feeds the whole southern grouping of enemy forces,\" Mr Kuzan said.\n\nUkrainian forces want to cut the Russian-held land corridor to Crimea\n\nPro-Russian Telegram channels in the Donbas were full of excited chatter about Ukraine's latest moves, much of it laced with scorn.\n\n\"They are going where the Russians are waiting for them,\" one member posted in the I Love Kramatorsk group. \"What stupidity!\"\n\nOthers acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had moved forward, but questioned the price in lost men and armour.\n\n\"I really question the price of this success,\" another member of the same group commented.\n\n\"Do they have enough forces to reach Tokmak [44km south of Orikhiv], let alone Berdyansk and Melitopol?\"\n\nBut it's not the only area where fighting is raging.\n\nFootage from north and south of the city of Bakhmut, scene of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the war, appeared to show Ukrainian forces moving forward.\n\nMs Malyar said they had advanced \"from 200 to 1,100 metres in various sections,\" in what may eventually be an effort to encircle the city and trap its Russian occupiers.\n\nIt is, as the UK's Ministry of Defence noted, \"a highly complex operational picture\".\n\nBut does it mean that Ukraine's counter-offensive is already entering a dramatic new phase?\n\nOn Wednesday, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, scoffed at the idea.\n\n\"All of this is not true,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"When we start the counter-offensive, everyone will know about it. They will see it.\"\n\nThe air war - including the use of drones - will be vital for Ukraine's counteroffensive\n\nBut something has definitely changed.\n\n\"The point is that the front is finally moving,\" Serhii Kuzan said, adding that several options were still open to Ukrainian commanders.\n\nBut Ukraine is also operating under a number of significant restraints, the main one being the lack of fighter jets capable of providing support from the air.\n\n\"That's why we move slowly,\" Mr Kuzan said, \"and then move air defence [systems] closer.\"\n\nAnother factor is time. This offensive will probably last no more than five months, after which autumn rain will once again render open ground impassable for heavy armoured vehicles.\n\nWhat will success look like?\n\nIf Ukrainian forces can punch through Russian lines, all the way to the Sea of Azov, then any Russian troops west of that breach will suddenly be much more vulnerable, dependent entirely on supply lines through the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nAll that would then remain, Mr Kuzan says, would be to destroy the Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea (briefly disabled by a huge truck bomb last October) and attack ships and planes being used to ferry supplies to the peninsula.\n\n\"That would be the end,\" he says. \"But don't expect this to happen soon.

Princess Anne on King Charles: \u2018You know what you're getting\u2019\n\nThe Princess Royal has said she does not think her brother, King Charles, will be changed by his new role.\n\nSpeaking to CBC News, the BBC's partner in Canada, Princess Anne said the King was \"committed\" to public service and that would \"remain true\".\n\nShe added that her brother's reign would bring a \"shift\" in how the rest of the family supported the monarch.\n\nKing Charles, who acceded to the throne on the death of his mother last year, is set to be crowned on Saturday.\n\nAs part of preparations for the event, the King and Queen Consort will attend a reception at the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday to meet members of both Houses of Parliament as well as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nThe King spent more than 70 years as heir apparent, longer than anyone else in British history, and in his mother's later years frequently represented her on official engagements.\n\nIn an interview at St James's Palace, Princess Anne said: \"You know what you're getting because he's been practicing for a bit, and I don't think he'll change.\n\n\"You know, he is committed to his own level of service, and that will remain true.\"\n\nDiscussing the future role of the rest of the family, the princess said the monarch was the \"key\" figure and that \"we... see ourselves as there to support that role\".\n\n\"What we do, we hope, contributes to the monarchy in the way it can convey continuity... of service, of understanding,\" she said.\n\nReports have previously suggested the King plans to reduce the number of working royals and the size of his staff in order to reduce the cost of the institution.\n\nAsked about the idea of a \"slimmed down\" monarchy, the princess said it was originally proposed \"when there were a few more people around\".\n\n\"It doesn't sound like a good idea from where I'm standing, I would say. I'm not quite sure what else we can do,\" she said.\n\nThe death of the Queen has led to renewed debate in a number of the Commonwealth realms about whether to keep the King as their head of state.\n\nA poll in September suggested that 54% of people in Canada thought the country should now end its ties with the British monarchy, while 46% disagreed.\n\nThe princess acknowledged that conversations about the relevance of the monarchy would be taking place, but added it was \"not a conversation that I would necessarily have\".\n\n\"I think it's perfectly true that it is a moment when you need to have that discussion,\" she said.\n\n\"But I would just underline that the monarchy provides - with the constitution - a degree of long-term stability that is actually quite hard to come by any other way.\"\n\nWhat are your plans for the coronation?

Humza Yousaf told his party now it is time for the SNP to come together and deliver independence\n\nHumza Yousaf is to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister after a vote of party members.\n\nMr Yousaf defeated rivals Kate Forbes and Ash Regan in a leadership contest that exposed deep divisions within the party.\n\nThe 37-year-old is the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.\n\nHe is set to be confirmed as the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government on Tuesday.\n\nMr Yousaf is currently Scotland's health secretary and was widely assumed to be Ms Sturgeon's preferred successor, although she did not explicitly back any of the candidates in the contest.\n\nThe leadership election was decided by the Single Transferable Vote system, with 50,490 of the SNP's 72,169 members casting a ballot - the vast majority of them online.\n\nMr Yousaf failed to win a majority in the first round of voting, but won 52.1% of the votes after second preference votes from Ms Regan, who was eliminated after finishing third, were redistributed.\n\nMs Forbes came second with 47.9% of the votes when second preferences were included, with Mr Yousaf receiving 26,032 votes and Ms Forbes 23,890.\n\nThe new SNP leader will face a vote in the Scottish Parliament - which he is certain to win - on Tuesday before becoming Scotland's sixth first minister.\n\nHe had been the clear favourite with the bookmakers during the contest, although polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said ahead of the result that Ms Forbes appeared to be more popular with Scottish voters as a whole.\n\nMs Forbes, a member of the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, had been attacked by the SNP hierarchy during the contest over her socially conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and having children outside of marriage.\n\nSpeaking after being confirmed as the new leader at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, Mr Yousaf said it would be \"the greatest honour and privilege of my life\" to be the next first minister.\n\nAnd he called on the party to unite behind him after what has often been a fractious leadership contest.\n\nHe said independence would be won \"on the doorsteps\" and pledged to kickstart a grassroots campaign, adding: \"We will be the generation to win independence for Scotland\".\n\nMr Yousaf added: \"In the SNP we are a family. Over the last five weeks we may have been competitors or supporters of different candidates.\n\n\"We are no longer team Humza, or team Ash, or team Kate, we are one team.\"\n\nMr Yousaf also said his grandparents had arrived in Scotland from Pakistan in the 1960s barely able to speak a word of English, and would not have believed \"in their wildest dreams\" that their grandson would one day become first minister of Scotland.\n\nMs Sturgeon, who was Scotland's longest-serving first minister, announced last month she was stepping down after more than eight years in the job.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Humza Yousaf defeated rivals Kate Forbes and Ash Regan in the leadership contest\n\nShe said Mr Yousaf will be an \"outstanding\" leader as she congratulated him on his appointment, adding: \"I could not be prouder to have him succeed me\".\n\nIt was the first time the SNP has had a leadership contest since 2004, with Ms Sturgeon being unopposed when she replaced Alex Salmond in 2014.\n\nMr Yousaf becomes only its fifth leader since 1979, and will face the task of uniting a party that has dominated Scottish politics in recent years but which has looked deeply divided in the wake of Ms Sturgeon's resignation.\n\nMs Sturgeon's surprise announcement that she was resigning came just three weeks after she insisted that she had \"plenty in the tank\" and still believed she would lead Scotland to independence.\n\nHer husband, Peter Murrell, was forced to resign midway through the campaign after it emerged the party's membership stood at 72,000 rather than the 104,000 it had consistently claimed to have.\n\nThe party still faces a police probe over the use of \u00a3600,000 which was raised by activists who were told it would be ringfenced for a second independence referendum, and questions over why Mr Murrell gave a SNP a loan of more than \u00a3100,000 in June 2021.\n\nThe SNP and Mr Murrell both deny they have done anything wrong, with Ms Sturgeon saying she \"can't recall\" when she first learned of her husband's six-figure loan.\n\nMr Yousaf was seen as the \"continuity candidate\" throughout the campaign - a strong position given Nicola Sturgeon's enduring popularity with SNP members.\n\nHe had by far the most endorsements from MSPs and MPs, including most of Ms Sturgeon's inner circle.\n\nThat means he should have a relatively easy time putting together a cabinet and bringing the party back together in parliament.\n\nHe was also the candidate best-placed to bring the Greens back into government, although they are meeting this afternoon to decide their next steps.\n\nBut it is inescapable that Mr Yousaf's margin of victory was razor-thin. A big, big chunk of the SNP voted for candidates promising change.\n\nSo the question now will be the extent to which the \"continuity candidate\" seeks to differentiate himself from his predecessor's agenda. Will he forge on with all of her policies, or seek to carve out more of an identity for himself?\n\nAnd given he only just won over half of his own party, will he be able to replicate Ms Sturgeon's popularity with the broader electorate when the next election rolls around?\n\nMr Yousaf had pitched himself to some extent as the \"continuity candidate\" during the leadership campaign, and was forced to deny claims that the SNP establishment was doing everything it could to ensure he won.\n\nHe has often spoken of his admiration for Ms Sturgeon, but insists that he is \"his own man and will do things my own way\".\n\nHe was on the receiving end of a withering attack from Ms Forbes in a live STV debate, when she told him: \"You were transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we've got record high waiting times\".\n\nBut Ms Forbes congratulated him on his success, saying: \"Whatever the robust disagreements or frank exchanges of the last few weeks, I am confident we will unite behind Humza as our new party leader in the shared and common objective of independence.\"\n\nMs Regan, who had always been regarded as the outsider in the contest, tweeted her congratulations to Mr Yousaf after what she described as a \"lively contest\" and urged everyone to \"get behind Team SNP\".\n\nHis supporters say Mr Yousaf is a polished communicator who is best placed to unite the party and maintain the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens - which had been widely expected to collapse if either Ms Forbes or Ms Regan had won.\n\nMr Yousaf was congratulated by his wife Nadia El-Nakla, as well as his daughter and step-daughter\n\nThe Scottish Greens said its council had voted unanimously to continue to support the agreement with the SNP and for its MSPs to back Mr Yousaf in the vote to become the next first minister.\n\nGreens co-leader Patrick Harvie said: \"This overwhelming endorsement of our arrangement will allow us to continue with the progressive, collaborative politics we know can help deliver a fairer, greener and more equal Scotland for all.\"\n\nMr Yousaf was first elected in 2011 as a regional MSP for Glasgow and was appointed a junior minister the following year, before becoming justice secretary in 2018 and health secretary three years later.\n\nHe will immediately face having to make a host of tough decisions, including whether to fight the UK government's block on Scotland's gender reforms in the courts - Mr Yousaf says he wants to but only if the legal advice is that it stands a chance of success - and what to do with other controversial polices inherited from Ms Sturgeon such as the deposit return scheme and new national care service.\n\nThe country's health service has seen record waiting times under Mr Yousaf's watch - although he points out that the issue is not unique to Scotland - and he will now also be ultimately responsible for an education system that has so far shown little sign of achieving Ms Sturgeon's mission of closing the wide attainment gap between the wealthiest and most deprived pupils.\n\nAfter being voted leader of the Scottish National Party, we ask - who is Humza Yousaf?\n\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer (UK only).\n\nDowning Street said the prime minister was looking forward to working with Mr Yousaf, but stressed it will be focused on the \"issues that matter to people\" such as reducing inflation and dealing with the cost of living crisis rather than independence.\n\nDouglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said he had \"serious concerns\" about Mr Yousaf's ability, adding: \"We hope he does not lurch from failure to failure as he did when he was Nicola Sturgeon's health secretary, justice secretary and transport minister\".\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar - who was at school with Mr Yousaf at the private Hutchesons' Grammar in Glasgow - said the election of a first minister from an ethnic minority background would be a \"significant moment for Scotland\".\n\nBut he said Mr Yousaf was inheriting \"the SNP's woeful record, but he has not inherited Nicola Sturgeon's mandate\", and called for a Holyrood election to be held.\n\nMr Ross and Mr Sarwar will both stand against Mr Yousaf in the first minister vote in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, as will Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton - although none of the opposition leaders has any prospect of winning.", "All of EG's sites are to be rebranded under the Asda name\n\nThe Asda chairman has warned of \"unintended consequences\" if the government asks supermarkets to impose price caps on basic food.\n\nStuart Rose told the BBC any such move could be \"counterproductive\", and that shoppers face the possibility of missing out on better deals.\n\nHis comments came as Asda agreed to buy the UK and Ireland business of petrol station giant EG Group for \u00a32.27bn.\n\nThe deal will see Asda step up its growth in the convenience food sector.\n\nAt the weekend it emerged that the government is in talks about asking supermarkets to cap prices on basic food items to help tackle the rising cost of living.\n\nMr Rose told the BBC that UK food retailers were \"already competing very heavily with each other to give our customers the best possible deal\" and were \"well ahead of what the government can offer\"'\n\n\"Starting to try and manipulate markets or control markets is is not going to be effective,\" he said. \"Be careful about what you wish for, be careful about the unintended consequences.\"\n\nHe said any action by the government to fix prices \"actually would be counterproductive because if you say you're going to fix the price and suppose then you could actually do it cheaper and you'd agree to keep it at a higher price, you'd be depriving the customer of a better deal\".\n\n\"So that's the anti-competitive and actually it's almost a cartel, and cartels are illegal.\"\n\nIndustry body the British Retail Consortium has already said the possible measures would not make a \"jot of difference to prices\".\n\nAsda's deal to buy the UK and Irish assets of EG Group brings together two businesses that are already owned by the billionaire Issa brothers.\n\nThe newly-combined company will have revenues of nearly \u00a330bn and employ about 166,000 people.\n\nMr Rose said the deal was needed as all Asda's competitors ran convenience stores. \"We are now going to be in the convenience business, so we'll be a complete retailer.\"\n\nEG has about 350 petrol stations and more than 1,000 food-to-go locations. All of its sites will be rebranded under the Asda name.\n\nAsda - which is the UK's third largest supermarket - currently has 438 petrol stations, including 129 forecourts that it bought from the Co-op last year in a \u00a3600m deal.\n\nThere are already 166 Asda \"On the Move\" convenience stores, which have been rolled out on EG sites since the Issa brothers bought the supermarket in 2021.\n\nAsda co-owner Mohsin Issa said the combination would be \"positive news for motorists, as we will be able to bring Asda's highly competitive fuel offer to even more customers\".\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently investigating all supermarkets over high food and fuel prices.\n\nThe watchdog is looking at whether a \"failure in competition\" means customers are overpaying, despite claims by supermarkets that they are working to keep food prices \"as low as possible\".\n\nA separate investigation into the fuel market has found some supermarkets have increased margins on petrol and diesel.\n\nAsda said it planned to invest more than \u00a3150m over the next three years to integrate the two businesses.\n\nIt hopes to make savings of about \u00a3100m in the next three years, by taking advantage of the size of the new group and higher sales volumes.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the idea behind the tie-up was that \"by being super-competitive on petrol, Asda may win more grocery custom from rivals at a time when grocery top-ups are all the rage, rather than dedicated weekly shops\".\n\n\"But while the cost-of-living crisis rages... the search for value may be prioritised over convenience for the foreseeable future,\" she added.\n\n\"It was inevitable the Issa brothers would want to consolidate assets they already own,\" Mr Hyman said. \"The only reason they'll be doing this is to cut costs.\"\n\nZuber Issa, co-founder and co-chief executive of EG Group, said the deal was \"an important strategic step for EG Group\".\n\n\"Following this sale, EG Group will benefit from a significantly strengthened balance sheet,\" he said in a statement.\n\nEG said proceeds from the sale of its UK and Ireland business to Asda, together with $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) raised from a US deal, would be used to pay down debts.\n\nThe GMB union said it was concerned that rising interest rates would saddle Asda with \"unsustainable\" levels of debt.\n\nIn a letter to Mr Rose, GMB national officer Nadine Houghton said: \"There is a huge question over who will pay the price for this debt leveraging. Will it be the 7,000 low paid retail staff in Asda's Southeast stores who are going to have their pay slashed by fire and re-hire?\n\n\"Or is this just the beginning of a wholesale assault on the pay of working people across Asda?\"", "TransPennine Express will be nationalised after customer complaints of poor service and cancelled trains.\n\nThe government will now run the service which covers Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds in the north of England and runs to Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nPassengers will see no change to the service but the overall aim is to improve its performance.\n\nIn January and February about a quarter of its services were cancelled, which was the highest rate in the UK.\n\nThat improved to around one in six in March, but it was still the worst-performing train operator in terms of cancellations.\n\nThe Department for Transport said that TransPennine's contract would not be renewed on 28 May.\n\nIt will now be run by the Operator of Last Resort (OLR), which means a business will step in on behalf of the government to take over the management of the service.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said taking TransPennine under state control was \"not a silver bullet and will not instantaneously fix a number of challenges being faced\".\n\nTransPennine, which is run by the company FirstGroup, has stood out for the number of trains it has cancelled the night before they are due to run, which it has blamed on staff shortages.\n\nThe rail operator's services run across the north of England, and include destinations in Yorkshire, the North East and Lincolnshire.\n\nPassengers on the packed Manchester to York line on Thursday morning weren't surprised by the news.\n\n\"I've been getting this train for 20 years and it's been a bit fraught,\" said Chris Flanagan.\n\nA few years ago there was some investment, but since the Covid pandemic \"it's been absolutely horrendous\", he said.\n\n\"Most days you can't actually get into the office. [It's been] pretty grim,\" he added.\n\nFellow commuter Sarah Hunt agreed, saying she checks what trains are running both the night before and in the morning before setting off.\n\nBut the the service being nationalised \"could be a good thing\", she said.\n\n\"I feel like Northern did benefit a lot from when it was taken over by the Operator of Last Resort, so I do think that possibly, it could be quite useful.\"\n\nNorthern, London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and Southeastern Trains are all currently run by the OLR.\n\nScotrail, Transport for Wales and Northern Ireland Railways are also nationalised.\n\nBased on the latest figures, when the OLR takes over TransPennine's contract, more than one in five train journeys in Britain could be run by nationalised companies.\n\nNigel Harris, managing editor of Rail magazine, said nationalising TransPennine was little more than \"political window dressing\", as in effect the government has been in control of the rail network in England since coronavirus lockdowns led to \"the collapse of all the franchises\".\n\nEmergency contracts were signed during the pandemic, which were replaced by national rail contracts with most train companies in England, whereby the company is paid a fixed fee to operate services and the taxpayer shoulders the financial risk.\n\n\"There will be no immediate difference in how the services are operated and the same old problems will persist - but now it will be clearly the government's fault,\" Mr Harris said.\n\nThere has been ongoing disruption to TransPennine services since early 2022, but the company has said a recovery plan was bringing the numbers down.\n\nIt has previously blamed high staff sickness rates, a backlog of driver training and the lack of an overtime working agreement with the drivers' union Aslef.\n\nThe transport secretary also blamed strikes by Aslef for hampering a full service being offered on TransPennine routes.\n\nHowever, Aslef said that was \"misleading\" and that the blame should lie with the company's \"inept management\".\n\nFirstGroup said it was disappointed by the government's decision not to renew the contract it has run in various guises since 2004.\n\n\"Our team have worked extremely hard to improve services, including by recruiting and training more drivers than ever before,\" said Graham Sutherland, FirstGroup's chief executive.\n\nHowever, Louise Haigh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: \"This endless cycle of shambolic private operators failing passengers shows the Conservatives' rail system is fundamentally broken.\"\n\nA Labour government would nationalise railways as contracts expire, she added.\n\nAndy Burnham, Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, said privatisation has \"seen fares shoot up, and the standard of services go down, and the companies in the end are not accountable to the paying public\".\n\nWest Yorkshire's Labour Mayor Tracy Brabin said there had been \"a catalogue of failure and delays and cancellations\" on TransPennine and that it was \"absolutely right that this is the end of the line\" for the operator.", "David Yates was wanted in connection with the death of his partner Marelle Sturrock\n\nPolice investigating the murder of a pregnant teacher in Glasgow have found the body of a man in a reservoir.\n\nIt has still to be formally identified, but officers believe it is David Yates, 36, the partner of Marelle Sturrock.\n\nMs Sturrock, 35, was found dead at her home on Tuesday.

All of our focus remains on a quick return to the Premier League.\"\n\nAfter relegation was confirmed, the Leeds United Supporters Club released a statement saying Radrizzani was \"no longer an appropriate person to own Leeds United\".\n\n\"His behaviour is appalling and he risks never being welcome at our club again,\" it added.\"The sooner he goes the better and we look forward to the 49ers Enterprises offer being accepted. The only way he can begin to salvage his reputation is through an immediate sale of the club and the stadium.\"\n\nRadrizzani was popular with Leeds fans initially, with manager Marcelo Bielsa taking them back into the Premier League. But the relationship soured after he sacked the Argentine, and he did not attend their final game, a defeat by Tottenham which sealed their relegation while fans chanted for him to leave.\n\nThis deal has to be good for the club - analysis\n\nThis news has been expected since Sampdoria confirmed Radrizzani had taken a stake in the club, which had just been relegated to Serie B.\n\nThe brutal truth is that Radrizzani, charismatic as he is, lacks the funds to really shove Leeds up the Premier League in the way the 49ers have.\n\nIt was hoped they could escape again this term but, ultimately, they just were not good enough and not even interim boss Sam Allardyce could save them.\n\nHowever, while no-one would choose to get relegated because of the uncertainty it brings, under the circumstances it does not need to be a disaster.\n\nAllardyce has gone, just as director of football Victor Orta went before him. Recruitment-wise, Leeds are starting with a clean slate.\n\nWhat they are not starting with in the Championship is a level playing field.

Many refugees have since been living in hotels across the UK.\n\nMr Mercer said the thousands of people who left Afghanistan were housed in \"bridging hotels\" which were never meant to be permanent.\n\nHe added that of the 24,500 people now living in the UK under the two resettlement schemes, about 8,000 remained in hotels, with about half of those being children - costing \u00a31m a day.\n\nThe government says that Afghans make up a fifth of all people living in bridging hotels.\n\nMr Mercer said the long-term residency in hotels has \"prevented some Afghans\" from putting down roots, committing to employment and integrating into communities, as well as creating uncertainty.\n\nBut campaigners said the new policy would cause anxiety and upheaval for refugees who had already experienced trauma, and could leave Afghans at risk of becoming homeless.\n\nAfter its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the UK pledged to resettle up to 20,000 more vulnerable Afghans under the ACRS.\n\nThe government will begin writing to families and individuals housed in hotels at the end of April, giving them \"at least three months' notice\" before they are forced out, Mr Mercer told the Commons.\n\nHe promised \"generous\" support, with trained staff based at hotels to provide advice - including Home Office staff and charity workers.\n\nThe veterans minister said \u00a335m of funding would help councils provide increased support and the local authority housing fund would be expanded by \u00a3250m.\n\nThe increased fund for local authorities will help councils to source homes for Afghan refugees currently in hotels, the government says.\n\nMr Mercer noted there was a \"national duty\" owed to Afghan refugees who helped British forces during the war.\n\nHe added that \"in return, we do expect families to help themselves\" and where an offer of accommodation was turned down, \"another will now not be forthcoming\".\n\nHe said: \"At a time when there are many pressures on the taxpayer and the housing market, it is not right that people can choose to stay in hotels when other perfectly suitable accommodation is available.\"\n\nVeterans Minister Johnny Mercer announced the plan in the Commons\n\nEnver Solomon from the Refugee Council said the government's plan risked people being left \"homeless and destitute on the streets of Britain\".\n\nHe said: \"This is not how those who were promised a warm welcome in the UK should be treated.\"\n\nGovernment plans to resettle Afghans who had worked with the UK during the war were initially named Operation Warm Welcome.\n\nMr Solomon added: \"To expect councils to suddenly move them out of hotels by putting pressure on Afghan families risks causing great misery and anxiety for those who have already experienced trauma and upheaval.\"\n\nLabour called on the government to ensure no Afghans would be left homeless.\n\nShadow defence secretary John Healey accused the government of \"serving eviction notices on 8,000 Afghans - half of whom are children - with no guarantee they will be offered a suitable, settled place to live\".\n\nHe said: \"Never mind 'Operation Warm Welcome', never mind the warm words from the minister today.

Milan face Inter on Wednesday.\n\nNot that Guardiola will let his players get carried away with that scenario.\n\nThey lead the Premier League from Arsenal with four games to go and face Manchester United, the only English team to win the Treble, in the FA Cup final in June.\n\nTalk before the game was of revenge, with Real beating City at this stage last season in a 6-5 aggregate classic.\n\nBut, a year on, City look more grown up and almost unbeatable. This game was edgy and heated but lacked some of the chaos of last season's first leg, which ended 4-3.\n\nGuardiola knows his best team now so the days of throwing a tactical shock, which often did not work, in a game like this seem a thing of the past.\n\nThey played this game as if they were at home, with Real supporters booing their relentless possession. Courtois had four saves to make in the opening 16 minutes alone.\n\nBut then they trailed to Vinicius' goal - with the Brazilian also scoring against City last year.\n\nHowever their heads did not drop, and their three-month unbeaten run continues thanks to De Bruyne.\n\nIlkay Gundogan laid the ball off for De Bruyne, who thrashed a shot past his Belgium team-mate Courtois. Having also netted in 2020, De Bruyne is the first player in Champions League history to score in separate away games against Real in the knockout stages.\n\nCity - who did not make any substitutions - never had a chance to win the game, with that their last shot. Next week they will hope to see 51-goal Haaland get more joy in front of goal.\n\nMadrid's aura in the Champions League is something special. They are not the defending champions - and 14-time winners - by accident.\n\nDomestically they sit 14 points behind champions elect Barcelona, with Atletico Madrid also above them.\n\nBut they have won five Champions League titles in nine years, with two of them coming in seasons they finished third.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's side came into this game on a good bit of domestic news, having won the Copa del Rey final against Osasuna on Saturday.\n\nBut this is where Real thrive - often against English clubs too. This is the sixth knockout tie in a row in which they have faced an English team - and they have won the other five.\n\nThe first half was a smash and grab to some extent with Vinicius' goal coming from their first real attack. Only Haaland (13 - 12 goals, one assist) has been involved in more Champions League goals than Vinicius this season (12 - seven goals, five assists).\n\nThey grew into the game in the second half, with De Bruyne giving them a taste of their own medicine by scoring after the end of a good spell for Real.\n\nCamavinga, who set up their goal, gave the ball away to Rodri in the build-up, highlighting the pros and cons of playing a central midfielder at left-back.\n\nMadrid boss Ancelotti was booked for his angry reaction to the goal, claiming the ball went out of play in the build-up.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"\n\nMadeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.\n\nThe Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"\n\nBut providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\".\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.\n\nBPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"\n\nShe said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year.\n\nA spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".\n\nThey added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"\n\nDowning Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"\n\n\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nDame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"\n\nThe CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation.\n\nHer defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\"\n\nFoster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later.\n\nThe 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.\n\nSentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.\n\nHe said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.\n\nBut he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".\n\nAhead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.\n\nThe judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".\n\nBut he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\".", "They were put to one side for a while, as shock and national unity followed the 7 October attacks by Hamas - but six months later, thousands of protesters are once again on Israel's streets.\n\nThe war has turbocharged their determination to unseat Israel's longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn Jerusalem, police used skunk water - a foul-smelling substance fired from water cannons - to clear protesters who had blocked the Begin Boulevard, the city's major north-south highway.\n\nWell-worn slogans demanding his resignation and early elections were amplified by newer ones calling for an immediate deal to free about 130 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. An unknown number of them are presumed dead.\n\nThe big fear of their families and friends, as well as the protesters, is that many more will die the longer the war drags on without a deal.\n\nOn Sunday evening, as thousands packed the broad avenues around the Israeli parliament, Katia Amorza - who has a son serving in the Israeli army in Gaza - put down her megaphone for a moment.\n\n\"Since eight this morning, I'm here. And now I'm telling Netanyahu that I would be glad to pay one way ticket, first class, for him to go out and not come back anymore.\n\nProtester Katia called for Netanyahu to step down outside the Knesset building\n\n\"And I'm telling him also to take with him all those people that they put in the government that he chose one by one, the worst, the worst that we have in our society.\"\n\nA rabbi crossed the road past Katia and her megaphone. It was Yehudah Glick, who campaigns for Jewish prayer in the area Israelis call the Temple Mount, the site in Jerusalem of Islam's third holiest mosque, al Aqsa.\n\nRabbi Glick said the protesters have forgotten that their real enemy is Hamas, not prime minister Netanyahu.\n\n\"I think he's very popular. And that's what aggravates these people. I think these people, are not willing to forgive the fact that for so long they've been demonstrating against him and he's still in power.\n\n\"And I'm calling upon them to demonstrate, to come and demonstrate, speak loud and clear what they feel, but to be careful not to cross the very thin line between democracy and anarchy.\"\n\nThe protesters, and Mr Netanyahu's critics in countries that otherwise support Israel, believe the enemies of democracy are already in his government, a coalition that depends on the support of ultranationalist Jewish parties.\n\nAmong them is the Religious Zionism party, led by the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich. One of its MPs, Ohad Tal, said it was \"na\u00efve\" to believe anything other than more military pressure on Hamas would free the hostages.\n\n\"You don't think Hamas will bring back so easily the hostages in a deal, release everybody and then will allow us to, you know, to kill all the terrorists that we would release in such a deal... It's not as simple.\n\n\"If there was a button that you can press and bring back all the hostages and make everything okay, every Israeli would press this button. But it's not as easy as you may think.\"\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu used to say he was the only one who could keep his country safe. Many Israelis believed him.\n\nHe said that he could manage the Palestinians, settle Jews on the occupied land they want for a state, without offering the concessions and making the sacrifices necessary for a peace deal.\n\nAll that changed on 7 October last year when Hamas stormed through the border wire.\n\nMany Israelis hold him responsible for the security lapses that allowed Hamas to attack Israel with such devastating effect.\n\nUnlike his security chiefs, who rapidly issued statements admitting they had made mistakes, Mr Netanyahu has never admitted any responsibility.\n\nThat infuriates the thousands who blocked streets in Jerusalem on Sunday evening.\n\nIsraelis must be something like 40 years old at least to remember a time when Benjamin Netanyahu was not a dominant figure in their country's politics.\n\nAfter emerging as an eloquent spokesman for Israel at the United Nations, his first stint as prime minister came after a narrow victory in 1996 on a platform opposing the Oslo peace process.\n\nLike the current American plan to make peace in the Middle East, the Oslo deals were built around the idea that allowing Palestinians to establish an independent state alongside Israel was the only hope of ending a century of conflict between Arabs and Jews over control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nMr Netanyahu has been a consistent opponent of a Palestinian state. He has contemptuously dismissed the US strategy of backing for Palestinian independence as part of a \"grand bargain\" to remake the Middle East.\n\nHis critics here say his strident rejection of President Joe Biden's plans for governance in Gaza after the war is a tool to secure the continued support of Israel's extreme right wing.\n\nOne of the protesters outside the Knesset was David Agmon, a retired Brigadier General in the Israeli army. He ran the prime minister's office when Mr Netanyahu was first elected.\n\n\"It's the biggest crisis ever since 1948. I'll tell you something else. I was the first chief of staff for Netanyahu in 1996, so I know him, and after three months I decided to leave. Because I realised who he is - a danger to Israel.\n\n\"He doesn't know how to take decisions, he is afraid, the only thing he knows is to speak. And of course, I saw he depends on his wife, and I saw his lies. And after three months I told him, 'Bibi, you don't need aides, you need a replacement.'

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the military could either join the Russian army, go home or go to Belarus.\n\nThe base seen in the satellite images is about 13 miles (21km) from the town of Asipovichy - around 64 miles from the capital Minsk. The area has been reported in Russian media as a place which could house Wagner fighters.\n\nMr Lukashenko has offered to accommodate Wagner fighters in his country, where it is believed Prigozhin has gone into exile.\n\nThe Belarusian leader also mentioned an abandoned military base but did not specify the location, saying: \"There is a fence, everything is available, erect your tents.\"\n\nThere has since been speculation about a site near Asipovichy which used to be home Belarus' 465th Missile Brigade before they relocated in 2018.\n\nThe image taken on 27 June is low resolution, so saying exactly what has been constructed there is difficult, but there's clearly been development since mid-June.\n\nYou can see several lines of rectangular structures which look to be consistent with tents seen at other military bases in the region.\n\nIt's unclear who was responsible for these structures being erected.\n\nUkrainian military expert Oleg Zhdanov told Radio Free Europe it was \"unrealistic\" for Wagner troops to have started building a camp with so little time passing since the rebellion.\n\nBut Marina Miron, a researcher specialising in the Russian military at the Department of War Studies at King's College London, said it was possible.\n\n\"It [Wagner] is not like an army where everything is slow... if they managed to get halfway to Moscow within one day it is plausible to think they might already be starting to build camps in Belarus,\" she said.", "It is understood those targeted are Bulgarian and Portugese\n\nWindows at a number of houses have been smashed in a racially-motivated hate crime in Ballymena, County Antrim, police have said.\n\nIt is understood the homes of four Bulgarian families and one Portuguese family were attacked.\n\nOfficers were called to Larne Street at about 02:15 BST on Monday.\n\nThe suspect is described as being a man of stocky build, wearing dark shorts and an orange top.\n\nWindows were smashed at a number of properties in the street\n\nPolice said they will be increasing patrols in the area following the attack and urged anyone with information to get in touch.\n\n\"Everyone has the right to feel safe in their home,\" added Insp Reid.", "Tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have been joking about setting up a cage match. In the business world, the fight has already begun.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Mr Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media.\n\nThat's still a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of Twitter users.\n\nBut analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them.\n\nAfter all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling adverts - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts.\n\n\"Our approach will be the same as all our other products: make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point,\" he wrote.\n\nBut eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.\n\nThat's not huge. But it's also not nothing, especially as the company continues to look for ways to combat the hit to ad sales sparked by stricter privacy rules from Apple.\n\nAnd it is well within striking distance of Twitter, which generated $4.5bn in ad revenue in 2021, before Mr Musk's takeover sparked upheaval.\n\nWhether that money materialises will depend on what Threads becomes, if anything, in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nMr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.\n\nBut frustration with Twitter has left plenty of people hungry for an alternative; and Meta's promise of a \"saner, kinder place\" than Twitter \"supercharged\" early sign-ups, Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said.\n\n\"Posting. With optimism,\" quipped Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the celebrities jumping into the fray alongside Shakira, Oprah and Khloe Kardashian.\n\nSuccess will depend on winning over Twitter's power users or people who never signed up for the app in the first place - no sure bet, analysts said.\n\nThough the fashion and lifestyle content that is the bread-and-butter of Instagram clearly holds appeal for advertisers, it is not clear the world needs another platform to consume it.\n\nMr Zuckerberg also has a complicated relationship with news, one of Twitter's main functions.\n\nHe has said surveys show users want less of it on the platforms he runs and in Canada, his company is preparing to block local reporting, rather than pay news providers there for their content.\n\n\"News hounds and avid Twitter loyalists aren't likely to defect... and Meta will need to keep Threads interesting to maintain the momentum once the novelty wears off,\" Ms Enberg said, adding that Mr Zuckerberg - who has been skewered before for creating copycat products - has \"struggled\" with innovation.\n\nAdvertisers will also be looking for confidence that they are not spending money on a platform exposing them to risks tied to issues like misinformation and privacy.\n\nUnder Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see.\n\nAnalysts say Meta has already been one of the beneficiaries from Twitter losing business.\n\nBut Mr Zuckerberg is not coming to the table with a clean record either.\n\nHis company has clashed with marketers for years over the transparency and accuracy of its data, while its handling of user data and misinformation has drawn widespread criticism.\n\n\"Advertisers want a clean ... well-lit environment where content is moderated on the terms and conditions agreed to, on a consistent basis,\" said marketing veteran Lou Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory. \"Overall right now social media is a bit of a dumpster fire.\"\n\nMeta shares popped 4% on Wednesday ahead of the launch - a sign of investor confidence that Mr Zuckerberg has the ability to make it work, despite flops like Facebook Dating.\n\nBut replicating the way that news breaks on Twitter will be difficult, Mr Paskalis said, leaving room for both platforms to exist.\n\nOr, he suggested, the presence of a serious threat could prove a \"wake-up call\" for Mr Musk.\n\n\"One of the keys will be how long will Threads eschew advertising,\" Mr Paskalis said. \"Whatever that period of time is, that's the period of time that Twitter has to right that ship.\"", "The battle to learn lessons and defend reputations over Covid was always going to be intense, angry and passionate.\n\nThe focus for that, primarily, was expected to be the public inquiry, which is currently at its very early stages.\n\nThe simple political truth is the court of public opinion is opening and hearing evidence now, and will continue to in the coming days, via revelations in The Daily Telegraph.\n\nAnd an argument now rages over fairness.\n\nIs it fair that the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was given this huge tranche of WhatsApp exchanges by Matt Hancock to help him write a book about the pandemic, has now decided to reveal them, breaching his trust, and, Mr Hancock claims, a non-disclosure agreement?\n\nOr, is it fair that these messages - which I'm told had already been given to the public inquiry - should remain private potentially for years prior to the inquiry's report, or maybe forever?\n\nThe Telegraph's report provides a fascinating insight, partial though it clearly is, into how people under the professional pressure of their lives dealt with these colossal issues confronting them.\n\nWe see, in a raw, unfiltered way, the nature and tone of their interactions, the rapidly changing evidence and arguments about what was deliverable.\n\nIsabel Oakeshott argues she is performing an important public service by publishing these exchanges now.\n\nMatt Hancock says what she has done is outrageous, partial and driven by an anti-lockdown agenda from her and the newspaper.\n\nI am told the Telegraph has been working on this for around two months.\n\nIt reminds me of the same paper's rolling revelations on MPs' expenses in 2009: a steady flow, day after day, of stories that dominated Westminster's agenda, forever moulding the reputation of many, many figures in politics.\n\nHere -

which aims to stop small boat Channel crossings - was published on Wednesday.\n\nThe proposed law would put a duty on the government to detain and remove people arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.\n\nMigrants would not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made passing the law one of his key five priorities, however it is likely to face obstacles - both political and legal.\n\nFor example individuals could challenge their detention and removal from the UK by taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, Ms Braverman was asked if she was tempted to follow the example of previous governments which tried to ignore the court's rulings on giving prisoners the vote.\n\n\"There are important questions to be asked about whether the balance has been properly struck,\" she replied.\n\n\"I would say it's a court which is politicised, it is interventionist and it doesn't always follow a process that we would recognise as being due process.\n\n\"In a whole range of policy areas, I think sometimes the jurisprudence from the Strasbourg court is at odds with the will of Parliament or British values more generally.\"\n\nShe emphasised that the new Illegal Migrants Bill would not be taking the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights - the set of rules interpreted by the court.\n\nWriting to Conservative MPs after the bill was published, she said there was \"more than a 50% chance\" the legislation was not compatible with the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nShe said ministers wanted to test the boundaries of legal obligations - but believed their plans were within those limits.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, French MEP Nathalie Loiseau cautioned that cooperation between the UK and EU depended on the UK sticking to the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n\"If you read the trade and cooperation agreement between the UK and the EU, which was signed and ratified on both sides, every single piece of judicial cooperation relies on a full commitment to the ECHR,\" she said.\n\nLabour's Yvette Cooper has said the government's plans would make \"the problems even worse, and make it more chaotic\", putting more lives \"at risk\".\n\nThe United Nations refugee agency has described the moves as \"very concerning\".\n\nMr Sunak has said the measures are \"tough, but necessary and fair\" and added that he is \"up for the fight\" over the legislation.", "China has distanced itself from the remarks of one of its envoys who questioned the sovereignty of Ukraine and other former Soviet countries.\n\nParis ambassador Lu Shaye's comments last week caused widespread outrage, leading on calls to Beijing to clarify.\n\nOn Monday, China's foreign ministry said it respected the independence of all post-Soviet republics.\n\nChina is a major ally of Russia and has not condemned President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nIt sees itself as a major player in attempts to bring peace to Ukraine, but has become an increasingly important trading partner for Russia amid Western sanctions prompted by the invasion, and many in the West doubt its impartiality on the issue.\n\nIn an interview for the French LCI network last week, Ambassador Lu was asked China's view of the status of Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nThe interviewer argued that under international law the region was part of Ukraine.\n\nMr Lu responded by suggesting that the issue was not clear cut, and that countries such as Ukraine could not rely on international law to defend their sovereignty.\n\n\"Even these former Soviet countries don't have an effective status under international law because there is no international agreement under international law to concretise their status as sovereign countries,\" he said.\n\nPresident Putin has frequently challenged Ukrainian independence. In a speech days before the start of Russia's invasion last year, he denied Ukraine had any \"real statehood\" and said the country was an integral part of Russia's history and culture.\n\nOn Monday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning rejected Mr Lu's position, saying Beijing respected the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries and upheld the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\nShe said that while \"the Soviet Union was a federal state and had the status of an entity of international law in its entirety in foreign affairs... this does not deny the fact that each member republic of the Soviet Union has the status of a sovereign state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union\".\n\nLater the Chinese embassy in Paris said in a statement quoted by AFP that Mr Lu's remarks were a personal point of view and should not be over-interpreted.\n\nThree Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have summoned China's representatives to clarify Mr Lu's comments.\n\nLithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said, quoted by AFP, that the diplomats would be asked to explain if the Chinese position had changed on independence and reminded that \"we're not post-Soviet countries but we're the countries that were illegally occupied by Soviet Union\".\n\nThe three countries were seized by the USSR in 1940 and only achieved independence in 1991 as it was collapsing.\n\nOther European Union foreign ministers condemned the remarks, and were set to discuss them at a meeting of the 27-member bloc on Monday.\n\nUkrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak also questioned Mr Lu's interpretation of international law and described his take on Crimea as \"absurd\".\n\n\"If you want to be a major political player, do not parrot the propaganda of Russian outsiders,\" he said on Sunday.\n\nMr Lu has caused controversy in the past, and is known as one of the \"Wolf Warriors\" of Chinese diplomacy for his abrasive style.\n\nHe told French media in June 2021 that he was \"honoured\" to be given this title because there were so many \"mad hyenas attacking China\".\n\nHe has several times been

indications that the cuts could hit 20% were alarming.\n\nIt has written to Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, asking him for urgent clarity on the budget.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris is due to set the budget for Stormont departments in the absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Executive.\n\nOn Tuesday his spokesman said he hoped to be in a position to agree the budget \"as soon as

week.\n\nThere had been speculation the Northern Ireland Office was preparing to produce it within days.\n\nHowever, quizzed by MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs committee, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would deliver it \"as soon as I can\".\n\nAsked by SDLP MP Claire Hanna if that meant \"days or weeks\", he replied: \"Never give a timeline to anything in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nHe added that it would be set \"in very short order\".\n\nThe Public Sector Chairs' Forum represents public bodies operating under all of Stormont's departments and includes the Education Authority and health and social care trusts.\n\nIts chair, Nicole Lappin, said public bodies had never before been faced with such a significant budget crisis and were deeply concerned about the effect a major reduction would have.\n\n\"What [Mr Heaton-Harris] has given us are indicative allocations which indicate cuts of up to 20% across the public sector,\" she said.\n\n\"That is something that we cannot work

come.\n\n\"All of those cuts will have an impact on the longer-term progress of the Northern Ireland economy.\"\n\nShe urged the UK government to help Stormont to \"get its public finances on to a more sustainable footing\".\n\nHer comments come two days after a former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service said the forthcoming budgets cuts would be \"undeliverable\".\n\nDavid Sterling described the spending crisis as \"the worst that it has been\".\n\n\"I think public services and departments are collateral damage in the struggle the government is having to get the institutions up and running again,\" he said.\n\nMost Stormont departments could have to deal with substantial cuts to their budgets\n\nThe Northern Ireland Office said Mr Heaton-Harris had \"worked intensively\" with the civil service to prepare the budget.\n\nBut it added: \"The secretary of state and Northern Ireland permanent secretaries should not be taking these decisions.\n\n\"It is time for Northern Ireland parties to get back to work and take the decisions for the people of Northern Ireland.\"\n\nJill Rutter, of the Institute for Government thinktank, said Mr Heaton-Harris was using the budget as a tactic to \"pressurise the [Stormont] parties to get back into power-sharing\".\n\nShe also said that civil servants were being put in an increasingly difficult position the longer they had to wait to find out how big the cuts would be.\n\n\"We're already well into the first month of the financial year - the more time you lose the harder it is to budget properly,\" said Ms Rutter.\n\n\"If you have to do things in a real rush... you may have consequences that you could have avoided if you'd been able to plan over a year.\n\n\"This year is going to be very difficult on public spending

But 149 chose to enter the country and are now in quarantine hotels due to their own free will!\"\n\nMr Hancock also wrote: \"We are giving big families all the suites and putting pop stars in the box rooms.\"\n\nMr Case replied: \"I just want to see some of the faces of people coming out of first class into a Premier Inn shoe box.\"\n\nPeople affected by the policy at the time described the way it was implemented as a \"mess\" and being kept in a hotel as like living in a \"prison\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nIn an earlier exchange, on 28 August 2020, Mr Case, then the Downing Street permanent secretary, asked Mr Hancock \"who actually is delivering enforcement\", apparently during a discussion about lockdowns.\n\nMr Hancock replied: \"I think we are going to have to get heavy with the police.\"\n\nIn another message in January 2021, Mr Hancock appears to be describing what was talked about at a meeting of senior figures, including the prime minister.\n\nAfter summarising a discussion about the enforcement of lockdown, he says: \"The plod got their marching orders.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, the police were often criticised for enforcing lockdown rules in a way that many considered over-zealous, with fines issued to dog walkers and protesters.\n\nBut surveys at the time suggested most people supported how the police were enforcing the new rules.\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the exchanges revealed the \"arrogance and shameful lack of respect\" of ministers towards the police.\n\n\"At the same time as they were flagrantly breaking the law themselves with their lockdown parties, they were demanding stronger enforcement by the police on everyone else.\"\n\nThe Police Federation of England and Wales said Mr Hancock's messages showed a \"total lack of respect\" for officers at the heart of the government.\n\nSteve Hartshorn, national chairman of the organisation which represents more than 130,000 rank-and-file officers said police put \"their lives and the lives of their families on the line\" during the pandemic.\n\n\"So, to discover that then government ministers referred to them as 'plod' who 'got their marching orders' is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nSimon Case has been cabinet secretary, the most senior position in the civil service, since 2020\n\nMs Oakeshott has defended her decision to share the WhatsApp messages, saying she did so \"in the overwhelming public interest\" because no deadline has been set for the UK's public inquiry and she feared results could \"potentially\" take 10 years.\n\nPressed on whether she was considering sharing information with the public while she was helping Mr Hancock write his book, she said: \"If you're asking me, was I secretly plotting to do something quite different at the end of the project, the answer to that is no.\n\n\"If you're asking me, was I as a journalist intrigued about what else might be lurking in there, the answer is yes\", she told BBC Breakfast.\n\nThe text leak also shows that in March 2021, Mr Hancock also texted then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson a link to a news article about two people who were fined \u00a310,000 each for failing to quarantine after returning from Dubai.\n\nOther leaked messages reported by The Telegraph appear to show:\n\nThe Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said: \"This lifts the lid on the contempt that Boris Johnson and his Conservative cronies had for the British public during the pandemic.\n\n\"They mocked and joked while breaking the rules we were all required to follow.\n\n\"The Covid inquiry must be able to get to the bottom of this sorry saga in our country's history as soon as possible.

US officials previously said it was unlikely a foreign power was to blame.\n\nBut in their assessment of \"anomalous health incidents\" (AHIs) - which was delivered last year - they did not give any alternative explanation, frustrating those who have been affected.\n\nThe American officials also acknowledged there were varying levels of confidence in the assessment between the different intelligence agencies involved.\n\nThe phenomenon gets its name from Cuba's capital Havana - where the first case was detected in 2016 - though the new report suggests the first cases may have happened in Germany two years earlier.\n\nOther cases have been reported around the world, from Washington to China.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said that a senior defence department official attending meetings at last year's Nato summit in Lithuania had experienced symptoms similar to Havana syndrome.\n\nAmerican personnel struck with the condition - including White House, CIA and FBI staff - have complained of dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating and an intense and painful sound in their ears.\n\nMore than 1,000 reports of the mysterious ailment have been made, with dozens of cases still officially considered unexplained. US lawmakers have passed legislation aimed at supporting victims.\n\nHowever, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study published last month said MRI scans had failed to detect evidence of brain injuries in dozens of US personnel who reported AHIs.\n\nThere has long been a suspicion that those affected have been hit by directed energy or microwaves fired from hidden devices - a possibility that was acknowledged in an earlier US intelligence report.\n\nThe fresh media investigation alleges that members of a specific Russian military intelligence unit - known as 29155 - may have targeted the brains of US diplomats with \"directed energy\" weapons.\n\nIt says there is evidence that places members of the unit in cities around the world at times when US personnel reported incidents.\n\nThe secretive unit undertakes foreign operations and has been linked to incidents including the attempted poisoning in the UK in 2018 of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy.\n\nAs part of the investigation, The Insider - a Russia-focused site - reported that an officer in the 29155 unit had been rewarded for their work related to the development of \"non-lethal acoustic weapons\".\n\nAn American military investigator examining instances of the syndrome told 60 Minutes that the common link between victims of the syndrome was a \"Russia nexus\".\n\nGreg Edgreen explained: \"There was some angle where they had worked against Russia, focused on Russia, and done extremely well.\"\n\nHe also said the official US bar of proof to show Russian involvement had been set too high, as his country did not want to \"face some very hard truths\".\n\nIn response to the media investigation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"No one has ever published or expressed any convincing evidence of these unfounded accusations anywhere. So, all of those are nothing more than unfounded accusations.\"\n\nOne victim of the syndrome - an FBI agent - told 60 Minutes about her experience of being hit by a powerful force at her home in Florida 2021.\n\n\"Bam, inside my right ear, it was like a dentist drilling on steroids,\" she told the programme. \"That feeling when it gets too close to your eardrum? It's like that, times 10.\"\n\nThe woman - known as Carrie - said she ultimately passed out, and later had issues with memory and concentration.\n\nResponding to the report, US officials told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that they would \"continue to closely examine anomalous health incidents\", but repeated their position that it was \"very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible\".\n\nBut they said they did \"not call into question the very real experiences and symptoms that our colleagues and their family members have reported\", saying their work on such incidents was a priority.\n\nJohn Bolton, who served as Donald Trump's national security adviser, said the new allegations are \"very concerning\".\n\n\"I don't think the government, frankly, when I was there, took it seriously, enough,\" he told CNN. \"I don't think they've taken it seriously enough since then,\"\n\nBut Republican Senator JD Vance, a top Trump ally, rubbished the report, writing on X: \"Feels like a lot of journalists have lost their minds\".\n\nBBC World Service - What in the World: What's causing Havana Syndrome?", "Low traffic neighbourhoods aim to reduce traffic and encourage people to walk, cycle or use public transport\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has ordered a review of low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in England, saying that he is on the side of drivers.\n\nHe told the Sunday Telegraph he was supporting people to \"use their cars to do all the things that matter to them\".\n\nHis remarks form part of a sharpening debate on green policies following last week's by-elections.\n\nLTNs aim to reduce traffic, in part by preventing drivers using quieter residential roads as through-routes.\n\nSome research suggests they reduce localised pollution. But critics, including some Conservatives MPs, argue they harm the freedom of motorists and push traffic onto other roads, causing congestion.\n\nIn his Sunday Telegraph interview, Mr Sunak also said he was not planning to change the deadline for the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesels cars despite calls from some Conservatives to do so.\n\nIn a letter to Mr Sunak on Saturday, a group of 43 Conservative MPs and peers including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Jacob Rees Mogg and David Davis, suggested moving the target to 2035 to avoid \"grave harm to the economy\".\n\nIt read: \"The public can only be left worse off by a heavy-handed ban that leaves them unable to purchase the vehicles they want.\n\n\"The future for this country is in imposing fewer burdens and being more lightly regulated than the EU, not in unilaterally imposing additional job-destroying burdens to meet an unnecessary and unworkable deadline.\"\n\nBut Mr Sunak said: \"The 2030 target has been our policy for a long time and continues to be - we are not considering a delay to that date.\"\n\nLTNs have been set up in recent years in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Bournemouth and more cities, with tens of millions of pounds of government funding given to councils for them since 2020.\n\nIn 2022 authorities around the country told iNews that nearly 200 had been installed over a two-year period, with about 50 scrapped.\n\nTheir aim to encourage people to walk, cycle or use public transport through the use of barriers such as bollards and planters, as well as road signs and CCTV cameras.\n\nMr Sunak said he had ordered the Department for Transport to see how LTNs were working. Earlier this month, Transport Secretary Mark Harper announced that the government was stopping the funding of new LTNs in England.\n\nIt is not clear whether the government could make councils alter or scrap existing schemes.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"The vast majority of people in the country use their cars to get around and are dependent on cars.\n\n\"I just want to make sure people know that I'm on their side in supporting them to use their cars to do all the things that matter to them,\" he said.\n\nThe adoption of LTNs has attracted the ire of some Tory MPs, who have criticised the measure as an attack on motorists.\n\nConservative MP Nick Fletcher described them earlier this year as being part of an \"international socialist concept\" that take away personal liberties.\n\nLabour's Louise Haigh accused the Conservatives of \"pure hypocrisy\" for accelerating and funding LTN's before \"denouncing\" the policy.\n\nThe shadow transport secretary said road safety measures were often demanded by local communities so the decisions must be properly consulted on and made by them.\n\nThe Local Government Association, which represents local councils, said the review was \"unnecessary\" and councils were best placed to make decisions with their communities.\n\nIt said councils needed long-term certainty over funding if they were to help meet the government's own target of 50% of urban journeys being walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.\n\nThe review will only look at LTNs in England, as they are a devolved matter in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nIt comes as intense heatwaves worldwide and climate change warnings propel the UK's net zero target to the top of the political agenda.\n\nThe target, set for 2050, is to no longer add to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nThe UK's strategy includes generating all electricity from clean sources, switching gas boilers for heat pumps and banning new petrol and diesel cars.\n\nWithin the Conservative Party, however, there are internal divisions over green policies and some MPs are calling for a rethink.\n\nIn the coming week, Mr Sunak will meet energy leaders to set out details of his plans for the UK fossil fuel and green industries.\n\nOn Saturday, environment groups warned Mr Sunak they will not \"stand by\" while politicians use the environment as a \"political football\".\n\nIn last week's Uxbridge by-election, the Tories capitalised on voters' anger over Labour London mayor Sadiq Khan's plans to extend the capital's ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), a key factor in their victory.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer blamed his party's defeat on the planned Ulez expansion - and Mr Sunak has urged Mr Khan to \"think twice\" on the expansion.\n\nUlez was introduced by former London Mayor Boris Johnson, but Mr Khan has sought to expand the scheme further into London as part of his efforts to improve air quality in the capital.\n\nEarlier this week the High Court ruled plans to expand Ulez were lawful, saying the mayor's expansion decision was \"within his powers\".\n\nCity Hall has said that 90% of cars driving in outer London comply with Ulez standards, which has been backed by the UK Statistics Authority - although the watchdog criticised the mayor over data transparency.\n\nIn the Sunday Telegraph interview, Mr Sunak said the scheme effectively levies charges to \"take your kids to football practice or do your weekly shop or see a GP\".", "Last week Nadine Dorries said she would resign her Mid Bedfordshire seat with immediate effect\n\nFormer cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has not yet officially resigned as an MP, to the frustration of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe close Boris Johnson ally announced last Friday she would be standing down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire \"with immediate effect\".\n\nBut she is yet to officially tender her resignation - putting a by-election to replace her on hold.\n\nNo 10 said it was important for her constituents to have \"certainty\".\n\n\"It's obviously unusual to have an MP say they will resign with immediate effect and for that not to take place,\" the prime minister's press secretary added.\n\nMs Dorries announced she would be standing down as an MP, shortly before it was confirmed she would not become a member of the House of Lords in Mr Johnson's resignation honours list.\n\nShe has since accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's political team of removing her name from the list - something No 10 denies.\n\nNigel Adams, another MP close to Boris Johnson who was reported to be in the running for a peerage but whose name was not on the list either, has also announced he is quitting.\n\nAs Ms Dorries remains a member of Parliament, she can turn up in the House of Commons chamber to make her views known.\n\nAnything she says would be covered by parliamentary privilege, allowing her to be outspoken on any issue, without fear of legal consequences.\n\nMr Johnson also announced he was leaving Parliament on Friday, ahead of a Commons report expected to accuse him of misleading MPs over the Partygate scandal, which is due to be published on Thursday.\n\nThe former prime minister has denounced the committee writing the report as a \"kangaroo court\" determined to \"drive me out of Parliament\".\n\nUnlike Ms Dorries, both Mr Johnson and Mr Adams have officially resigned their seats, in Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Selby and Ainsty respectively.\n\nThe by-elections to replace them were triggered on Wednesday, with 3 July or 20 July the possible polling dates.\n\nIf Ms Dorries's formal resignation is tendered soon, it could still be possible for all three by-elections to be held on 20 July.\n\nBut while she keeps her party waiting, the capacity for mischief exists.\n\nOn Wednesday, the PM's press secretary said Rishi Sunak \"believes the people of Mid Bedfordshire deserve proper representation in [the Commons], and he looks forward to campaigning for the Conservative candidate in the by-election\".\n\nA Conservative Party source said: \"We don't know why Nadine hasn't resigned.\n\n\"But we don't want to hang around, we want to get on with those things.\"\n\nThe Conservatives - who are trailing Labour in national polls - wanted to conclude swift campaigns before Parliament's summer recess and for any political pain from the by-elections to be short and sharp.\n\nBut if Ms Dorries keeps her party waiting, she could force them into a potentially divisive by-election later on - for example, ahead of the autumn party conference season.", "Labour MP Jess Phillips is not racist, shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, following a social media row involving Ms Phillips and a prominent headteacher.\n\nKatharine Birbalsingh - from the Michaela Community School - has accused Ms Phillips of racism and bullying.\n\nOn Sunday, Ms Phillipson said Ms Birbalsingh should raise any concerns through a formal parliamentary process.\n\nMs Birbalsingh had already written to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nThe Twitter row began after Ms Birbalsingh posted a picture in May of the late popstar Tina Turner alongside Ms Turner's abusive ex-husband, Ike Turner, with the caption: \"Good times.\"\n\nIn response, Ms Phillips, who is shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, wrote: \"Domestic abuse is never OK and we will defeat those who prop up the status quo.\"\n\nShortly afterwards Ms Birbalsingh deleted the tweet, then posted: \"To the lunatics accusing me of celebrating wife beating - I tweeted a gif with a number of photos of Tina.\n\n\"For some reason it rested on one photo which I didn't notice when I tweeted... nor did I know that was Ike.\"\n\nShe added that \"the explanation is not that I like wife beating\".\n\nLater that same day - 24 May - Ms Phillips wrote on Twitter: \"Seems that far from holding any kind of line that headteacher woman seems not to be able to take criticism of her actions. I'd be keen to hear of domestic abuse policies she has in her school or teaching plans, perhaps I'll write.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Ms Birbalsingh posted an open letter to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on her Twitter account, writing that Ms Phillips' behaviour was \"a clear example of 'unconscious bias'\".\n\nIn the four-page letter, she wrote that Ms Phillips \"hates me, despite not knowing me, because she subscribes to the idea that black and Asian individuals in public life owe a duty to voice opinions that match with a left wing view of the world, or they are worthy of her contempt\".\n\nMs Birbalsingh said that she was not suggesting Ms Phillips \"hates all people of colour\".\n\nShe added that Ms Phillips called into question her school's safeguarding policies \"in a deliberate attempt to challenge my competence as a headteacher\".\n\nShe said that after Ms Phillips' tweets, people contacted her institution saying it was \"unsafe for female teachers and pupils\". She said the Teaching Regulation Agency had been contacted with a demand that she be struck off.\n\nAsked on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether she thought Ms Phillips was racist, Ms Phillipson said: \"No, I don't.

James Anderson, backed to play in this Test despite taking only four wickets in the series, bowled seven unsuccessful overs.\n\nAt 2-1 down, England know Australia have retained the urn, but are looking to protect an unbeaten home record in Ashes series that stretches back to 2001.\n\u2022 None Pick your team of the series\n\u2022 None Brook could have same impact as Pietersen - Vaughan\n\u2022 None Relive day one as it happened\n\nBrook made his Test debut on this ground a year ago and has since established himself as the present and future of England's middle order. On this occasion he was the engine of a freewheeling England innings with his 11th score of 50 or more in 12 Tests.\n\nThe hosts thrilled and frustrated in equal measure. An opening stand of 62 between Crawley and Ben Duckett, who was busy for 41, belied the early conditions before both men and Joe Root fell in the space of 22 balls. Root's was the first in a string of limp dismissals from the middle and lower order.\n\nDuckett and Crawley both benefitted from being dropped and England would have been in huge trouble at 78-4 had Brook been held by diving wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Reprieved, he built the vital stand with Moeen.\n\nMoeen had been careful, scoring only 11 from 37 balls, before his injury. With restricted movement, he swung two sixes off Cummins before aiming one heave too many at recalled off-spinner Todd Murphy.\n\nBy this point, Brook was batting gloriously, scoring square of the wicket on both sides, playing handsome straight drives and picking up two leg-side sixes of his own.\n\nHowever, Moeen's dismissal sparked England's second mini-slump. Ben Stokes played across a very good delivery from Starc, Jonny Bairstow wafted an ugly chop on off Josh Hazlewood and Brook's airy drive ended in the hands of Steve Smith.\n\nEven after that, Woakes and Mark Wood continued the momentum. Wood sped to 28 before a hack at Murphy and Woakes, who was dropped twice and successfully overturned being given lbw, lofted a glorious straight six off Starc in his 36.\n\nAustralia have been on the back foot for most of the past two Tests and looked to still be suffering a hangover in a poor first hour when they wasted the conditions. Starc and Hazlewood were wayward with the new ball, Warner dropped Duckett at first slip and a flying Smith put down a very tough chance off Crawley.\n\nBut an excellent spell from captain Pat Cummins changed the momentum. After Mitchell Marsh had Duckett caught down the leg side, Cummins got his reward with extra bounce to Crawley and Australia gradually chipped away.\n\nIn the face of England's swift scoring, Australia kept the field spread and the boundaries protected.\n\nThough Cummins' throw missed the chance to run out Brook, the tourists had the fortune of the injury that contributed to Moeen's downfall and Starc followed up with a wonderful burst in the afternoon - the ball that bowled Stokes nipped away sharply to take off stump.\n\nWith the help of Murphy, it was Starc who mopped up the tail after tea, giving Australia around two hours to bat.\n\nWarner had failed to score when a tickle down the leg side off Stuart Broad went away off Bairstow's fingertips, a very hard chance. Warner also survived a review for caught behind off Broad and an edge off Wood that dropped short of Bairstow.\n\nThe opening stand was worth 49 when Warner fenced at Woakes, allowing Crawley to take the smart catch. Khawaja remained unmoved, leaving well and showing all the sound judgement that has made him Australia's leading run-scorer in the series.\n\n'We got up to a respectable total' - what they said?\n\nEngland batter Harry Brook, speaking to BBC's Test Match Special: \"We got up to a respectable total. I felt good today, I got that bit of luck early on, I just tried to put that pressure back on them and play like I have the last 12 months: positive, looking to always put the pressure on, backing myself.\"\n\nAustralia spinner Todd Murphy, speaking to Sky Sports: \"Winning the toss and bowling, the first objective is to bowl them out. We managed to do that, we created a lot of chances - it would've been nice if we could've held on to all of them but it's a good day, all in all. To be 61-1 at the end is nice.\"", "Adele Okojie-Aidonojie was found guilty of causing the deaths of two friends\n\nA woman has been jailed for 11 years for killing a couple who had been standing up \"twerking\" in the back of her car moments before it crashed.\n\nAdele Okojie-Aidonojie, 23, had been drinking alcohol and driving at more than double the speed limit when her Mini Cooper convertible overturned in Battersea, south London.\n\nRida Boutjettif, 24, and Mary Macharia, 23, were flung from the vehicle.\n\nThey died at the scene and a third passenger, Ben Sidibe, was injured.\n\nFollowing a trial at the Old Bailey, student Okojie-Aidonojie, from Bromley, was found guilty of two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and one of causing injury by dangerous driving.\n\nJurors heard the speed limit on Latchmere Road, Battersea, was 30mph\n\nJudge Richard Marks KC described her conduct as \"sheer madness\", adding: \"Especially [as] moments before the collision, your two passengers to your knowledge had been standing up dancing.\"\n\nHe rejected the suggestion someone in the back had tugged her arm, saying: \"It is clear there was one reason and one reason only for this collision, namely the grossly excessive speed you were travelling.\"\n\nThe court had heard how the defendant's car was doing at least 62mph in a 30mph zone before it crashed en route from Clapham to Ladbroke Grove early on 16 July 2022.\n\nMr Boutjettif and Ms Macharia were not wearing seatbelts in the back and had been filmed dancing just before the incident.\n\nThe defendant had gone with Mr Sidibe and Ms Macharia to pick up their friend, Mr Boutjettif, from a nightclub where he was working.\n\nTwo passengers were killed and a third injured\n\nMr Sidibe told police that Jamaican music had been playing and he had taken a video of the two other passengers \"twerking\" in the back.\n\nOkojie-Aidonoji told a witness at the scene: \"Don't call the police or ambulance.

Humza Yousaf has said the SNP could make life \"very difficult\" for Labour in a hung parliament.\n\nHumza Yousaf has said the SNP could make life \"very difficult\" for Labour in a hung parliament if it refused to give Scotland the power to call a referendum.\n\nScotland's first minister reiterated devolving this power would be the price for SNP support on Labour's agenda.\n\nHowever he said it was \"obvious\" that independence was not the \"consistent settled will of the Scottish people\".\n\nLabour have repeatedly said they would not do a referendum deal with the SNP.\n\nUK leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a snap general election following Boris Johnson's shock resignation as an MP.\n\nLast month senior figures in the SNP said they could hold the balance of power in the next parliament - the most explicit statement yet of their strategy ahead of the next general election.\n\nThey told the BBC they would make the demand for a referendum a central part of their general election campaign.\n\nSpeaking on BBC One's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Yousaf said having an independence referendum would be \"top of the list\" if Labour wanted SNP cooperation.\n\nHe said: \"We would never prop up a Conservative government, ever. And underline that and put that in bold. But of course if Labour do not want to cooperate with us then we would make life very difficult for them.\"\n\nAsked what he meant by this, Mr Yousaf pointed to budgets and the \"legislative process\".\n\n\"There were some tricky times when we were a minority government,\" he said. \"What you want is a government, particularly if you're coming in fresh as a new government, you want stability.\n\n\"You want to be able to get your budget through, you want to be able to get your legislative agenda through, you don't want frustrated at every single corner and every single turn.\"\n\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said Mr Yousaf's comments were an admission that he would \"usher in a Tory government\".\n\nShe said: \"That threat is a betrayal to the people of Scotland, who are dealing with soaring living costs and falling wages.\"\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Yousaf appeared confident he could \"hold a minority Labour government to ransom\" - and that Keir Starmer would \"cave to demands\" for an independence vote.\n\nMr Yousaf was sworn in as first minister in March after he defeated rivals Kate Forbes and Ash Regan in a leadership contest that exposed deep divisions within the party.\n\nThe 37-year-old became the first Muslim to lead a major UK party.\n\nHe was widely assumed to be Nicola Sturgeon's preferred successor, although she did not explicitly back any of the candidates in the contest.\n\nMs Sturgeon wanted to use the next general election in Scotland as a de facto referendum, though this would have no effect in law.\n\nBut in a rethink of strategy, Mr Yousaf has said he wanted to focus on making the case for independence because he knows pushing for a vote immediately will be rejected.\n\nIn opinion polls, support for Scottish independence consistently sits in the mid to high forties.\n\nHe said: \"We're there or thereabouts in relation to support for independence. I don't want to be there or thereabouts, I want to make sure that independence is a consistent settled will.\n\n\"So at the moment for example it's pretty obvious that independence is not the consistent settled will of the Scottish people.\"\n\nMr Yousaf later added that support for independence is \"still rock solid\".\n\nHe said: \"I've got no doubt at all, that I will be the leader that will ensure that Scotland becomes an independent nation.\"\n\nHumza Yousaf's interview comes as the SNP prepares for a special convention to discuss the way towards independence.\n\nHis comments will be looked at closely by both supporters and opponents.\n\nIn many respects, he merely restated his position.\n\nHis preferred option would be a referendum. He did not describe the next general election as a \"defacto referendum\" but believes each vote for the SNP demonstrates support for independence.\n\nHe hopes the right to hold a referendum could be extracted from Labour if it is the biggest party in a hung parliament.\n\nBut Labour is clear this will not happen: It believes any deal with the SNP could harm its recovery in England and fears it could drive away Scots who do not support another referendum.\n\nIt was, perhaps, surprising to hear Mr Yousaf explicitly say that independence is \"not the consistent settled will of the Scottish people\".\n\nThis may seem like a simple statement of fact given recent polling. But they are not words you would expect to hear from a first minister committed to independence as they could be seized on by opponents.\n\nOf course, Mr Yousaf wants that to change and wants support for independence to increase.\n\nHe also confirmed that there needs to be a consistent majority for independence before a referendum should be held.\n\nSo is the first minister making a distinction between wanting Holyrood to have the right to hold a referendum and actually holding one?\n\nClearly the consequences of losing a second referendum are something Mr Yousaf is well aware of and he may be playing the longer and more subtle game.

Temperatures can reach 50C in the daytime and there is very little rainfall.\n\nYet wildlife thrives in the harsh conditions, including hundreds of different birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\"It's a dry forest with an incredible biodiversity,\" said Gabriela Agostini.\n\nAmphibians are at high risk of extinction.

Spence dropped behind his jab in the second and found success, but it quickly emerged that Crawford was looking for huge counters.\n\nOne whipped centimetres past Spence's face, then Crawford found his mark moments later, dropping an advancing Spence with a counter one-two.\n\nSpence wobbled, but was back on his feet quickly and Crawford delivered a strong right on his opponent at the bell.\n\nThe speed and timing of Crawford sparked moments of panic from Spence, who tried to push ahead in the third and impose himself.\n\nBut Crawford was too quick for his rival, repeatedly tagging Spence with counters.\n\nHe was smacked with an uppercut in the fourth then ducked into several hooks from Crawford before eating a massive long left that sent blood flying from the Texan's nose.\n\nCrawford continued to pick Spence apart in the fifth, selecting his shots cleverly and punishing his opponent with combinations.\n\nSpence tried to fight fire with fire, but his timing was now completely skewed as Crawford began to push forward.\n\nAfter fighting so much of the bout brilliantly on the backfoot, Crawford was now pouring forward.\n\nSpence attempted to fend him off with his jab, but the Omaha native punched through his defences with his own, tagging him repeatedly with left hands and mixing in uppercuts at close range.\n\nAt the midway point Crawford could count himself at least five rounds ahead, including the 10-8 knockdown round.\n\nBut this dominance was not enough for the WBO champion. He let Spence come onto him early in the seventh before countering with a thunderous uppercut followed by a right hook that put his rival down for the second time.\n\nSpence was again quick off the canvas, but unsteady on his feet. Crawford sensed an end was close and stepped on the gas.\n\nSpence bounced off the ropes trying to avoid the onslaught, but flew straight into another right hook that sent him down again.\n\nThe bell rang to save Spence and a convincing argument could have been made to pull the battered champion out of the contest.\n\nNevertheless he emerged for the eighth hoping to land one punch that could turn the fight around - but Crawford's superiority was entrenched and he boxed beautifully off his jab, bamboozling Spence at will with his speed and movement.\n\nSpence's face was now battered, beginning to swell badly on the left side. His punches lacked power, while Crawford's jab snapped back the head of his opponent.\n\nThe ninth round saw the punishment finally end for Spence when Crawford invited him to fight fire with fire and the valiant champion did just that.\n\nBut while Crawford was calm, Spence was wild. Another right hook landed to stun Spence and as his opponent unleashed a flurry of punches, the referee stepped in to stop the contest.\n\nCrawford was elated in celebration, dancing with his family after checking on his fellow pound-for-pound great.\n\nCrawford said before the fight the winner could call himself the best fighter in the world in any weight division and few would surely find it difficult to disagree with 'Bud' after such a dominant performance.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTwo men who made the same trip in a tourist submersible that has now gone missing during a Titanic wreck dive have shared their fears over whether those stuck inside can escape.\n\nThe craft went missing in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday, prompting a major search and rescue operation.\n\nA journalist who travelled last year aboard the submersible said it would be impossible to escape without help.\n\nAnd it would be challenging for rescuers to find it in time, he said.\n\nCBS correspondent David Pogue - who took the trip last year and wrote an account of it - explained to the BBC that passengers were sealed inside the main capsule by several bolts that were applied from the outside and had to be removed by an external crew.\n\nHe told The Context programme that the craft, which is believed to be OceanGate's Titan submersible, had seven different functions to allow it to resurface and that it was \"really concerning\" none of these had so far worked.\n\nHowever, Mr Pogue said the vessel's resurfacing capabilities would be irrelevant if the sub became trapped or sprang a leak.\n\n\"There's no backup, there's no escape pod,\" he said. \"It's get to the surface or die.\"\n\nMike Reiss, a TV comedy writer who worked on The Simpsons and also took the trip last year, said he was \"not optimistic\"\n\n\"I know the logistics of it and I know how vast the ocean is and how very tiny this craft is,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"If it's down at the bottom I don't know how anyone is going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up,\" he added.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

How much is it going to cost me to charge it? Especially now the cost of electricity and everything is so high,\" she said.\n\n\"It's working out quite well. I'm probably spending around \u00a350 a month to charge it, while my previous car, to fill it up every week-and-a-half to two weeks, that would cost me about \u00a375 to \u00a380 to do that.\"\n\nAsked about the availability of charging points, she said: \"There's no doubt about that - there's a need.\n\n\"It is happening, but it's happening at a slower rate, so there needs to be a lot more investment from the government to ensure that the facilities are there for people when they are travelling.\n\n\"From north to south Wales, that's a journey I do in a motorhome, but I would really need to plan ahead if I drove down in my electric car because there would be a few stops on the way where I'd need to recharge.\n\n\"So yes, it's a lot of preparation, but it's part of the excitement, isn't it?\n\n\"I'm pleased with it. It's quiet, it's clean and I feel I'm doing my bit for the environment.\"\n\nOut of the 37,000 public charging devices across the UK, only 2,400 (6.4%) were in Wales, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) told the committee in January.\n\nContacted by the BBC to verify these figures, SMMT said they were approximate figures for the whole of 2022 based on Zap Map data at the time of the hearing.\n\nMembers of the committee also heard that despite a large growth in the number of chargers over the past few years, in Wales there is just one rapid charger per 15,000 people compared to one per 11,000 across the UK.\n\nElectric Vehicle Association (EVA) Cymru said that the lack of charging points represents the most significant barrier to the uptake of electric vehicles.\n\nIn terms of provision at home and work, EVA Cymru told the committee the Welsh government had also failed to review building regulations to ensure adequate parking spaces and charging points.\n\nThe report called on the Welsh government to complete a review as soon as possible and consider how hotels and visitor attractions could be encouraged to have charging points installed.\n\nCommittee chairman Mr Gruffydd said people would only switch to electric cars if they felt confident about being able to charge their cars when they needed to.\n\n\"Frustratingly, this is far from the case today,\" he said.\n\n\"There has been some progress over the last few years but nowhere near where it needs to be.\n\n\"The Welsh government's Action Plan isn't even 18 months old yet and some of the targets have already been missed. This is unacceptable - and embarrassing.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales, Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters said: \"We've got a plan and we are working through it. We've got limited resources and rather than just spraying charging points everywhere we are working out where are the best places to put our resource to best effect.\"\n\nMr Waters said he was \"not embarrassed\" by progress made so far and said he did not think people should be nervous about the lack of electric charging points.\n\n\"I have an electric car and as long as you plan it's fine,\" he said.\n\n\"You will not regret buying one and once you have bought one you won't go back.\"\n\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We welcome today's report which contains some key learnings for us as we work to deliver the charging infrastructure Wales needs.\n\n\"We were pleased to see that Wales is now showing the greatest percentage increase of any UK region in charging and rapid charging provision.\n\n\"This is thanks to an ambitious delivery programme we have developed with key partners and we now look forward to building on these foundations.\"", "The View, pictured left to right: Darren Rennie, Kieren Webster, Pete Reilly and Kyle Falconer\n\nA gig came to an abrupt halt after The View lead singer apparently threw a punch at the band's bassist.\n\nFans were left shocked when the disturbance broke out between Kyle Falconer and Kieren Webster at The Deaf Institute in Manchester.\n\nThe set ended with the musicians walking off stage after the clash was captured in footage shared on Twitter.\n\nFan Saffie Yates, who had waited six years to see the band, said she first thought it was some sort of stunt.\n\nShe said: \"It was very scary to see someone you respect behave like this.\n\n\"The bass player normally plays a couple of songs and it was his birthday yesterday.

The place is getting worse.\"\n\nThe message in February, which I received from a member of the maternity team, was stark but unsurprising. In a series of texts over the previous few months, the person had been getting increasingly concerned about what was happening at the East Kent trust.\n\nThe leadership is \"totally ineffective\" read one message. \"How long do we have to keep hearing this narrative - we accept bad things happened, we have learned and are putting it right. Nothing changes.\"\n\nFriday's report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is unfortunately just the latest marker in a near-decade of failure to improve maternity care at the trust. The revelation that inspectors considered closing the unit at the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford comes nine years after the trust's head of midwifery made a similar recommendation for the same reasons - that it was a danger to women and babies. The failure to act decisively then allowed many poor practices to continue.\n\nAn independent review published last October found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies may have survived with better care, while 12 other babies and 23 mothers wouldn't have suffered harm if they'd received good maternity care.\n\nPut simply, the trust has repeatedly failed to provide good care - and then failed to act when presented with evidence of poor care.\n\nConsider the extraordinary deaths of two new mothers from herpes at two of the trust's hospitals, just six weeks apart in 2018. The trust told the families there was no connection between the deaths. There were. A BBC investigation three years later found they'd been operated on by the same surgeon, and that the trust had failed to test him for herpes despite being told to do so.\n\nWhen those disclosures led to an inquest being ordered, the trust delayed its start for weeks by making last-minute legal arguments about wanting the coroner to put reporting restrictions on naming the surgeon, arguments it could have made months earlier, as it had been repeatedly discussed at previous hearings.\n\nWhen the inquest took evidence, a consultant microbiologist at the trust, Dr Sam Moses, was reprimanded for allegedly coaching a colleague in how to respond to answers while another clinician was sitting in the witness box.\n\nDr Moses also admitted that he hadn't told one family about the connections between the deaths, despite being in a meeting in which the mother of one of the women who had died asked explicitly about a link. He told the court that \"my role was to assist the trust. I didn't know whose responsibility it was to tell\" about the connection.\n\nAt the heart of the trust's problems, it seems, is a dysfunctional culture that stretches back almost a decade. In 2015, a review of its maternity services by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found multiple problems, including consultants failing to carry out ward rounds, assess women or attend out-of-hours calls. The report was dismissed as \"a load of rubbish\" by the trust. A Maternity Improvement Plan, overseen by NHS England, was devised. However, by the end of 2019 fewer than a quarter of its action points had been completed.\n\nImproving care is virtually impossible if colleagues don't get along. An Employment Tribunal decision, published in February, concluded that a \"toxic and difficult working environment\" existed at William Harvey Hospital's maternity unit where people were \"shouted and sworn at over differences of professional opinion\".\n\nOlukemi Akinmeji, a black midwife, sued the trust for race discrimination and victimisation after colleagues \"joked\" that they should \"check their bags\" on her last day at the hospital. Ms Akinmeji, who worked at the William Harvey between 2018 and 2020, won her case.\n\nThe tribunal judgement described hearing evidence of a broken working environment and a foul-mouthed registrar that one former colleague described as \"totally unprofessional\". Since Ms Akinmeji left the trust, that doctor has been promoted to consultant, after apparently being told to cut out the swearing.\n\nThree former staff have told the BBC there is a clique of senior midwives at the William Harvey, nicknamed by some as \"the untouchables\". They are described as \"watching each other's backs\", swearing, prone to talking disparagingly about both patients and colleagues. They've been working there for many years and are resistant to new working methods, and often, outsiders.\n\n\"It is the worst trust I've ever worked for,\" says one, \"there is so much unprofessional behaviour\". Another former staff member says,\"midwives often left the end of their shifts in tears, or broke down during a shift. People felt they couldn't speak up - even the managers had their favourites.\"\n\nIn that context, it's little wonder that the CQC found low morale and low levels of staff satisfaction, particularly among maternity staff at the William Harvey. Last year's staff survey, recently published, found that on all nine measures rated - including \"we are safe and healthy\" and \"we are always learning\" - the scores from all maternity staff were significantly lower than elsewhere in the trust. Bear in mind that the trust's overall scores included some of the lowest scores of any trust in England.\n\nIt's not as if East Kent has been left alone to sort its problems out. NHS England has been all over the trust for years, overseeing improvement plans and sending, as it announced in 2020, \"an expert team into the trust to ensure that improvements are made immediately\". Asked why their effort hadn't improved maternity care, NHS England couldn't provide an answer but said they had helped them recruit more nurses and midwives.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, the East Kent trust said it accepted it \"was not consistently providing the standards of maternity care women and families should expect.\" But it says that in the past few years, it has \"worked hard to improve services,\" including investing \"to increase the number of midwifes and doctors\" and to improve staff training.\n\nOn the final day of evidence in the inquest into the two deaths from herpes, in a different room in the same building, a pre-inquest review was taking place into the death of a 14-day-old boy in September 2022 at the William Harvey Hospital. Evidence heard at that hearing suggests that with better care, his death may have been avoided. The full inquest later this year will come to a final conclusion.\n\nThe baby's death, the CQC report and its actions at the herpes inquest show that East Kent's problem are deep-rooted and ongoing, and that multiple changes of various directors over many years have led to little discernible improvement.", "Former England bowler Tim Bresnan used a racial slur towards Azeem Rafiq's sister, a hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire has been told.\n\nRafiq claimed Bresnan used the term towards his sister Amna during a media day at Headingley in 2014.\n\nBresnan, who is not taking part in the process, denies the allegation.\n\nThe claim was part of the evidence heard on the first day of the Cricket Discipline Commission hearing into allegations of racism at Yorkshire.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also set out its cases against former England bowler Matthew Hoggard and ex-Yorkshire coach John Blain, who have both withdrawn from proceedings.\n\nThe ECB will state its cases against former Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale and ex-bowling coach Richard Pyrah, who will both not attend, on Thursday before moving on to former England captain Michael Vaughan, who is set to appear.\n\nRafiq briefly spoke to confirm witness statements regarding Hoggard, Bresnan and Blain but the panel said they had no need to ask him further questions. He is set to be called upon on Thursday.\n\u2022 None Yorkshire cricket racism hearing begins - all you need to know\n\nRafiq said former Yorkshire team-mates Bresnan and Gary Ballance used the phrase in reference to his sister's Pakistani heritage when they saw her at the media day while she was on work experience with the county.\n\nBallance has previously admitted using the word during his time at Yorkshire. He has admitted liability in response to his charge and will not participate.\n\nThe allegation formed part of the ECB's case against Bresnan, who has been charged with bringing the game into disrepute.\n\nThe ECB's lawyer Jane Mulcahy, speaking at the International Arbitration Centre in London, said Rafiq also alleged Bresnan used the racial slur towards or about Asian women he found attractive from about 2014 onwards.\n\nRafiq also claimed Bresnan, now 38, used the phrase to refer to an Asian woman who walked past them in a bar at a team hotel in Birmingham in July 2018.\n\nBresnan, who played 23 Tests and 85 one-day internationals for England and won two Ashes series, said he had never and would never use these terms.\n\nIn his initial response to the ECB and an interview with the governing body, Bresnan denied he had ever met Amna Rafiq. Later, he admitted he had seen her from afar when she was working at Leicester.\n\nBresnan, who withdrew from proceedings in February, also denied ever being alone in a bar with Rafiq.\n\nWhat are the other claims against Bresnan?\n\nThe two other parts of the charge against Bresnan concern allegations he used the terms \"the brothers\" and \"you lot\" in reference to Asian players at Yorkshire.\n\nRafiq alleged Bresnan would regularly refer to him and other Asian players including England spinner Adil Rashid as \"the brothers\".\n\nIt is also claimed Bresnan used the term towards Rafiq, Rashid, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan before a Twenty20 match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in June 2009.\n\nVaughan is accused of saying \"too many of you lot, we need to do something about it\" to those four Asian players before the same match, which he \"completely and categorically denies\".\n\nBresnan said he had no recollection of asking \"what are the brothers doing for dinner?\" and said he was unlikely to use that phrase. He said he did use the term \"brothers\" or \"brother\" but not in a racial context.\n\nShahzad said in his interview with the ECB that he did not hear Bresnan use racist terminology but he declined to provide a witness statement to the hearing.\n\nRafiq accused Bresnan of using the phrase \"you lot\" regularly, and specifically towards him and Rashid before a County Championship match against Derbyshire on 15 August 2012.\n\nBresnan admitted using the term regularly but denied it was in a racial context. He also said he had no recollection of the specific game against Derbyshire.\n\nBresnan is also accused of asking former Yorkshire player Moin Ashraf \"why do you lot pray before you bowl?\" during T20 Finals Day in August 2012. Bresnan said he asked because he was genuinely interested and denied using the phrase \"you lot\" as part of the question.\n\nThe ECB's case is that it is \"more likely than not\" Bresnan used these phrases in a racist or discriminatory manner, given Yorkshire have admitted a \"systemic\" use of such language during the relevant period, that Bresnan has admitted using the terms - albeit denying any racial connotation in their use - and that others involved in the case have admitted using such terms.\n\nThe ECB have to prove their cases to the civil standard - that on the \"balance of probabilities\" the alleged conduct did occur.\n\nIn the ECB's opening submissions, Mulcahy took the opportunity to \"correct a number of misrepresentations\" about the disciplinary process she claimed had been made by Bresnan, Blain, Pyrah and Hoggard to the media.\n\nPyrah and Bresnan both claimed they had never been interviewed during the ECB's investigation, but the ECB said it has evidence to the contrary in the form of interview transcripts.\n\nHoggard made a similar claim, but the ECB has evidence showing that after it initially wrote to him with the opportunity to provide written responses to the allegations made against him, he did so before informing the ECB he would not respond further, therefore denying himself the opportunity of an interview.\n\nMulcahy also questioned Hoggard's claim he was not invited to participate in the investigation into Rafiq's claims by law firm Squire Patton Bogg (SPB), which upheld seven of the 43 allegations.\n\nShe said emails from former acting chief executive Paul Hudson to Hoggard included attached emails from the investigation team to Hoggard, who denies receiving those messages. Hudson also reported the investigation team left a voicemail for Hoggard in March 2021.\n\nFormer England bowler Hoggard was charged by the ECB following allegations he used racial slurs as well as referring to Rafiq and other Asian players in the Yorkshire squad as \"you lot\".\n\nHe admitted to using the first racist term alleged and while he does not remember specifically using the second, he denied any racist or discriminatory intent. He also denied referring to Asian players or any other ethnic group as \"you lot\".\n\nIt is also alleged Ashes winner Hoggard used the term \"token black man\" or \"TBM\" towards Ismail Dawood in 2004 and/or 2005 in the dressing room and in public.\n\nHoggard claims ex-wicketkeeper and umpire Dawood gave himself the nickname on Hoggard's stag do in Dublin.\n\nDawood told BBC Sport in February this was \"another feeble attempt to malign and ridicule\" and was \"simply not true\", and in his witness statement said Hoggard had used the phrase throughout the 2004 season.\n\nWhat is Blain charged with?\n\nThe ECB charged Blain with using a racist phrase to describe Asian individuals during pre-season training at Headingley in 2010, as well as on other occasions at Yorkshire during that year and 2011. Blain denies the allegation.\n\nRafiq alleges that on one occasion Blain used the term, he was pulled up for it by a team-mate and responded that it was \"like calling a British person 'a Brit'\".\n\nIn his witness statement, former Scotland bowler Majid Haq said then team-mate Blain used the term in Nairobi in January 2007. Blain said in response that it was like calling Australians 'Aussies' and New Zealanders 'Kiwis'. Haq is set to give evidence on Friday.\n\nBlain denies both incidents took place and, in the case of the latter, alleged witnesses deny any recollection of the conversation.\n\nIn laying out its case, the ECB noted the \"striking\" similarities of Blain's defence during the alleged incidents. It also said it was \"notable\" that Blain and Ballance overlapped in their time at Yorkshire.\n\nIn the cases against Blain, Hoggard and Bresnan, Mulcahy said the panel could draw an \"adverse inference\" from their non-participation in the disciplinary proceedings.\n\nWhat is happening in the hearing?\n\nIt has been more than two-and-a-half years since former Yorkshire spinner Rafiq first made claims of racism at the county, later calling English cricket \"institutionally racist\".\n\nThe hearing concludes on 9 March and the opening four days of proceedings are being held in public. The rest will be conducted in private.\n\nA three-person panel will hear disciplinary proceedings brought against Yorkshire and seven individuals who were all charged by the ECB with bringing the game into disrepute.\n\nThe panel comprises Cricket Discipline Commission chair, lawyer and former Derbyshire batsman Tim O'Gorman, Mark Milliken-Smith KC - a lawyer with specialist knowledge of sports law - and Dr Seema Patel, a senior law lecturer at Nottingham Trent University.\n\nYorkshire will also not attend after the club pleaded guilty to four ECB amended charges, which were detailed on Wednesday.\n\nThe county were accused of having \"mishandled\" the SPB investigation into Rafiq's initial claims of racism and charged with deleting relevant emails and/or documents held electronically, which the club last week confirmed had happened.\n\nThe ECB stated Yorkshire \"failed to take adequate action\" on complaints of racist abuse against crowd members from fellow spectators during a match at Headingley in 2017 and at Scarborough in 2018.\n\nYorkshire were also accused of failing to address the \"systemic use of racist or discriminatory language over a long period\" by employees or players at the club.\n\u2022 None Was it a mistake to sell off British Gas?

Liverpool and beyond.\n\n\"This new drug could mean that injections into the back of the eye may not be necessary for patients suffering with this condition, instead replacing this with a tablet-based treatment which is a much more comfortable treatment for patients.\"\n\nMr Gotts said: \"I am proud to be the first patient in the world to try this treatment, which will hopefully not only help save

Pyongyang is developing tactical nuclear weapons that can target South Korea, and refining its long-range weapons that can reach the US mainland.\n\nThe US already has a treaty obligation to defend South Korea, and has previously pledged to use nuclear weapons if necessary. But some in South Korea have started to doubt that commitment and call for the country to pursue its own nuclear programme.\n\nThe South Korean President, Yoon Suk-yeol, who was at the White House for a state visit, said the Washington Declaration marked an \"unprecedented\" commitment by the US to enhance defence, deter attacks and protect US allies by using nuclear weapons.\n\nChina - clearly not pleased with the US stance - warned against \"deliberately stirring up tensions, provoking confrontation and playing up threats\".\n\nThe new agreement is a result of negotiations that took place over the course of several months, according to a senior administration official.\n\nUnder the new deal, the US will make its defence commitments more visible by sending a nuclear-armed submarine to South Korea for the first time in 40 years, along with other strategic assets, including nuclear-capable bombers.\n\nThe two sides will also develop a Nuclear Consultative Group to discuss nuclear planning issues.\n\nPoliticians in Seoul have long been pushing Washington to involve them more in planning for how and when to use nuclear weapons against North Korea.\n\nAs North Korea's nuclear arsenal has grown in size and sophistication, South Koreans have grown wary of being kept in the dark over what would trigger Mr Biden to push the nuclear button on their behalf.\n\nA fear that Washington might abandon Seoul has led to calls for South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons.\n\nBut in January, Mr Yoon alarmed policymakers in Washington when he became the first South Korean president to put this idea back on the table in decades.\n\nIt suddenly became clear to the US that reassuring words and gestures would no longer work and if it was to dissuade South Korea from wanting to build its own bombs, it would have to offer something concrete.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Yoon had made it clear that he expected to return home having made \"tangible\" progress.\n\nDuyeon Kim, from the Centre for a New American Security, said it was a \"big win\" for South Korea to be involved in nuclear planning.\n\n\"Until now, tabletop exercises would end before Washington's decision to use nuclear weapons,\" said Ms Kim.\n\n\"The US had considered such information to be too classified to share, but it is important to practice and train for this scenario given the types of nuclear weapons North Korea is producing.\"\n\nThis new Nuclear Consultative Group ticks the box, providing the increased involvement the South Korean government has been asking for. But the bigger question is whether it will quell the public's anxieties.\n\nIt does not ink a total commitment from the US that it would use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea if North Korea were to attack.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday Mr Biden said: \"A nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies and partners is unacceptable and will result in the end of whatever regime were to take such an action.\"\n\nIn return, the US has demanded that South Korea remain a non-nuclear state and a faithful advocate of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The US sees dissuading South Korea from going nuclear as essential, fearful that if it fails, other countries may follow in its footsteps.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: During the visit, Mr Yoon treated Mr Biden to a rendition of American Pie\n\nBut these US commitments are unlikely to fully satisfy the influential, and increasingly vocal, group of academics, scientists and members of South Korea's ruling party who have been pushing for Seoul to arm itself.\n\nDr Cheong Seong-chang, a leading proponent of South Korea going nuclear, said that while the declaration had many positive aspects, it was \"extremely regrettable that South Korea had openly given up its right to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]\", adding that this had \"further strengthened our nuclear shackles\".\n\nPresident Biden said the US was continuing efforts to get North Korea back to the negotiating table. Washington says Pyongyang has ignored numerous requests to talk without preconditions.\n\nThe US hopes to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, but last year the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared the country's nuclear status \"irreversible\".\n\nSome experts say it now makes more sense to discuss arms control rather than denuclearisation.", "Footage released by West Yorkshire Police shows the moment two men try to get rid of their mobile phones on the roof of a cannabis farm.\n\nThe men were arrested and charged with possession of a class B drug after police found the large farm in the building.", "The Myanmar army killed thousands of Rohingyas and drove hundreds of thousands of them into neighbouring Bangladesh\n\nNearly seven years after the Myanmar military killed thousands of Muslim Rohingyas, in what the UN called \"textbook ethnic cleansing\", it wants their help.\n\nFrom interviews with Rohingyas living in Rakhine State the BBC has learned of at least 100 of them being conscripted in recent weeks to fight for the embattled junta. All their names have been changed to protect them.\n\n\"I was frightened, but I had to go,\" says Mohammed, a 31-year-old Rohingya man with three young children. He lives near the capital of Rakhine, Sittwe, in the Baw Du Pha camp. At least 150,000 internally displaced Rohingyas have been forced to live in IDP camps for the past decade.\n\nIn the middle of February the camp leader came to him late at night, Mohammed said, and told him he would have to do military training. \"These are army orders,\" he remembers him saying. \"If you refuse they have threatened to harm your family.\"\n\nThe BBC has spoken to several Rohingyas who have confirmed that army officers have been going around the camps and ordering the younger men to report for military training.\n\nThe terrible irony for men like Mohammed is that Rohingyas in Myanmar are still denied citizenship, and subjected to a range of discriminatory restrictions - like a ban on travel outside their communities.\n\nIn 2012 tens of thousands of Rohingyas were driven out of mixed communities in Rakhine State, and forced to live in squalid camps. Five years later, in August 2017, 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, after the army launched a brutal clearance operation against them, killing and raping thousands and burning their villages. Some 600,000 of them still remain there.\n\nMany Rohingyas have been forced to live in camps for the displaced for the last decade\n\nMyanmar is now facing a genocide trial at the International Court of Justice in the Hague over its treatment of the Rohingyas.\n\nThat the same army is now forcibly recruiting them is a telling sign of its desperation, after losing huge swathes of territory in Rakhine recently to an ethnic insurgent group called the Arakan Army. Dozens of Rohingyas in Rakhine have been killed by military artillery and aerial bombardments.\n\nThe military has also suffered significant losses to opposition forces in other parts of the country. Large numbers of soldiers have been killed, wounded, surrendered or defected to the opposition, and finding replacements is difficult. Few want to risk their lives propping up an unpopular regime.\n\nAnd the Rohingyas fear that is the reason they are being targeted again - to be cannon fodder in a war the junta seems to be losing.\n\nMohammed said he was driven to the base of the 270th Light Infantry Battalion in Sittwe. Rohingyas have been prohibited from living in the town since they were driven out during the 2012 communal violence.\n\n\"We were taught how to load bullets and shoot,\" he said. \"They also showed us how to disassemble and reassemble a gun.\"\n\nIn a video seen by the BBC another group of Rohingya conscripts can be seen being taught how to use BA 63 rifles, an older standard weapon used by the Myanmar armed forces.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMohammed was trained for two weeks, then sent home. But after just two days he was called back, and put on a boat with 250 other soldiers and transported five hours up-river to Rathedaung, where a fierce battle with the Arakan Army was under way for control of three hilltop military bases.\n\n\"I had no idea why I was fighting. When they told me to shoot at a Rakhine village, I would shoot.\"\n\nHe fought there for 11 days. They were desperately short of food, after a shell fell on their supply hut. He saw several Rohingya conscripts killed by artillery and he was injured by shrapnel in both legs, and taken back to Sittwe for treatment.\n\nOn 20 March the Arakan Army released photos from the battle, after it had taken control of the three bases, showing several corpses, at least three of them identified as Rohingyas.\n\n\"While I was in the middle of the battle I was terrified the whole time. I kept thinking about my family,\" Mohammed said. \"I never thought I would have to go to war like that. I just wanted to go home. When I got home from the hospital I hugged my mother and cried. It felt like being born again from my mother's womb.\"\n\nAnother conscript was Hussain, from Ohn Taw Gyi camp, which is also near Sittwe. His brother Mahmoud says he was taken away in February and completed his military training, but he went into hiding before they could send him to the front line.\n\nThe military denies using Rohingyas to fight its battles with the Arakan Army. General Zaw Min Tun, the junta spokesman, told the BBC that there was no plan to send them to the front line. \"We want to ensure their safety, so we have asked them to help with their own defence,\" he said.\n\nThe devastating civil war between the army and ethnic insurgent groups has raged for three years\n\nBut in interviews with the BBC, seven Rohingyas in five different IDP camps near Sittwe all said the same thing: that they know of at least 100 Rohingyas who have been recruited this year and sent off to fight.\n\nThey said teams of soldiers and local government officials came to the camps in February to announce that the younger men would be conscripted, at first telling people they would get food, wages and citizenship if they joined up. These were powerful lures.\n\nFood in the IDP camps has become scarce and expensive as the escalating conflict with the Arakan Army has cut off the international aid supplies. And the denial of citizenship is at the heart of the Rohingyas' long struggle for acceptance in Myanmar, and one reason they suffer systematic discrimination, described by human rights groups as similar to apartheid.\n\nHowever, when the soldiers returned to take the conscripted men away, they retracted the offer of citizenship. When asked by the camp residents why they, as non-citizens, should be subjected to conscription, they were told that they had a duty to defend the place where they lived. They would be militiamen, not soldiers, they were told. When they asked about the offer of citizenship, the answer was \"you misunderstood\".\n\nNow, according to one camp committee member, the army is demanding new lists of potential recruits. After seeing and hearing from the first group to come back from the front line, he said, no-one else was willing to risk being conscripted.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nSo the camp leaders are now trying to persuade the poorest men, and those with no jobs, to go, by offering to support their families while they are away, with donations raised from other camp residents.\n\n\"This conscription campaign is unlawful and more akin to forced labour,\" said Matthew Smith, from the human rights group Fortify Rights.\n\n\"There's a brutal and perverse utility to what's happening. The military is conscripting the victims of the Rohingya genocide in an attempt to fend off a nationwide democratic revolution. This regime has no regard for human life. It's now layering these abuses on top of its long history of atrocities and impunity.\"\n\nBy using Rohingyas in its battles against the advancing Arakan Army, the Myanmar military threatens to reignite communal conflict with the ethnic Rakhine Buddhist population, much of which supports the insurgents.\n\nIt was friction between the two communities which in 2012 caused the expulsion of tens of thousands of Rohingyas from towns like Sittwe. In 2017, ethnic Rakhine men joined in the army's attacks on the Rohingyas.\n\nTension between the two communities has eased since then.\n\nThe Arakan Army is fighting for an autonomous state, part of a wider campaign with other ethnic armies and opposition groups to overthrow the military junta and create a new, federal system in Myanmar.\n\nRohingyas in Rakhine State now find themselves caught in the middle - between the junta and the insurgents\n\nNow on the brink of victory in Rakhine State, the Arakan Army has talked about giving citizenship to all who have lived there recently, implying that it might accept the return of the Rohingya population from Bangladesh.\n\nThe mood has now changed. A spokesman for the Arakan Army, Khaing Thukha, told the BBC that they viewed Rohingyas being conscripted to fight for the junta as \"the worst betrayal of those who had recently been victims of genocide, and of those fighting for liberation from dictatorship\".\n\nPro-military media have also been giving publicity to what appear to have been Rohingya protests in Buthidaung against the Arakan Army, although local people told the BBC they suspected these were organised by the army in an attempt to divide the two groups.\n\nThe Rohingyas are now forced to fight for an army that does not recognise their right to live in Myanmar, thereby alienating the ethnic insurgents who may soon control most of Rakhine. Once targeted by both, they are now caught between the two sides.\n\nMohammed has been given a certificate by the army, stating that he has fought in battle on their side. He has no idea what value it has, nor whether it exempts him from further military service. It could well get him into trouble with the Arakan Army if it continues its advance towards Sittwe and his camp.\n\nHe is still recovering from his injuries, and says he is unable to sleep at night after his experience.\n\n\"I'm afraid they will call me again. This time I came back because I was lucky, but next time I am not sure what will happen.\"", "Last updated on .From the section Golf\n\n-12-8 -7 P Reed (US), J Spieth (US), R Henley (US)\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm kept his nerve and patience to win a first Masters, swinging an exciting final day in his favour from American Brooks Koepka.\n\nRahm, 28, carded a three-under 69 to finish on 12 under and win by four shots as Koepka, who led by two going into the final round, signed for a 75.\n\nKoepka ended joint second with veteran Phil Mickelson, who shot a a stunning seven-under 65 to finish eight under.\n\nFormer champions Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed were a shot further back.\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler finished in a group on four under, along with England's US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who was the highest finisher from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nRahm became the fourth Spanish player to win the Masters and his victory poignantly came on what would have been the 66th birthday of the legendary two-time champion Seve Ballesteros, who won in 1980 and 1983.\n\n\"I wasn't sure how [the emotion] was going to come to me until I hit the third shot on the 18th,\" said Rahm, whose first major win came at the 2021 US Open.\n\n\"History of the game is a big reason why I play and Seve is a big part of that history.\n\n\"For me to get it done on the 40th anniversary of his second Masters win and on his birthday was incredibly meaningful.\"\n\nHow Rahm took control to win Green Jacket\n\nRahm was one of the pre-tournament favourites - alongside Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who missed the halfway cut, and world number one Scheffler - after an impressive year in the lead-up to the first men's major of the season.\n\nWith three wins on the PGA Tour this year, plus four top-10 finishes in six previous Masters starts, Rahm had the form and previous pedigree to win at Augusta - and he duly delivered.\n\nRemarkably, he started his bid on Thursday with a double bogey after a four-putt on the first hole. After that he barely made a wrong move.\n\nRahm showed all facets of his outstanding all-round game - particularly his relentlessly huge driving and nerveless putting - to record an opening round of 65 and then posting scores of 69, 73 and 69.\n\nNot only did Rahm win the iconic Green Jacket for the first time, he also returned to the world number one ranking.\n\nLeading by four shots with four holes left to play, he maintained that advantage going into the 18th hole and could even afford to hit his final drive into the trees.\n\nThe ball ended up bouncing back into play and landing 150 yards from the tee, but he retained composure to lay up and knock a sublime chip to within a few feet for an unorthodox par.\n\n\"It was a very unusual par, very much a Seve par - it was in a non purposeful way, a testament to him. I know he was pulling for me and it was a great Sunday,\" added the 28-year-old.\n\n\"This one is for Seve. I knew he would be up there helping and help he did.\"\n\nAfter sinking his final putt, Rahm shook his clenched fists while looking up to the sky.\n\nHis family - wife Kelley, along with two sons Kepa and Eneko - quickly joined him on the 18th green before he was congratulated further by friends and family.\n\nThose included compatriot Jose Maria Olazabal, another two-time Masters champion and one of Rahm's mentors.\n\nWhat looked set to be a tight two-way duel between Rahm and Koepka ended up being a controlled and clinical victory for the Spaniard.\n\nAs well as Rahm's brilliance, a poor final round from Koepka was a significant factor.\n\nKoepka was bidding for a fifth major title - and a first since 2019 - despite barely having played 72-hole events in recent months after deciding to switch to the controversial Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour.\n\nThe LIV tournaments are played over 54 holes, although Koepka arrived at the Masters in form having won last week's event in Miami where his $4m (\u00a33.2m) prize, exceeded the record $3.24m Rahm will take home for winning the first major of the year.\n\nBut his driving became wayward early in the final round and once that allowed the momentum to shift towards Rahm, Koepka could not recover.\n\nAsked by Sky Sports how he felt after being unable to maintain his lead, Koepka said: \"Kind of ho-hum. I didn't play that great. I hit some good shots and just ended up in some terrible spots. Then at the end trying to make birdies when he's ahead - it's tough.\n\n\"Second is not very fun so that's motivation in itself.\"\n\nIn front of the final pair, a dramatic battle began to build as a host of former major champions jostled for position and threated to take advantage of any slip-ups.\n\nThree-time Masters winner Mickelson, 52, surprisingly became the main challenger after a scorching run of five birdies in the final seven holes.\n\nMickelson skipped last year's tournament because of a self-imposed break from the sport, after he made controversial comments about the Saudi-backed LIV project which he eventually joined.\n\nBut he looked like his old self as he took the acclaim of the Augusta patrons after the final birdie moved him into the clubhouse lead.\n\nIt also lifted him into joint second place alongside fellow LIV player Koepka, remaining there to become the oldest player in Masters history to finish in the top five.\n\n\"This is as much fun as I could possibly have playing golf,\" he said.\n\n\"The final round of the Masters and to play the way I did and finish with a couple of birdies, regardless of the outcome, it has been a fun day.\n\n\"I'm grateful to be here and compete, to be part of this great championship and to play how I did was extra special.\"\n\nMickelson finished a shot ahead of playing partner Spieth, with the 2015 champion also racing up the leaderboard after starting with two birdies and adding three on the bounce around the turn.\n\nReed, the 2018 champion and another to move to LIV, had a double-bogey seven on the second hole but responded with eight birdies on his way to a 68 as he joined Spieth on seven under, in a share of fourth place with another American, Russell Henley.\n\u2022 None Enter the world of the social media personality\u2019s multi-level marketing scheme and webcam business\n\u2022 None The rise and fall of the jeweller-turned-criminal: Listen to Gangster: The Story of John Palmer", "Several Nato members, including the US, are thought to be lobbying for current chief Jens Stoltenberg to stay on\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace has said he is out of the race to become the next Nato chief.\n\nAsked about leading the alliance from the end of September, when Jens Stoltenberg's term ends, he told The Economist: \"It's not going to happen.\"\n\nSeveral Nato members, including the US, are thought to have been lobbying Mr Stoltenberg to stay on.\n\nBut on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said his country was not \"promoting any particular candidate\".\n\nNato - the West's defensive military alliance - has 31 members who agree to help one another if they come under attack.\n\nSpeaking to German media about the top job last month, Mr Wallace said: \"I've always said it would be a good job. That's a job I'd like. But I'm also loving the job I do now.\"\n\nDespite his obvious enthusiasm to succeed Mr Stoltenberg as the next head of Nato, he appears to have failed to get the backing of key allies.\n\nUS President Joe Biden described Mr Wallace as \"very qualified\" for the job when he met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Washington recently.\n\nBut in private, the US is believed to be one of the nations trying to persuade Mr Stoltenberg to stay - at least for another year. This was echoed by Mr Wallace in comments to The Economist.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has re-focused diplomatic attention on Nato's role in the 21st Century and whether it can deter Russian aggression.\n\nMr Wallace proved popular with a number of countries on the alliance's eastern flank because of his leadership in supplying weapons to Ukraine.\n\nBut others have argued for continuity in a time of war, or that the job should be reserved for a former head of government.\n\nMr Stoltenberg, who has been the alliance's top boss for nine years, has neither confirmed or denied his intentions to continue in the job.\n\nHe told reporters last week: \"I am responsible for all decisions that this alliance has to take except for one. And that is about my future. That is for the 31 allies to decide.\"\n\nAnother contender for the role is Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who - if elected - would be the first female Nato chief.\n\nIn his interview with The Economist, Mr Wallace said whoever takes on the role would need to deal with \"a lot of unresolved issues in Nato,\" including differing demands from US and French leadership.\n\nFrance believes Nato's secretary general should come from within the European Union.\n\nWith less than a month to go until the Nato summit in Lithuania, it looks increasingly likely that Mr Stoltenberg will be asked to extend his tenure again.\n\nNato was formed in 1949 by 12 countries and its original goal was to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War Two.\n\nMore recently, Russia has used the expansion of Nato as a pretext for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv is not a member, but has received support from alliance members.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was disappointed his country had not been invited to join Nato at next month's summit in Vilnius, adding that Ukraine would be the strongest member of Nato's eastern flank.\n\nSign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Ivan Holtvenko holds his old Azovstal ID card as he talks\n\nOne year after the Ukrainian city of Mariupol fell to Russian control, its displaced steel workers find themselves both comforted and unsettled by ghosts of their former lives.\n\nIvan Holtvenko clutches his ID card from his old job in the southern port city as he chats to me in his new workplace, a steelworks in central Ukraine.\n\n\"I hid the pass [when I fled], and now I'm saving it, hoping that one day I'll need it again,\" he says.\n\nIvan is among dozens of workers from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks who have begun a new life in Kamianske, 270km [168 miles] away, after surviving the final battle for Mariupol, one of the most defining moments of the war.\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the tunnels and bunkers of the steelworks, making a last stand against the Russian forces. They were eventually forced to leave, but Azovstal became a symbol of resistance against the invasion.\n\nAzovstal - with its maze of underground tunnels - was attacked for weeks in early 2022\n\nIvan has no idea if, or when, Ukraine will retake Mariupol. But he yearns for his old life.\n\nWhen former Azovstal workers bump into each other in the shelters, hallways, offices and factory floor of their new workplace, they connect over their lost lives. Some have nicknamed themselves the \"Mariupol diaspora\".\n\n\"When you meet someone from Mariupol you get that feeling inside,\" repairs engineer Oleksandr Shabanov says, smiling.\n\nManagers at the new steel factory say there are about 120 former Azovstal staff there, as well as more from another Mariupol plant.\n\nWorkers reminisce about summers spent at the beach, fishing trips and the sea views in their industrial home city. Two say they were in the process of building holiday homes together when Russia invaded.\n\nThey talk of Facebook groups that have now gone quiet. Some of their former colleagues have moved to other parts of Ukraine or abroad. Others have been killed. Many more are missing.\n\n\"We don't know what's happened to him,\" a group of Mariupol workers say as they talk about one former colleague and friend.\n\nOf the 10,500 staff at Azovstal, managers say fewer than half are accounted for.\n\nThe Mariupol workers remember a time when they weren't scared of war, joking that people there have a reputation for being tough.\n\nFighting first broke out in the city in 2014, and the government briefly lost control after clashes with pro-Russian militants and protesters. But the workers say they never thought it would fall, as it did last year following a lengthy siege.\n\nMariupol was in a strategic location for the Russian invasion, linking as it does Crimea and Donbas, and the brutal battle for its control lasted more than 80 days.\n\nIts theatre, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, was bombed, its maternity hospital badly damaged in a Russian strike.\n\nIvan said nothing had prepared them for this.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be a crisis we could live through, just as we did in 2014,\" he tells me.\n\nAs is the case with other members of the Mariupol diaspora, Ivan's home was destroyed during the siege. The building and everything inside it is now just a memory - family photos, clothes, furniture.\n\n\"Everything got burnt,\" he says.\n\nBut while Ivan and other colleagues draw strength from their community, for others it only exacerbates their trauma.\n\n\"How can anything comfort me?\" says engineer Ihor Khadzhava.\n\n\"There is nothing good about ending up here\u2026 and nowhere to go back to. There's no plant, no work, nowhere to live, just hate.\"\n\nResidents who have remained in Mariupol say Moscow has brought in labourers from across Russia and Central Asia to rebuild the city, but not as it was - streets have had their Soviet names restored, new buildings have appeared and many of those damaged in the siege have gone. Russian flags have been erected as well as pro-Russia billboards and posters.\n\nThe Russian rouble is now the only currency accepted in shops there, and re-opened schools in the city are teaching a Russian-language curriculum. Residents are under pressure to get Russian passports.\n\nIhor is now resigned to accepting whatever fate might bring. When sirens ring out at the factory to warn of a possible Russian attack, he keeps working.\n\nHe hasn't used a shelter since the two months he spent underground in the bunker at Azovstal last year.\n\nIhor Khadzhava and his daughter in the Azovstal shelter\n\n\"What's the use?\" the 39-year-old says blankly.\n\nFor the former Azovstal workers who do use the shelters, there are memories even underground.\n\nOleksandr takes a photo on his phone and sends it to his wife Yuliia.\n\n\"No kidding. It really looks the same,\" she replies.\n\nBeing in the near-identical bunker can be traumatic, Oleksandr says.\n\n\"The point of the shelter is not to feel frightened. When you go down it's the safest place\u2026 but in the back of my mind there is this fear,\" he says.\n\nIn Mariupol, an estimated 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed during the siege by the Russian forces, and about 350,000 of the population of almost half a million were forced to leave.\n\nBack then, Oleksandr and Yuliia had sought shelter in Azovstal's Soviet-era bunkers after fleeing their ninth-floor apartment - a shell had hit a neighbouring building, spraying shrapnel through their window.\n\nThe couple grabbed food, clothing, identification documents, their cat Mason and a 2kg bag of pet food, before running to Azovstal as shells landed around them.\n\nIn the shelter, they slept on wooden pallets and divided up tasks to stay busy - guarding the exits, cooking meals, cleaning.\n\nWhen supplies were running low, Yuliia would draw the children pictures of their favourite foods so they could pretend to eat them. They dreamed of burgers and sausages.\n\nOleksandr and Yuliia remember Ihor's daughter making a \"squeaky noise like a siren\" when she came to stroke Mason, while another child, whose own pets had been left at home, sang to him each night: \"Mason, Mason, you're a king of cats\".\n\nThere were other pets in the shelter - a pug would sometimes run around frantically as missiles landed overhead.\n\nThe shelter's occupants had no idea how long they would be there. Sometimes they wondered if they would ever see daylight again.\n\nKamianske is in a much safer location than Mariupol - further inland and on the west side of the Dnipro River, which acts as a natural buffer.\n\nBut workers say that Russia's siege of Mariupol, and the important role the Azovstal bunker played in keeping some of them safe, has taught them the importance of being prepared.\n\nIn the shelter at the Kamianske steelworks, Oleksandr, Ivan and others wait behind thick metal doors to be given the all-clear to resurface. Smaller side rooms contain toilets, an examination bed and medical equipment, stacks of water bottles, jars and tins of food, phones and computers, and a generator.\n\n\"We understand that it's not only about sheltering, but also about having things that are most needed in those situations,\" Ivan explains.\n\n\"Is there a place to sit? What if there are wounded in the group? Is everything OK with the electricity? What about internet connection? Warm clothes?

The vicious attack in Mpondwe left about 40 people dead.\n\nIslamic State-linked militants have been blamed for the attack.\n\nThe Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was created in the 1990s and took up arms against President Yoweri Museveni, alleging persecution of Muslims.\n\nThey are now largely based in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Mpondwe Lhubiriha Secondary School attacked on Friday is close to the border.\n\nMs Masika says she and other residents have been left terrified by the attack which lasted about 90 minutes.\n\n\"I have been unable to eat or sleep since then,\" she told the BBC in Swahili.\n\nThe students usually sing before bedtime - and at first she and her daughter thought the noise that interrupted their songs at around 22:00 (20:00 GMT) suggested that they were having a bit of fun.\n\nBut it soon became clear that something horrific was under way at the school, which had around 60 boarders living in a small compound.\n\nADF rebels had entered dormitories, setting fire to them and using machetes to kill and maim students.\n\nOne family in Mpondwe held the funerals on Sunday for a father and son killed in the attack - 47-year-old security guard Elphanas Mbusa and 17-year-old Masereka Elton.\n\nHurubana Kimadi Onesmus lost his son, a school watchman, and at least one of his grandsons - it is not clear if the other has been kidnapped\n\nTheir other son, 15-year-old Brian Muhindo who was also attending the school, is missing. They do not know if he is among the six boys kidnapped or one of those whose bodies cannot be identified because they have been so badly burned.\n\nHurubana Kimadi Onesmus told the BBC he found it difficult to understand how the attackers were able to infiltrate the school where his son, the security guard, worked and where his grandsons were studying.\n\n\"There is a very heavy military presence in the area,\" the 69-year-old said.\n\nThe BBC team were given a few minutes to photograph the scene at school in Mpondwe\n\nNow there is a lot of security at the school - and the BBC team was given only a few minutes to take some photos of the burnt buildings.\n\nIt was a devastating and upsetting scene.\n\nLots of dried blood is still on the ground outside the girls' dormitory - they had been attacked with machetes and others shot dead as they ran away.\n\nThe boys' dormitory had been locked - they had either refused to open it to the rebels or they were locked inside by them. The militants poured fuel on the building and set it alight.\n\nInside, the smell of death is unmistakeable - beds have been reduced to wire mesh with pieces of flesh still stuck to them.\n\nIt is not clear if the doors of the boys' dormitory was locked by those inside or the rebels\n\nMs Masika said towards the end of the attack, at around 23:30, she heard one of the assailants talking at her gate and asking a fellow fighter if \"the job was done\".\n\nThey were talking in Swahili - the lingua franca in the region - and afterwards began shouting \"Allahu Akbar\", meaning \"God is greatest\".\n\nShe said after these chants one of them added: \"We have succeeded in destabilising Museveni's country.\"\n\nSeveral funerals were held on Sunday for those killed in the attack\n\nIn response, President Museveni vowed to send more troops to Rwenzori Mountains, which are along the border between Uganda and the DR Congo, saying: \"Their action... the desperate, cowardly, terrorist action... will not save them.\"\n\nThe area around Mpondwe seems to be a mix of Christians and Muslims. Some of those attending the funerals on Sunday were dressed in traditional Muslim attire.\n\nOther funerals for the pupils killed in the attack were held in villages across the region, with most people dumbfounded and pained by the brutality of the assault.", "Tim Westwood has been interviewed under caution over five alleged sexual offences\n\nA review of what the BBC knew about allegations regarding DJ Tim Westwood's conduct has received a \"significant amount of important new information\".\n\nWestwood was interviewed under caution over five alleged sexual offences by the Metropolitan Police earlier this year. He denies the allegations.\n\nThe alleged incidents are said to have occurred between 1982 and 2016.\n\nA dedicated phone line set up to help people contribute evidence to the review will close on Friday.\n\nBarrister Gemma White, who is leading the review, said it was set up to \"expand the ways people can come forward\" and report information.\n\nShe was appointed by the BBC Board last August after an internal review found that the corporation should have paid more attention to a string of sexual assault allegations that had been made against the former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ.\n\nThe inquiry, which has already seen more than 50,000 BBC documents, is expected to publish its findings in the summer.\n\nWhite thanked everyone who had used the phone line and said: \"We know that taking the decision to call was not easy for many of you and that speaking to us has taken courage.\n\n\"Your evidence will assist me in my task of independently establishing whether the BBC knew of concerns and responded appropriately to them.\n\n\"If you have been thinking of contributing but have not been sure about whether to do so, please do get in touch now.\"\n\nWestwood, 65, stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra in April last year and strongly denies the allegations.\n\nLast year, a statement from a representative of Westwood said: \"Tim Westwood strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\n\"In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially.", "Saffie-Rose Roussos was a \"beautiful, sensitive soul with an amazing magnetic personality\", her mother Lisa said.\n\nShe was at the arena with eight-year-old Saffie and was injured in the attack, as was Saffie\u2019s elder sister, Ashlee Bromwich.\n\nShe said she would watch Saffie \u201cwith wonder\u201d, adding that she loved to dance and make people laugh and would \u201cleave little notes of 'I love you' everywhere\u201d.\n\nSaffie\u2019s father Andrew said she was his \u201cperfect, precious beautiful daughter\u201d who \"melted people's hearts\" with \"those big brown eyes\", adding: \"It's like the best artists got together and drew her from top to toe.\"", "Pollution levels in the Seine have fallen sharply over the last 20 years\n\nWith a year to go to the Olympics, Paris is in the final phase of a historic clean-up which will soon see swimmers and divers back in the River Seine.\n\nBanned for a century because of the filthy water, city swimming is set to be one of the major legacies of the Games thanks to a \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn; $1.6bn) regeneration project universally hailed as a success.\n\nNot only are three Olympic and Paralympic events - triathlon, marathon swimming and Para-triathlon - scheduled to take place in the Seine in central Paris, but by 2025 three open-air swimming areas will be accessible from the quayside.\n\n\"When people see athletes swimming in the Seine with no health problems, they'll be confident themselves to start going back in the Seine,\" predicts Pierre Rabadan, deputy Paris mayor in charge of the Olympics. \"It's our contribution for the future.\"\n\nLike many Western cities, Paris saw its river quality decline drastically thanks to upstream industrial sewage and the sanitation demands of a burgeoning population.\n\nWhen people see athletes swimming in the Seine with no health problems, they'll be confident themselves to start going back in\n\nAquatic life suffered to the point where in the 1960s only three species of fish were recorded in the city. In 1923 the authorities banned swimming, though an annual Christmas cross-river competition survived until World War Two.\n\nOne of the main problems has been the 19th-Century \"single system\" drainage infrastructure, which unites household waste water from kitchens and toilets with run-off from rain on the street.\n\nIn normal times this flows through a complex of under-street tunnels to treatment centres in the outskirts. However when there is heavy rain, the system is saturated and the excess has to be drained into the Seine.\n\nImprovements over the last 20 years have already led to a sharp reduction in faecal bacteria entering the river.\n\n\"But the difficulty has been in eradicating those last few percentage points to ensure it can be officially classified as clean,\" says Samuel Colin-Canivez, chief engineer for sanitation at Paris city hall.\n\nThe solution has been to build a vast underground reservoir which will serve to store run-off in times of heavy rain. The building site can be seen by Austerlitz station - and in front of the Piti\u00e9-Salpetri\u00e8re hospital where Princess Diana died after her car crash in 1997.\n\nFrom the surface it looks like regular building work. But below, there is a huge cylindrical space 34m (112ft) in depth and 50m wide - enough to hold water from 20 Olympic swimming pools.\n\nAn underground reservoir in central Paris will store wastewater overflow\n\nMachines dig and scrape in the depths, and an excavator with a long telescopic arm reaches down from the surface to remove the earth.\n\n\"Up to now the Seine has been the safety valve for the sewage system. If we didn't occasionally allow wastewater into the river, it would have backed up into people's homes,\" says Mr Colin-Canivez.\n\n\"Now a tunnel will bring the overflow to the reservoir, where it can be stored for a day or two - the time for the system to settle down again. Then it will be drained as normal to the treatment centres.\"\n\nSamuel Colin-Canivez does not rule out very exceptional moments when even with the reservoir some wastewater ends up in the river. But these will be rare, and the city will declare the Seine temporarily \"unbatheable\".\n\nAustralian Frederick Lane won two gold medals in the Seine at the 1900 Olympics\n\nThe mega basin will be operational by next year's Games, which start in late July and will showcase the revitalised river not just as a sporting venue but also as the forum for the opening ceremony, with a flotilla of 160 boats carrying 10,000 athletes down a 6km (3.7 mile) stretch to the Eiffel Tower.\n\nOne event that will not be taking place in the river - in fact not at all - is angling. And yet in the first Paris Olympic Games in 1900, there was indeed a fishing competition (as well as a host of other other weird sports such as cannon-firing and hot-air ballooning).\n\n\"Back in 1900 they measured the fish they caught in the competition, and none was bigger than the size of your hand,\" says Bill Fran\u00e7ois of the Paris fishing federation.\n\n\"Today we have between 30 and 35 species of fish in the city centre, and we get catfish measuring 2m long. It has been a transformation.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Fran\u00e7ois, it is not only fish that have come back to the Seine, some reintroduced by angling associations. It is also molluscs, aquatic insects, sponges and crayfish.\n\n\"The bottom of the river is developing a coat of the right kind of weed. The clearer the water, the more the weed grows, and then the weed filters the water to make it even clearer - it's a virtuous circle,\" he says.\n\nBetween 30 and 35 fish species inhabit the Seine in Paris\n\nBill Fran\u00e7ois enters the Seine regularly and is confident that it is already clean enough to swim in. But he does sound one note of warning: rats.\n\n\"We anglers know the dangers of leptospirosis (a disease carried in rat urine). Some of us get annual inoculations. And there is no shortage of rats in Paris, including along the quays.\"\n\nIt is true that rats are a perennial problem in the French capital, and the sight of a rat is unlikely to encourage bathers to enter the Seine.\n\nHowever Paul Kennouche, head of water quality at Paris city hall, says studies show the amount of leptospirosis bacteria is not abnormally high.\n\n\"We have not had a single case of leptospirosis in the canal at La Villette (where swimming is already allowed), and that is the same urban environment.\n\n\"We do not have any huge concern but we will certainly be monitoring, and taking action to remove rats.\"\n\nFor 20 summers now, Parisians have enjoyed the amenity known as Paris-plages (Paris beaches), in which sections of the river-quays are transformed with sand, parasols and beach games. Only in the north of the city on the Canal de l'Ourcq was swimming permitted in 2017.\n\nNow mayor Anne Hidalgo has unveiled the three spots on the Seine which will also be open for public bathing from summer 2025. They are in central Paris near the \u00cele Saint-Louis, and at the eastern and western ends of the city.\n\nIt's not just fish, but humans too who are coming back to the river.", "Volodymyr Zelensky met Rishi Sunak during a trip to Downing Street in February\n\nRishi Sunak is \"disappointed\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been allowed to address this year's Eurovision, his spokesman says.\n\nThe organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), say it would breach its political impartiality.\n\nBut Downing Street said it would be \"fitting\" for Mr Zelensky to speak given Russia's invasion of his country.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is also calling for the Ukrainian leader to be allowed to make a speech.\n\nUkraine was meant to be hosting this year's Eurovision after winning it last year, but it is taking place in Liverpool instead after Russia's invasion.\n\nIt has been reported that Mr Zelensky wanted to make a video appearance at the contest's final on Saturday, to an expected global audience of 160 million.\n\nBut in a statement on Thursday, the EBU said it had turned down a request from the Ukrainian president to address the event, despite his \"laudable intentions\".\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is an international entertainment show, and governed by strict rules and principles,\" it added.\n\n\"As part of these, one of the cornerstones of the contest is the non-political nature of the event. This principle prohibits the possibility of making political or similar statements as part of the contest.\"\n\nBBC Director General Tim Davie told the BBC's Eurovisioncast he understood the EBU's decision and that throughout its history, Eurovision \"has not been a platform for political statement\".\n\nBut he stressed the BBC was hosting on behalf of Ukraine and that it is \"a celebration across Europe for freedom, for democracy\".\n\nThe EBU said that a Ukrainian design agency had been involved in designing artwork for the event, and 11 Ukrainian artists, including last year's winners Kalush Orchestra, would be performing.\n\nHowever, Mr Sunak's spokesman questioned the decision not to have Mr Zelensky speak, saying: \"The values and freedoms that President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they're fundamental.\"\n\nHis spokesman argued that Eurovision \"themselves recognised that last year\" by banning Russian artists from participating.\n\nHowever, he added that the prime minister had no plans to intervene and ask broadcasters to change their mind.\n\nUkraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, said the final of the contest would have been a \"great moment\" for Mr Zelensky to address a huge audience.\n\nBut speaking to PA Media, he added: \"We understand all the internal politics and the unbiased sort of approach to all this, that's why we don't have to push too much.\"\n\nUkraine will be represented at this year's contest by Nigerian-Ukrainian pop duo TVORCHI\n\nIn statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"It's vital that we all continue to keep the plight of the Ukrainian people front of mind as they stand up to Russian aggression on behalf of us all.\n\n\"Eurovision is an expression of international unity and freedom, and President Zelensky should be able to address it as a great defender of both.\"\n\nThe EBU initially said it would allow Russia to participate in the 2022 final, following its invasion of Ukraine two months before it was due to be held in Italy.\n\nBut it then changed course within 24 hours, saying that allowing Russia to take part would \"bring the competition into disrepute\".\n\nUA:PBC, Ukraine's public broadcaster, as well as those from Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, had called for Russia to be banned.\n\nBoris Johnson, who was British prime minister during Russia's invasion and oversaw the UK's initial response, said \"it would have been right to hear\" from him during the final on Saturday.\n\nFormed in 1950, the EBU has 68 broadcasting organisations as members, including the BBC - which is hosting this week's finals and semi-finals.\n\nEurovision was conceived in the 1950s as a way of promoting post-war unity between European states. As a result, politics has always been kept at arm's length.\n\nIt's a policy that's never been easy or comfortable to enforce. In 2005, Lebanon was due to make its debut when it refused to air Israel's entry. As a result, it received a three-year ban from the contest, and never took part.\n\nGeorgia also fell foul of the rules in 2009, when they submitted a song called \"We Don't Wanna Put In\".\n\nThe lyrics were a thinly-veiled critique of Russia's Vladimir Putin, following the previous year's Russo-Georgian war. When the country refused to amend the song, they were suspended.\n\nThe commitment to neutrality is so strong that, last year, organisers agonised over what to do about Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAlthough Russia was eventually banned, Eurovision's executive supervisor Martin Osterdahl said it had been a hard decision to make.\n\n\"It was, and it still is,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBut, he added: \"How Europe feels very much affects the contest. When we say we are not political, what we always should stand up for are the basic and ultimate values of democracy.\"\n\nCritics of the decision to decline President Zelensky will say the contest has already made a political move by banning Russia. And their argument isn't without merit.\n\nBut the EBU would counter that supporting a war-torn country is very different to allowing the leader of that country to make a call to arms.", "Lucy Caldwell's novel was praised for its \"pitch-perfect, engrossing narrative\"\n\nBelfast writer Lucy Caldwell has won the Walter Scott Prize for historical fiction for her novel These Days.\n\nShe was announced as the winner at the Borders Book Festival which is taking place in Melrose.\n\nShe took the \u00a325,000 top prize for her story of the aerial bombardment of her home city during World War Two.\n\nThe judges of the award praised her winning work for its \"pitch-perfect, engrossing narrative ringing with emotional truth\".\n\nFounded in 2009, the Walter Scott Prize has become one of Britain's most important literary awards with previous winners including Sebastian Barry, Robert Harris, Andrea Levy and Hilary Mantel.\n\nThe judges said Ms Caldwell's novel was a \"a story of both great violence and great tenderness\".\n\nShe immersed herself in eyewitness accounts while she was writing the book, interviewing survivors, including a 103-year-old.\n\nShe said winning the award was a \"bit overwhelming\".\n\n\"One of my absolute favourite authors is Hilary Mantel who was twice a recipient of this prize,\" she said.\n\n\"She wrote some words that are on the cover of my hardback and I thought that was the greatest privilege of my writing life to have my name alongside hers on the cover.\n\n\"So to win a prize for historical fiction which she and so many other great writers have won in the past feels incredible.\"\n\nThe other shortlisted novels for the award were The Geometer Lobachevsky by Adrian Duncan, Act of Oblivion by Robert Harris, The Chosen by Elizabeth Lowry, The Sun Walks Down by Fiona McFarlane, Ancestry by Simon Mawer and I Am Not Your Eve by Devika Ponnambalam.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "Christopher Nolan says the strike is about \"jobbing actors, staff writers trying to raise a family, trying to keep food on the table\"\n\nOppenheimer director Christopher Nolan has said he \"absolutely\" will not work on another film until the Hollywood strikes are resolved.\n\nTens of thousands of Hollywood actors have joined writers in taking industrial action, because they want streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild also wants to protect actors from being usurped by digital replicas.\n\nNolan admitted he was \"very fortunate with the timing\", as his film's premieres were held just before the strike began, meaning Oppenheimer would not be affected by industry members stopping work.\n\nChristopher Nolan (third from right) with the stars of Oppenheimer at the film's premiere in London\n\nWhen asked if he would write another film during the strike, he told BBC Culture editor Katie Razzall: \"No, absolutely.

The hardline CGT said as many as 700,000 demonstrators had turned out in Paris alone, although police figures were likely to be far lower.\n\nWith the government showing no sign of backing down on its pension plan, one union leader, Emmanuel L\u00e9pine, said last week that the aim of blocking fuel deliveries was to \"bring the French economy to its knees\".\n\nIt was unclear how long the refinery blockades would last. There are eight refineries in mainland France and the CGT said strikers had blocked the exits to all of them, including those run by TotalEnergies and Esso-ExxonMobil.\n\nRefineries around Le Havre in the north were among those blocked, French trade unions said\n\nIn the days ahead, there will be calls to extend the strikes to include power generation too.\n\nSo far, for all the noise and sporadic disruption, the campaign has caused little damage to the economy and the bill is proceeding through parliament.\n\nUnions and the Left know time is running out before the reform becomes a reality - which is all the more reason for them to up the pressure now.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has called the reform \"essential\" because of deficits forecast for France's pension system over the next 25 years, according to analysis by the independent Pensions Advisory Council.\n\nAs well as raising the pension age by two years, the government says workers would have to contribute for 43 years into France's shared pension fund before earning a full pension.\n\nVery few French workers have personal pensions linked to capital investments.\n\nNeighbouring European economies have already raised the retirement age in recent years to reflect longer life expectancy.

So warmer summers will become very much more frequent, and hot days will become very much more frequent.\"\n\nDrought was declared in several regions of the UK as a result of the heatwave\n\nOne of the elements that might have led to a very hot year in 2022 and may help explain the current wetter summer are changes in the jet stream, the fast-moving winds that carry weather systems across the Atlantic to the UK.\n\nIn recent years the jet stream has shown a tendency to get stuck, meaning that weather patterns can persist or become \"blocked\" in place for weeks. There is a school of thought that a warming climate is causing this change.\n\n\"I think the jury is out, but there is definitely some science showing that we are getting these much more persistent, static kind of weather patterns, similar to what we've got at the moment with the heatwaves,\" said Prof Liz Bentley, from the Royal Meteorological Society.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see if there's conclusive evidence that climate change has led to that. And that's going to be a pattern that we see going forward in future.\"\n\nThe authors of the Met Office study say that 2022's record year for the UK was made much more likely by climate change.\n\n\"The heatwave that is happening now across southern Europe, the heatwave that we saw last year, all of these things are fitting into a pattern,\" said Mr Kendon.\n\n\"These things emphasise that our climate is changing. And it's changing now, and it's changing fast.\"\n\nLooking forward, under a medium emissions scenario, there's a 1-in-15 chance that the UK would hit 40C in any one year by the end of the century.\n\n\"That trend for [extreme temperatures] is going to increase as we go through this century,\" said Prof Liz Bentley.\n\n\"If you look at future climate projections, we are on a path for hotter, drier summers. So 2022, for me was very much a sign of things to come in future years with our changing climate.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the government's independent climate advisers warned the UK still needed to make climate change preparations a more important priority.\n\nThe extreme 40C heat in July last year caused extensive disruption across the country, including for transport, power supply and healthcare.\n\nBut even though these temperatures will become increasingly likely with climate change, the UK still has much further to go to properly prepare for intense heat and other extreme events, such as flooding, according to its advisers.\n\nThe report also underlines some other key impacts of climate across the UK last year.\n\nThe ten-year period from 2013 to 2022 is the warmest ten-year period on record.\n\nNear coasts, surface temperatures were the highest for the UK in a series dating back to 1870.\n\nLast year was also one of least snowy years on record, compared to the last six decades.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "The spears taken by Captain Cook will be given back to the local Gweagal people\n\nAboriginal spears taken by British explorer Captain James Cook and his landing party when they first arrived in Australia in 1770 will be returned to the local Sydney clan.\n\nThe four spears are believed to be the last remaining of dozens collected by the first colonialists.\n\nThey are being kept at Cambridge University in the UK.\n\nCambridge's Trinity College has agreed to return them after a 20-year campaign by indigenous people.\n\nCaptain Cook first set foot in Australia on a beach at Botany Bay in Sydney's south, where he and his crew's arrival was challenged by two men from the Gweagal clan of the Dharawal peoples, the traditional owners of the land.\n\nMany Australians have long seen Captain Cook's landing story as a foundational event in Australia's modern history. However, this view is increasingly controversial given Aboriginal people lived on the land for tens of thousands of years beforehand and many blame colonisation for ongoing problems.\n\nThe spears will be handed back to the local Aboriginal community and displayed at a new visitor centre.\n\nRay Ingrey, chairman of the community's Gujaga Foundation, said the Gweagal people had a deep, spiritual connection with the wooden, multiple-tipped spears.\n\n\"It's part of a dreaming story that tells us how our people came to be. So not only that they're over 253 years old, and gives us a window into our historic past, but also toward that spiritual connection, which makes it so more important,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe spears were taken when indigenous people retreated into the bush after a violent encounter with the British landing party in which muskets were fired, Mr Ingrey said.\n\n\"The crew started to go through their campsite, picking up artefacts and anything that they could actually get their hands on... 40 to 50 spears were were bundled up and put on [Cook's ship] Endeavour.\"\n\nThe spears have been in a British museum since 1914\n\nThe spears were carried back to the UK and donated to Trinity College in 1771.\n\nApart from short loans to Australian museums, they have been looked after by Cambridge's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) since 1914.\n\nProf Nicholas Thomas, director of the MAA, said the spears were \"exceptionally significant\".\n\n\"They are the first artefacts collected by any European from any part of Australia ... they reflect the beginnings of a history of misunderstanding and conflict.\n\n\"Their significance will be powerfully enhanced through return to Country.\"\n\nTrinity's master, Dame Sally Davies, told ABC News the college was committed to \"addressing the complex legacies of the British Empire\" and that returning the spears was \"the right decision\".\n\nMr Ingrey said the moment held \"mixed emotions\" for him, but acknowledged the role Trinity College played in preserving the spears in a \"museum-grade facility\".\n\n\"It's been a long time for us. Our elders, over 20 years ago, started a campaign to return cultural objects.\n\n\"A lot of elders, particularly our senior women, are no longer with us.

The ham must come from Iberian blackfoot pigs that spend the last months of their lives eating acorns on the \"dehesa\", a Spanish or Portuguese pasture with old oak trees. It must also be hung and dry cured for at least 36 months.\n\nBut some US firms are now importing blackfoots to make their own ham which will be marketed as jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico armericano or Ibericus meat. They are allowed to because they are not beholden to EU law.\n\nThe US also makes it's own champagne as it never ratified the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, under which the drink became a protected brand.\n\nIndia's government forbids tea not made in Darjeeling from being labelled as such, and all producers must enter into a license agreement with the Tea Board of India. The tea can't be blended with teas of other origin and must be exported with certificates showing this. India's Tea Board went to the World Trade Organisation over what they called the unauthorised use and registration of 'Darjeeling' by Japanese companies in Japan.\n\nDespite opposition from some Belgian and Swiss firms, the EU officially recognised Cambodia's Kampong Speu palm sugar as a protected product. It's made from the sap of the palm sugar tree and is characterised by a rich aroma.\n\nThe protected status of the fruit cake is currently under consideration. Proponents say it must always be decorated with whole almonds and has to be prepared, decorated and baked at locations within Dundee postcodes.

Watch: The Pentagon leaks explained in under 60 seconds.\n\nLeaked US documents have revealed that disagreements in Russia's security apparatus led to the defence ministry being accused of undercounting casualties of the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has said very little publicly about the scale of its war deaths.\n\nBut the files show the FSB security service claimed officials were not counting deaths of the Russian National Guard, Wagner mercenaries and others.\n\nRussia has already warned the leaks may be fake, deliberately dumped by the US.\n\nHowever, the detail corroborates what was already widely known: that Russia's military and security groups have had frequent disagreements about the handling of the war in Ukraine and that Russia has avoided publicising the numbers of dead and wounded.\n\nThe FSB's reported calculation of almost 110,000 casualties by February is still far lower than numbers this week in previously leaked US documents, which estimated Russian losses at between 189,500 and 223,000 casualties, with 35,500-43,000 men killed in action.\n\nRussia's most recent official figure dates back to September last year, when the deaths of 5,937 servicemen were confirmed.\n\nThe same document says under-reporting of casualties within the system highlights the military's \"continuing reluctance\" to convey bad news up the chain of command.\n\nCommentators have often suggested that President Vladimir Putin has been shielded from the extent of Russia's losses on the battlefield, and this assessment appears to be borne out by these communications intercepts, labelled \"SI\" or Special Intelligence.\n\nAnother leaked document labelled top secret refers to an \"information war\" between the defence ministry and Wagner's mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in February.\n\nPrigozhin repeatedly accused the military of halting ammunition supplies as his men fought to capture Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe leak quotes ministry officials suggesting that they find \"allies of equal status to fight Prigozhin rather than doing so itself\".\n\nTellingly, the assessment in the leak asserts that significant losses suffered by Russia's National Guard, or Rosgvardia, will \"probably hinder Moscow's attempts to fully secure all of its annexed territories\".\n\nRosgvardia troops have taken part in combat and helped organise Russia's rigged referendums that led to Mr Putin annexing four Ukrainian regions last September.\n\nLittle is known about the identity of the leaker, but the Washington Post has reported that he is a gun enthusiast in his 20s who worked on a US military base.\n\nAccording to the Post, the leaker transcribed and then typed up the content of classified documents he had seen on the base, and then posted photos of the documents themselves.\n\nAmong the pages of photographed documents, one shows a US assessment of Russia's \"grinding campaign of attrition\" in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. It says barring an \"unforeseen recovery\" by Russian forces, Ukraine will be able to frustrate Moscow's war aims \"resulting in a protracted war beyond 2023\".\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has suggested that the US may have dumped the documents deliberately.\n\nAs a \"party to the conflict\" he argued that Washington may have sought to \"mislead the enemy, that is the Russian Federation\".\n\nWagner mercenaries have died in large numbers in the battle for Bakhmut - these military cadets attend a mercenary's funeral\n\nHowever, another intriguing leak cites Russia's Main Operations Directorate hailing a successful operation in early February aimed at convincing Ukrainian intelligence of a potential joint Russian-Belarusian offensive from Belarus.\n\nAs Russia's military campaign in the east stalled in the run-up to the anniversary of the war, there had been reports of a Russian military build-up in Belarus with the aim of reviving its failed invasion from Belarusian territory the year before.\n\nKyiv was forced to move troops to defend the area from possible attack, diverting them from the front lines in the east and south.\n\nThe leaked document cites a Directorate official recommending two more phases of activity in March \"to further mislead Ukrainian forces\". The leak makes clear the plans were being sent to Belarus's military chief for approval.", "Beekeepers at Warwick University say they are so busy collecting bee swarms, they have run out of equipment\n\nBeekeepers say they have been running out of equipment to catch a rise in bee swarms after a bout of warm weather.\n\nA long and cold spring followed by rising temperatures means larger swarms are now searching for new hives, University of Warwick experts say.\n\nMembers of the public are being advised not to panic if they spot the honeybees and instead call professionals to move them.\n\n\"It has been a very unusual year for swarms,\" said beekeeper Alan Deeley.\n\nMr Deeley, who is based at the university, added: \"We have collected so many swarms, I have run out of equipment.\"\n\nThe bee expert said this year had been much busier than usual, with swarm season starting a month earlier in April.\n\nMr Deeley said: \"Last summer we had a very good good year for the bees - they went into the winter very strong.\n\n\"It was then a long, cold, wet spring which meant the bees were confined to the hive and that is a trigger for them to swarm.\"\n\nMr Alan Deeley says a long cold spring followed by warm weather had led to an increase of swarms\n\nBeekeepers will inspect hives once they reach 15C, however at the start of the year, temperatures remained low so they were unable to control the swarms, Mr Deeley said.\n\n\"As the weather improved, they just swarmed like mad,\" he added.\n\nProfessor David Chandler, a microbiologist and entomologist at Warwick University said: \"We only have honeybees now because of beekeepers.\n\n\"There are no wild honeybees in this country because honeybees are affected by a parasitic mite which feeds on their blood - it's an invasive species.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Just a year ago, at the Platinum Jubilee, it had been his mother on the same balcony, appearing before the crowds.\n\nIt is the first time a monarch has ridden on horseback at the event since 1986, when the late queen rode her horse, Burmese.\n\nHe was joined by the other royal colonels on horseback - the Prince of Wales and the Princess Royal.\n\nThe King's horse appeared to be a little skittish at the start, but calmed down as the event went on.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh also rode during the ceremony in his role as Colonel of the 1st Battalion London Guards.\n\nThe ceremony started at Buckingham Palace, with the King and senior royals travelling down The Mall towards Horse Guards Parade.\n\nThe colour - or regimental flag - was then trooped in front of hundreds of Guardsmen and officers from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards.\n\nThere was music and marching while the King carried out an inspection of the soldiers - moving slowly along the line as they stand in formation.\n\nAfter he coursed through the Mall, the King received the royal salute as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Household Division's regiments.\n\nThe senior royals on horseback were joined by the Queen, the Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, who travelled in a carriage to support their grandfather.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThousands gathered to watch King Charles at the birthday parade\n\nPrince George of Wales, Prince Louis of Wales and Princess Charlotte of Wales rode along in the carriage\n\nThe Duchess of Edinburgh and Vice Adm Sir Timothy Laurence, during Trooping the Colour\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak was spotted in the crowd, as well as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, along with prime ministers of Commonwealth states and realms.\n\nOne royal fan said they were \"so happy\" to be at Trooping the Colour after missing out on the King's Coronation.\n\nThey said: \"We're so happy about coming today.

In its latest update, it said four people had been charged, while another person arrested remains in custody for non-payment of fines.\n\nFifty-seven people have been released on bail while two others will face no further police action.\n\nAmong those held on Saturday was the head of the anti-monarchy group Republic, Graham Smith. He was released after 16 hours in custody and said there was \"no longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK\".\n\nOther concerns have been raised over reports three volunteers with a Westminster-based women's safety programme had been arrested while handing out rape alarms.\n\nThe Met said it received intelligence protesters were planning to use rape alarms to disrupt coronation proceedings.\n\nMs Frazer said the right to protest was \"really important\" and people should be heard but there had been a recent change in protesters' tactics.\n\nProtesters have been stopping people going about their day-to-day lives, she said, and there was a need to redress that balance.\n\nOfficers would have made operational decisions on a case-by-case basis, she said, taking into account the scale of the Coronation celebrations.\n\n\"We were on the global stage, there were 200 foreign dignitaries in the UK, in London at an event, millions of people watching and hundreds of thousands of people at the scene,\" she added.\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC he was reassured the Met were aware of a gap in public confidence over policing and the force was \"explaining and justifying\" why they made some of the arrests.\n\nHe said Labour would \"wait and see\" whether the force got the balance right, adding \"accountability\" over policing decisions was important.\n\nMr Streeting said if they did not get it right, it was important to \"hold your hands up\".\n\nThe King and Queen went past some protesters on their way to Westminster Abbey for the Coronation ceremony\n\nMetropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay defended her officers' response, saying they had a duty to intervene \"when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption\".\n\nShe added the Coronation was a \"once-in-a-generation event\" which was a key consideration in their assessment.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered in the rain in central London on Saturday, with chants including \"down with the Crown\", \"don't talk to the police\" and \"get a real job\".\n\nBut Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said some of the arrests \"raise questions\" over the Met's actions, adding he has \"sought urgent clarity\" whilst investigations are ongoing.\n\nOther protests were organised in Cardiff, Glasgow and Edinburgh. No arrests were reported outside London.\n\nWhile campaigners insisted their protests were peaceful, the police said they had intelligence that groups were \"determined to disrupt\" the occasion.\n\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey said he was not sure about the exact circumstances of the arrest, and called for more detail from the police.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he criticised the government for \"passing legislation to clamp down on protest that breached British traditions of civil liberties\".\n\nSeveral Labour MPs have also been critical of the Met's response. Senior backbencher Sir Chris Bryant said on Twitter that \"freedom of speech is the silver thread that runs through a parliamentary constitutional monarchy\".\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Republic chief Mr Smith said the arrests had \"destroyed whatever trust might have existed between peaceful protesters and the Metropolitan police\".\n\n\"What is the point in being open and candid with the police, working with their liaison officers and meeting senior commanders, if all their promises and undertakings turn out to be a lie?\"\n\nMr Smith was arrested early on Saturday - before the Coronation began - at a protest in Trafalgar Square.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Met said it had confiscated \"lock-on devices\" which protesters can use to secure themselves to things like railings.\n\nIt has now become illegal to prepare to lock-on following changes to the law passed this week.\n\nBut Matt Turnbull, another member of Republic who was arrested, said the straps were being used to hold the placards and had been \"misconstrued\" as lock-on devices.\n\nA former police chief has said she is \"very disappointed\" by the arrest of protesters and strongly criticised the new powers.\n\nSue Sim, a former chief constable with Northumbria Police and a specialist in public order policing, said she was \"very disappointed\" by the arrest of protesters and called the new powers \"draconian\".\n\n\"I think when you're talking about terrorism, where people's lives are at risk that's a very different thing. But where you are talking about peaceful protest the whole thing for me is, what type of society do we want? We do not want a totalitarian police state,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend.\n\nConcerns about the police's approach were also raised by Westminster City Council over reports that volunteers with its Night Star women's safety programme had been detained and questioned after being stopped by officers while handing out rape alarms.\n\nCouncillor Aicha Less said the authority was working with the Met to establish what happened and was in touch with volunteers to make sure they were being supported.\n\nThe Met said it had received intelligence about plans to use rape alarms to disrupt the Coronation procession by scaring military horses, causing \"significant risk to the safety of the public and the riders\".\n\nThe force said three people were arrested in the Soho area of London over suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.\n\nOne man was also further arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

Rishi Sunak says the Acorn project will strengthen the UK's energy security strategy\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the decision to grant 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences.\n\nThe UK government has also said it will support a carbon capture project in the north east of Scotland.\n\nCampaigners said that extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea would \"send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments\".\n\nBut Mr Sunak said granting the new licences was \"entirely consistent\" with net zero commitments.\n\nIt comes as the party faces internal divisions over its green policies - such as the review over low-traffic neighbourhoods in England - with some MPs calling for a rethink.\n\nMr Sunak confirmed support for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, Aberdeenshire, on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, then later visited the site.\n\nIt is one of four carbon capture projects which will share up to \u00a320bn of funding.\n\nMr Sunak said the announcement would support thousands of jobs across the UK.\n\nHe said granting the new oil and gas licences was \"the right thing to do\".\n\nThe Acorn Project will be located at St Fergus gas terminal in Aberdeenshire\n\nHe said: \"Even when we reach net zero in 2050, a quarter of our energy needs will still come from oil and gas and domestic gas production has about a quarter or a third of the carbon footprint of imported gas.\"\n\nThe prime minister also said it made \"absolutely no sense\" to import energy supplies with \"two to three times the carbon footprint of what we have got at home\".\n\nHe said increasing home-grown sources of energy would improve the UK's resilience, create jobs and generate tax revenue to fund public services.\n\nMr Sunak said the government was determined to transition to net zero in a \"proportionate and pragmatic\" way.\n\nAnd he also defended his plans to fly to Scotland as \"an efficient use of time for the person running the country\" and highlighted investment in new technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nThe prime minister said: \"If your approach to climate change is to say that no one should go on holiday, no one should go on a plane, I think you are completely and utterly wrong.\"\n\nThe Acorn project in St Fergus in Aberdeenshire missed out, quite controversially, on track one of funding for this back in 2021.\n\nInstead it went to two projects in the north of England.\n\nThat was highly controversial because there had been heavy hints placed that the Scottish project would form part of that.\n\nIt was one of the most advanced projects in the UK, if not the most advanced, and then suddenly it was dropped.\n\nThe accusation was that the Conservative government at Westminster was favouring Red Wall constituencies following its success at the last general election.\n\nBut it was always the case that this would be a sequencing of events.\n\nBetween the projects announced in 2021 and today 10 mega tonnes of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored by 2030, the UK government says.\n\nThat includes emissions from Mosmorran, from Grangemouth, from a new power station to be built at Peterhead and, potentially, from direct air capture.\n\nIt effectively sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and also stores it.\n\nLabour's Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives' energy policy had left Britain as \"the worst hit country in Western Europe during the energy crisis\".\n\nMr Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: \"Rishi Sunak's weak and confused policy will not take a penny off bills - as his own party chair has admitted - will do nothing for our energy security, and drive a coach and horses through our climate commitments, while continuing to leave us at the mercy of fossil fuel dictators like Putin.\"\n\nAnd Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the new oil and gas licences demonstrated the UK government was \"not serious about tackling the climate emergency\".\n\nHe tweeted: \"For the PM to announce unlimited extraction of oil & gas, in the week the UN has confirmed July is set to be the hottest month in human history, shows the PM is willing to recklessly gamble the future of our planet for cheap political gain.\"\n\nThe St Fergus project is a joint venture between Shell UK and other companies.\n\nIt would become Scotland's first carbon capture and storage facility, which would see harmful greenhouse gas emissions piped under the North Sea.\n\nThis would prevent the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, by capturing it at the point where the fossil fuel is being burnt.\n\nThe UK government said its \"decisive action\" would provide highly-skilled jobs for young people in the region.\n\nIt added this package would \"defend the public\" against the disruption of global energy supplies by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHowever, climate campaigners criticised the decision to award new fossil fuel licences.\n\nOxfam climate change policy advisor Lyndsay Walsh said the announcement was another example of the government's \"hypocritical and dangerously inconsistent climate policy\".\n\nShe added: \"Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.\"\n\nMike Childs, head of policy at environmental charity Friends of the Earth, said the government needed to focus on energy efficiency and home-grown renewable resources rather than \"championing more costly and dirty fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"Climate change is already battering the planet with unprecedented wildfires and heatwaves across the globe.\"\n\nAnd Fabrice Leveque, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said politicians should be focusing on helping households to transition to clean heating rather than \"chasing the mirage of cheap domestic fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"These new licences will do nothing to cut households' energy bills and ignore the best way to boost our energy security - reducing demand for fossil fuels in the first place by insulating homes and replacing oil and gas boilers and vehicles with clean alternatives that run on cheap, homegrown renewables.\"\n\nBurning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the main driver of climate change.\n\nThe carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.\n\nCarbon capture technology is seen by policy makers as a vital tool in reaching the net zero target by the middle of the century.\n\nSome environmentalists, however, are against it because they consider it a distraction from the urgent need to cut emissions.\n\nThe Acorn Project has been under development in various forms for more than a decade.\n\nIt had hoped to be one of the first projects of its kind to receive government backing in 2021, but lost out to two projects in the north of England around the Humber and the Mersey.\n\nSNP Westminster leader and MP for Aberdeen South, Stephen Flynn, said \"broken promises\" had left Scotland's green energy future in jeopardy.\n\nWelcoming the investment, he added: \"There can be no more broken promises or delays. Now is the time to strike on Scotland's green energy potential.\"\n\nThere have been questions raised about the government's ability to meet its 2050 net zero target, with its climate advisers having warned the UK risks falling behind without much faster action.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Sunak said he was committed to meeting the target in a \"pragmatic and proportionate way\" but without \"unnecessarily adding costs and burdens to families\".\n\nNet zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nMr Sunak has faced calls from some Tories to change the deadline for the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesels cars, but told the Sunday Telegraph he was not planning to do so.\n\nThere has also been debate over the expansion of London's ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which was widely seen as helping Conservatives seal a narrow victory in the Uxbridge by-election.\n\nBoth Mr Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have urged London mayor Sadiq Khan to reflect on the rollout as people struggle with cost-of-living pressures.", "Ukraine's military has not commented on US media reports that Kyiv may be now running dangerously low on its artillery stockpile\n\nNumerous attacks have been repelled in the area of eastern Donetsk over the last 24 hours, Ukraine's military says.\n\nRussian forces claim they are about to take the eastern city of Bakhmut - the focus of intense fighting for many months.\n\nThe head of Russia's Wagner private army claims it is \"practically encircled\" with limited routes out.\n\nThe deputy mayor of the city told the BBC there was street fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.\n\nBut Oleksandr Marchenko said Russia was not yet in control, despite constant shelling.\n\n\"They have no goal to save the city... their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people,\" Mr Marchenko told the Today programme.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence said Bakhmut is under \"increasingly severe\" pressure.\n\nAccording to the UK intelligence, Russian forces and Wagner troops have made further advances into northern suburbs, making the Ukraine-held section of the city vulnerable to Russian attacks on three sides.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, visited Bakhmut on Friday for meetings with local commanders on how to bolster front-line forces.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu made a rare visit to Russian-held Ukrainian territory in southern Donetsk.\n\nRussian troops have been trying to take Bakhmut for over six months.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned this week that the situation on the eastern front line was becoming \"more and more difficult\".\n\nA key concern for Ukraine is its ever-decreasing ammunition stocks as the high-intensity war with Russia shows no sign of slowing.\n\nThe US has announced a further $400m (\u00a3333m) in military aid to boost Kyiv's depleted ammunition stocks.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country's latest package included high-precision Himars artillery rockets and howitzers \"which Ukraine is using so effectively\".\n\nPresident Zelensky earlier stressed that artillery and shells were needed to \"stop Russia\". The US is also sending tactical bridges ahead of Ukraine's expected offensive.\n\nThe delivery of such equipment - allowing armoured vehicles to cross rivers and ditches - comes as Ukrainian military officials and experts have suggested the offensive could begin in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Mr Blinken said: \"This military assistance package includes more ammunition for US-provided Himars and howitzers, which Ukraine is using so effectively to defend itself\".\n\nHe added that Washington would also be sending \"ammunition for Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridges, demolitions munitions and equipment, and other maintenance, training and support\".\n\nHimars proved to be extremely effective during Ukraine's lightning counter-offensive late last year that saw almost the whole of the Kharkiv region brought back under Kyiv's control.\n\nThose advances - and the liberation of the southern city of Kherson - were the most significant front-line changes since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April.\n\nIn his statement, America's top diplomat stressed that \"the United States also continues to rally the world to support Ukraine\" in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe new US military aid package was announced amid reports in US media that Ukraine may now be running dangerously low on artillery stocks after more than a year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia are believed to be firing tens of thousands of artillery shells every day in what is seen as a high-intensity war of attrition in recent months.\n\nUkraine's military have not publicly commented on the reported shortage of ammunition. However, President Zelensky on Thursday said that \"artillery is number one that we need\".\n\nHe added that Kyiv also needed \"a large quantity of shells\" and war planes to \"expel\" Russian troops from Ukraine's territory.\n\nMilitary assistance to Ukraine was expected to dominate the agenda as US President Joe Biden met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington on Friday.\n\nMr Biden thanked the German leader for his country's \"profound\" support of Ukraine.\n\nA number of Ukraine's Western allies have pledged to deliver tanks and artillery - but Kyiv says this must be done much faster to deter further Russian aggression.", "Eight people have been killed in the US state of Texas after a car struck a group at a bus stop close to a shelter for the homeless and migrants.\n\nThe incident happened in the city of Brownsville near the Mexican border at about 08:30 local time (14:30 GMT).\n\nAt least five other people have been injured, some of them critically.\n\nThe driver has been arrested and charged. Brownsville police say it is not clear whether the incident was intentional.\n\nPolice are still investigating whether the attack was deliberate or accidental, and whether the driver - who has not yet been publicly identified - was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez said that the driver has \"thus far been uncooperative\" with investigators.\n\nA police department spokesman told the New York Times that police are also looking into reports that the driver shouted anti-migrant remarks.\n\nHe spoke to police officers in both English and Spanish, gave various names and refused to submit to a breathalyser test, the spokesman added.\n\nVideo reportedly taken at the scene appears to show the driver being restrained by police officers and taken to a waiting vehicle. In the video - which cannot be independently verified by the BBC - the driver is shirtless and wearing boots coloured like the flag of Texas.\n\nLocal authorities will hold a news conference at 1130 Est (1530 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe director of the nearby Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, Victor Maldonado, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that surveillance footage showed an SUV running a red light and approaching the bus stop at speed.\n\nThe vehicle then hit the curb and flew about 200ft (60m) - hitting those in its path.\n\nMr Maldonado said that roughly half an hour before the incident, a group of around 20 people who had been staying at the centre left and walked over to wait at the bus stop. He earlier told the Associated Press that most of the victims were Venezuelan men.\n\nSome had been intending to catch a local bus downtown to link up with other buses heading to different parts of the US, for which they already had tickets.\n\n\"All the staff and myself, we're trying to hold it together,\" Mr Maldonado said tearfully.\n\n\"A lot of the folks that we have here are mums with kids, and single males. Right in front of their eyes, they were witnessing a tragedy.\"\n\nHe added that he had not witnessed any hostility towards migrants in the city but is quoted telling KRGV-TV, a local media outlet, that people had come to the gate since the incident and told the security guard the reason it had happened \"was because of us\".\n\nAccording to US border protection officials, the city of Brownsville has recently seen a sharp increase in illegal migrant arrivals.\n\nMr Maldonado also told local media, quoted by AP, that in the past two months the Ozanam Center, an overnight shelter that can hold up to 250 people, has been handling up to 380 people a day.\n\nOfficials in Brownsville issued a disaster declaration last month, following other Texas border cities that have done the same.\n\nThat's ahead of an anticipated influx of migrants due to the upcoming expiry of a Covid-era policy that allowed the US to automatically expel undocumented migrants.", "Barbara Bolton died of pneumonia brought on by profound hypothermia\n\nAn 87-year-old woman who did not heat her home because she was worried about high energy bills died after she was found suffering from profound hypothermia.\n\nBarbara Bolton's inquest was told she had ignored pleas from her family to heat her terraced house in Bury.\n\nShe was discovered by her grandson at her kitchen table, unable to speak, on 11 December and later died in hospital.\n\nA conclusion of misadventure was recorded by the coroner in Rochdale.\n\nThe court heard that while Mrs Bolton's family had encouraged her to put her heating on and told her not to worry about the cost, she would not listen.\n\nThe coroner described how medics found she had a body temperature of just 28C rather than a healthy reading of 37C.\n\nShe was taken to Fairfield Hospital in Bury but died of pneumonia brought on by hypothermia on 5 January.\n\nSenior coroner Joanne Kearsley told Mrs Bolton's son Mark: \"What comes across clearly from both the hospital statements and from your own is how much, as a family, you cared and looked after your mum.\n\n\"I think it was evident from the hospital that whatever had happened at home wasn't because the family weren't encouraging her to put her heating on or telling her not to worry.\n\n\"It's clear she was fixated on the worry of putting her heating on no matter what anyone was saying to her.\"\n\nThe inquest heard hospital notes recorded that Mrs Bolton had deliberately not turned her heating on \"for fear of high energy bills\".\n\nIn his statement read to the court, Mark Bolton said his mother had only given up work as a Tesco pharmacy assistant at the age of 82 and medical evidence presented to the court said she had hardly ever visited a GP.\n\nMr Bolton said family members spoke to her every day and visited her often.\n\nHe described how she would put a gas fire on in her living room when people visited and would only use heaters that her family had bought her when they were there.\n\nHe told the hearing his mother was \"old school\" and said: \"It was my way or no-one's way with my mum.\"\n\nRecording a conclusion of misadventure, the coroner said: \"She seemed like quite a remarkable woman, still working at 82.\"\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

I'm sure that he's going to be very, very motivated to win. On the other hand, I am, too.\"\n\nThe match is also a repeat of last year's quarter-final when Sinner came close to beating Djokovic, before the veteran fought back from two sets down to win.\n\n\"It's going to be a completely different match than last year,\" said Sinner, who is only playing in the Wimbledon main draw for the third time.\n\n\"He knows me better, as I know him better. It's going to be also a little bit tactical.\n\n\"In the other way, it is also going to be a little bit mental. It's always tough to play against Novak, especially at Grand Slams.\n\n\"But I'm happy. I will fight for every ball. I will enjoy the moment, but knowing that I can go hard and trying to beat him.\"\n\nEven if Djokovic does beat Sinner, there is still guaranteed to be a first-time Wimbledon finalist in the shape of Alcaraz or Medvedev.\n\nThe pair have both won major titles on the US Open hard courts, but will attempt to reach their first Wimbledon final after a summer of marked improvement at the All England Club.\n\nAlcaraz had only played two senior tournaments on the surface going into this summer, but showed his potential by winning the Queen's title and continued to impress this fortnight.\n\nAfter beating fellow 20-year-old Holger Rune in the quarter-finals, Alcaraz said it was a \"dream\" to reach the last four at Wimbledon.\n\nBut the world number one knows he faces a stern examination against Medvedev, who he described as a \"really complete player\".\n\n\"I think [Andrey] Rublev said a few times, he's an octopus. He catches every ball. It is amazing. He's an amazing athlete,\" said Alcaraz.\n\n\"I think a mix of everything. He does almost everything well.\"\n\nFormer world number one Medvedev also had little pedigree at Wimbledon before this year, having never previously gone beyond the last 16.\n\nMost of the 27-year-old's success has come on hard courts, notably when he won his first major title at the 2021 US Open.\n\nGrass courts have been his least successful surface in recent years, leading to Medvedev saying before the tournament he was hoping to change his fortunes.\n\nThe Russian was not able to play Wimbledon last year after players from his nation were banned because of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"I always said I want to be here, I want to play. Wimbledon is an amazing tournament and I wanted to do well because it was my worst Grand Slam,\" he said.\n\n\"I never managed to get into the flow here.

Watch: Tim Davie explains why he believes that internal BBC complaints are handled properly\n\nThe BBC was under \"huge pressure\" to reveal that Huw Edwards was the presenter facing media allegations last week, its acting chairwoman has said.\n\nA Sun story about an unnamed presenter who had allegedly paid a teenager for explicit photos sparked a media storm.\n\nThe BBC board held two emergency meetings in the next two days, acting chair Dame Elan Closs Stephens said.\n\n\"We had a duty to act with some calm and rationality in the face of lack of rationality and lack of calm.\"\n\nThe claims began when the Sun newspaper reported that a mother had accused the News at Ten presenter of paying their teenage child tens of thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos, which they said the young person spent on drugs.\n\n\"There were an awful lot of questions that could not be answered,\" Dame Elan told a House of Lords committee on Tuesday.\n\n\"There was a huge pressure to disclose the name of somebody to whom we had a duty of care and a duty of privacy, in addition to the family and young [person] that were concerned in this maelstrom.\n\n\"So I was, on the one hand, seeking to establish the right of the board to oversee what was happening. But at the same time, I was trying my best to make for a calm and rational discussion of the issue before we all got carried away in what could have been very wrong directions.\"\n\nDirector general Tim Davie said the the BBC was carrying out a \"fact-finding investigation\"\n\nAfter five days, Edwards' wife Vicky Flind disclosed on Wednesday that he was the presenter at the centre of the allegations.\n\nShe also revealed he was in hospital after the situation had brought on a \"serious\" mental health episode, and said he would address the allegations when he is well enough to do so.\n\nFollowing the Sun's original reports, the young person later denied the claims through their lawyer, and police said they found no evidence of criminal activity.\n\nMeanwhile, other people came forward with claims of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nThe BBC has now resumed its own internal investigation.\n\nDirector general Tim Davie told the House of Lords communications and digital committee: \"We're in the process of looking at those facts, and we're keen to receive any information, because we just want to understand anything that's out there.\"\n\nThe BBC had tried to balance \"difficult concerns around the allegations themselves, duty of care, privacy, and legitimate public interest\", he said, adding that it has been \"a difficult affair.\"\n\nMr Davie also said BBC executives had been in touch with the complainant since the allegations were first reported.\n\n\"Obviously we want to be engaged, and appropriately listening, and understanding [their] concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe family originally contacted the organisation in May, and the BBC has been criticised for the speed of its response to their complaint.\n\nBoth Mr Davie and Dame Elan became aware of the allegations seven weeks later, the day before the Sun published its first story.\n\nThe director general said the BBC's \"protocols and procedures\" were now being reviewed, and that he had \"immediately\" asked for a \"quick look\" at how \"red flags\" are raised when allegations are made.\n\nBeyond the Edwards situation, the director general was asked whether all high-profile and highly-paid presenters had a responsibility to uphold the BBC's reputation.\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied. \"The history of this industry is such that we should all be concerned and appropriately diligent around the abusive people in powerful positions.\n\n\"Certainly you have a dynamic when you've got presenters or people in power... you need to ensure that you're very, very clear about what your expectations are culturally as well as the policy.\"\n\nThe BBC had done \"really good work\" in having a \"really clear code of conduct\" and reminding staff of the organisation's values, he added.", "Fang Bin has been released after three years in jail, sources say\n\nFang Bin, who documented the initial Covid outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has been freed from jail after three years, sources told the BBC.\n\nMr Fang is one of several so-called citizen journalists who disappeared after sharing videos of scenes in Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic.\n\nAfter disappearing in February 2020, he was sentenced to three years in jail at a secret trial in Wuhan, sources said.\n\nHe was released on Sunday and is in good health, they added.\n\nMr Fang is now back home in Wuhan. The BBC could not reach his family for comment.\n\nThe video that caught the attention of the outside world was one where he counted eight body bags outside a Covid hospital in the space of five minutes. He said he was detained that night but released. Then came a video with the message: \"All people revolt - hand the power of the government back to the people\". That was the last video he shared.\n\nAlthough activists have welcomed his release, they are concerned about the fate of another whistleblower - Zhang Zhan, a 39-year-old former lawyer, was detained in May 2020 and jailed for four years in December 2020.\n\nLike Mr Fang, she too was convicted for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\", according to activists who say the vague offence has often been used against critics of China's government. Two other citizen reporters Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua also disappeared in Wuhan in February 2020, but surfaced months later.\n\nTheir videos provided a rare glimpse into Wuhan in the early months of 2020. Cases were climbing and lockdowns had come into force, but information from officials remained scarce. Wuhan's 76-day lockdown - which inspired the country's harsh zero-Covid strategy - put the city under severe strain.\n\nMs Zhang, who lived in Shanghai, travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the outbreak after reading about a resident's experience. She was active on YouTube and Twitter, both of which are banned in mainland China, and continued sharing videos despite reportedly being threatened by local authorities.\n\n\"Maybe I have a rebellious soul... I'm just documenting the truth. Why can't I show the truth?\" she said in an interview with an independent filmmaker that was obtained by the BBC.\n\nShortly after the arrest, she began a hunger strike and was sometimes force-fed as her weight plummeted to under 40kg (88lb), according to the Free Zhang Zhan group. It's unclear if she is still on a hunger strike. Her family knows little about her condition.\n\nLast December, her brother uploaded photos of a letter written by Ms Zhang in now-deleted tweets. She drew flowers on the envelope to reassure their mother, he said.\n\nIn the letter, Ms Zhang mostly asked after her mother, who had recently undergone surgery and chemotherapy. She added that she was being treated well by the authorities.\n\nThis tweet showing an envelope with Zhang Zhan's drawing has been deleted\n\nMr Fang's release came quietly and with no warning as China tries to move on from the pandemic. Years of gruelling lockdowns and unyielding Covid rules took a huge toll, but their abrupt end late in 2022 brought on a devastating Covid wave.\n\nThe country has reported 120,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Nearly half of those were recorded between 8 December 2022 and 12 January 2023. But the numbers don't represent the true toll.\n\nIn February, the Chinese Communist Party's top leaders declared a \"decisive victory\" over Covid, boasting the lowest fatality rate in the world. They also said the country's Covid exit was a \"miracle\".\n\nA new history textbook talks of how the government \"achieved major achievements in co-ordinating the prevention and control of the pandemic\".\n\nAnd China's swift and effective censorship machine also means that the videos and accounts shared by those such as Mr Fang or Ms Zhang will likely fade from memory, if they haven't already.\n\n\"I visited China in March, and my observation is that people there want to move on and leave the past behind,\" says Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"They had to endure the draconian zero-Covid for a prolonged period, and now they yearn for a return to a more normal way of life.\" But, he adds, that this desire to move on is also driven by the lack of public discussion or debate.\n\nNot everyone in Wuhan has forgotten what life was like in early 2020.\n\nOne 31-year-old resident, who did not wish to reveal his full name, said he had not heard of Fang Bin but does remembers Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn the world about the coronavirus and died after contracting it. Mr Li was investigated for \"spreading rumours\", although local authorities later apologised to him.\n\nHe says he often talks about the pandemic with his friends, even though he admits they might be a minority.\n\n\"Society is revising the memory of this period,\" he says. He said he lived with his parents throughout the lockdown. His mother would be so anxious and wash her hands so often that her hands cracked because of it.\n\n\"My mum still doesn't really understand the virus. If the media start reporting about virus again, she will wear a mask. She is really frightened.\"\n\nAnd there are others like Yang Min, who lost her only child to Covid in January 2020. She believes an early warning from officials would have saved her daughter.\n\nNow, three years on, she is still fighting to hold officials accountable and trying to file a lawsuit against the local government.\n\nShe is under surveillance but, she told the BBC earlier this year, she was not afraid.\n\n\"I have already lost the most precious thing in life. What else can they take away from me?\"", "Hollywood star Brad Pitt was seen strolling among the crowds on Thursday\n\nHollywood actor Brad Pitt, who has been cast as an F1 driver in a movie, will be seen racing at Silverstone during the British Grand Prix weekend.\n\nPitt is to be filmed racing an adapted Formula 2 machine between practice sessions on Friday.\n\nBritish champion Lewis Hamilton is helping to produce the film featuring the American actor.\n\nThe 59-year-old Oscar-winner is playing the role of a veteran driver returning to the grid after a 30-year absence.\n\nThe plot line has raised eyebrows, given Pitt's age, but Hamilton said: \"Brad looks like he's ageing backwards.

She's sitting in the back of court,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nFocusing on specific babies in the case, Mr Johnson later asked the jury to consider the evidence of the mother of Child E.\n\nShe told the court in November last year that she went to feed her son, who subsequently died, on the night of 3 August 2015.\n\nChild E's mother said she heard her son making \"horrendous\" sounds when she arrived on the neonatal unit and found him with blood around his mouth.\n\nShe told the court that she saw Ms Letby stood near a work station on the unit and when she alerted her to the blood, she was told it was due to a feeding tube.\n\nMs Letby in her evidence denied having this interaction and said no blood was sighted in Child E's mouth before 22:00 that night.\n\n\"Have [the parents] made that up, to get at Lucy Letby? Are they in on it? Are they a sub-gang of two?\" Mr Johnson asked.\n\nMr Johnson said this was \"a head on credibility contest\" and either Child E's mother was \"lying\" or Ms Letby was \"lying\".\n\nHe said of the mother's account: \"It's powerful evidence - independent of the medical evidence - that Lucy Letby murdered [Child E]\".\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

At 14, she saved up money from cleaning jobs to buy a stray horse called Bomber, who was kept in a stables located behind Hackney town hall.\n\nSome of Moyes's work has been adapted for the big screen, including Me Before You\n\nJobs on a market stall and a mini-cab office followed after school before she landed a bank job and was sent on a management course taking place at Oxford University.\n\n\"All my school mates' horizons were very limited so... I didn't have an idea of what I wanted to do,\" she says.\n\n\"It wasn't just the environment... I was surrounded by really ambitious young people. Everybody had a goal. And they were the first people I met who had goals and by the end of that week, I didn't want to go home.\"\n\nShe broke off her engagement with her then-boyfriend and applied to London's City University before embarking on a career in journalism, ending up at the Independent alongside the likes of Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding.\n\n\"I watched that turn into a column that spoke to so many women my age at the time - early 20s - and I suddenly had that feeling of 'wow, if she can do it, so can I'.\"\n\nBut Moyes had her first three books rejected, which she describes as \"crushing... like someone telling you your baby is ugly\", although she wasn't going to give up.\n\n\"There's definitely a girder of bloody-mindedness running down my spine. I can't see why I can't do something.\n\n\"My mum used to put it down to me being very premature as a baby. She was told I was going to die. I was 10 weeks early. There's this bit of me that just says, 'No, I'm going to do it!'\"\n\nHer third book, about an art heist, was knocked back after being deemed too political for the female market and too romantic for the male market at the time.\n\nMoyes's next eight books went to print but did not exactly set the publishing world alight.\n\nBy the time she wrote her hit 2012 novel Me Before You, one publisher had told her her career was \"unrecoverable\" and she had built an extra room on her house so she could rent it out to a lodger.\n\nShe says the reason Me Before You - about a woman who is a carer for a man with paralysis and later falls in love with him - got past a few thousand words was down to Sophie Kinsella, the bestselling author of the Shopaholic series.\n\n\"She took me out for lunch, I told her about this idea I'd had for a book. I said I'm not sure about it. And I told her the whole thing.

It was up to individual states to decide whether to remain monarchies or became republics, he added.\n\nThere will be questions about whether the Commonwealth will remain a diplomatic priority for the UK.\n\nThe King's symbolic first state visits will be to build relationships with France and Germany, with the European destinations decided by the government.\n\nBut his message at the Commonwealth Day service argued for the strength of bringing together different cultures within the Commonwealth, saying: \"By listening to each other, we will find so many of the solutions that we seek.\"", "Some of the victims died as attackers burnt a dormitory\n\nNearly 40 pupils have been killed at a school in western Uganda by rebels linked to the Islamic State group (IS).\n\nFive militants attacked the Lhubiriha secondary school in Mpondwe at around 23:30 (20:30 GMT) on Friday.\n\nThey entered dormitories, setting fire and using machetes to kill and maim the pupils, officials said.\n\nThe Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) - based in the Democratic Republic of Congo - have been blamed and a manhunt is under way.\n\nMore than 60 people are educated at the school, most of whom live there.\n\nUganda's information minister said 37 students were confirmed to have been killed, but did not give their ages.\n\nTwenty of them were attacked with machetes and 17 of them burned to death, Chris Baryomunsi told the BBC.\n\nThe Ugandan army said the rebels had also killed a school guard and three members of the local community.\n\nSurvivors said the rebels threw a bomb into the dormitory after the machete attack. It is not clear if this resulted in a fire in the building which was reported earlier.\n\nSix students were also abducted to carry food that the rebels stole from the school's stores, he added. The militants then returned across the border into the DR Congo.\n\nSome of the bodies are said to have been badly burnt and DNA tests will need to be carried out to identify them.\n\nEight people remain in a critical condition after the attack.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the \"appalling act\" and called for those behind it to be brought to justice.\n\nSoldiers are pursuing ADF insurgents towards the DR Congo's Virunga national park - which is home to rare species, including mountain gorillas.\n\nMilitias including the ADF also use the vast expanse, which borders Uganda and Rwanda, as a hideout.\n\n\"Our forces are pursuing the enemy to rescue those abducted and destroy this group,\" defence spokesperson Felix Kulayigye said on Twitter.\n\nThe Ugandan army has also deployed helicopters to help track the rebel group over mountainous terrain.\n\nThe two neighbours have held joint military operations in the east of DR Congo to prevent attacks by the ADF.\n\nSecurity forces had intelligence that rebels were in the border area on Congolese side for at least two days before Friday night's attack, Maj Gen Olum said.\n\nBut local residents have criticised the authorities for not being prepared for an attack.\n\n\"If they are telling us the borders are secure and security is tight, I want the security to tell us where they were when these killers came to kill our people,\" one resident told reporters.\n\nThe deadly episode follows last week's attack by suspected ADF fighters in a village in DR Congo near to the Ugandan border. More than 100 villagers fled to Uganda but have since returned.\n\nThe attack on the school, located less than 2km (1.25 miles) from Congolese border, is the first such attack on a Ugandan school in 25 years.\n\nIn June 1998, 80 students were burnt to death in their dormitories in an ADF attack on Kichwamba Technical Institute near the border of DR Congo. More than 100 students were abducted.\n\nThe group may target schools as a way of recruiting children, according to Richard Moncrieff, an expert in the region at the International Crisis Group. But they also do it for the shock value, he told the BBC.\n\n\"These are terrorist groups who want to make and impact through violence, they want to show that they are there, show that they are active to their colleagues and allies in Isis in other parts of the world,\" Mr Moncrieff said, using another acronym for IS.\n\nThe ADF was created in western Uganda in the 1990s and took up arms against long-serving President, Yoweri Museveni, alleging government persecution of Muslims.\n\nMuslims make up almost 14% of the Ugandan population, according to official government figures, though the Ugandan Muslim Supreme Council estimates the figure is closer to 35%.\n\nSome members of the Ugandan Muslim community say they face discrimination in public life, including in education and the workplace.\n\nAfter defeat by the Ugandan army in 2001, the ADF relocated to North Kivu province in DR Congo.\n\nThe group's principal founder, Jamil Makulu, was arrested in Tanzania in 2015 and is in custody in a Ugandan prison.\n\nADF rebels have been operating from inside DR Congo for the past two decades.\n\nMakulu's successor, Musa Seka Baluku, reportedly first pledged allegiance to IS in 2016, but it was not until April 2019 that the group first acknowledged its activity in the area.\n\nIS is a group has been mostly defeated, though there are significant numbers of IS-affiliated militant groups across the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAfter years of not operating openly in Uganda, the ADF was blamed for a series of attacks in late 2021 including suicide bombings in Uganda's capital Kampala.\n\nDR Congo allowed Uganda to cross the border to assist in efforts against the ADF in 2021", "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been accused of delaying a decision on the future of his deputy Dominic Raab.\n\nA lawyer-led inquiry into bullying allegations against Mr Raab was widely expected to be published on Thursday.\n\nBut that did not happen, prompting opposition parties to accuse the PM of \"dithering\".\n\nMr Sunak needs to decide whether Mr Raab, one of his closest allies, has broken ministerial rules and must be sacked or resign.\n\nThe PM received the inquiry's findings at around 11:30 BST on Thursday, with No 10 saying earlier it would be published \"as swiftly as possible\".\n\nSenior figures had also been briefed to expect a decision on the same day the report was received.\n\nThe BBC has been told Mr Raab has seen the full report.\n\nMr Raab, who is also justice secretary, denies bullying staff and says he always \"behaved professionally\". He is facing eight formal complaints about his behaviour as a minister.\n\nSenior lawyer Adam Tolley KC was appointed by the prime minister to investigate the allegations in November. But it will be for Mr Sunak to decide whether Mr Raab has broken ministerial rules and what action to take.\n\nSomebody who advised Mr Raab in a senior role in one department told the BBC: \"This waiting only extends the anxiety for those who were brave enough to step forward and speak out, particularly those who have had to continue working with Raab at the Ministry of Justice.\n\n\"The PM's prevarication makes it feel more likely that the whole thing, the last five months of agony for Raab's subordinates, will end in a whitewash.\"\n\nShadow attorney general Emily Thornberry called on Mr Sunak to \"stop dithering and delaying\" over Mr Raab's fate.\n\n\"If he's a bully, he should go - and the prime minister really should be able to read the report, make up his mind, and get on with it,\" she added.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats also accused Mr Sunak of \"dither and delay\".\n\nThe party's chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: \"It feels like almost every week there is an issue with sleaze and scandal where Rishi Sunak is either implicated in himself or too weak to get to grips with it.\"\n\nAnd Dave Penman, the boss of the FDA union representing senior civil servants, said making those who raised complaints wait another day showed the system was a \"complete farce\".\n\n\"You have to be very brave\" to make this type of complaint, he said, adding it was not a decision civil servants would have taken \"lightly\".\n\nAsked if he would accept the prime minister's decision, Mr Penman told BBC Breakfast: \"If he does after all of those complaints, say that Dominic Raab is essentially innocent and hasn't breached the ministerial code, he's going to have to explain to an awful lot of civil servants why that's the case.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newscast, Sir Alex Allan - who conducted an inquiry into bullying allegations against former Home Secretary Priti Patel - said the delay suggested the findings of the report could not be \"completely clear cut\".\n\n\"Otherwise he [the prime minister] would have come out with a decision one way or the other,\" he added.\n\nThe former ethics adviser also said having the prime minister decide if Mr Raab had breached rules, rather than the author of the report or the No 10 ethics adviser, was not \"very satisfactory\".\n\nThere are conversations taking place in government circles about what will happen next if the justice secretary leaves his position.\n\nIf he resigns, or is sacked, that would trigger a reshuffle of Mr Sunak's cabinet.\n\nSome senior figures in government are bracing for the report to be damning, and feel he might have no choice but to go.\n\nHowever, the ultimate decision lies with the prime minister and a final judgement has not been made yet.\n\nThe complaints against Mr Raab, involving at least 24 people, related to his previous periods as justice secretary and foreign secretary under Boris Johnson and his time as Brexit secretary under Theresa May.\n\nThe MP for Esher and Walton was sacked as justice secretary and deputy prime minister when Mr Johnson was succeeded by Liz Truss.\n\nHowever, he was reappointed to the two roles when Mr Sunak entered Downing Street in October.\n\nThe prime minister has been under pressure to explain what he knew about the allegations before reappointing Mr Raab to the cabinet.\n\nHe has repeatedly declined to say whether he had informal warnings about Mr Raab's behaviour before bringing him back into government.", "Japan has become increasingly divided over its commitment to post-war pacifist ideals\n\nToshiyuki Mimaki says he remembers crying as he looked up at a blackened sunset after the nuclear bomb hit Hiroshima.\n\nHe was only three years old at the time, but he remembers the dazed and burnt survivors fleeing past his home in the countryside. He remembers heading into the city with his family, searching for his father in an apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nOver the years he has recounted these fragmented but vivid memories to school children, to journalists, to anyone seeking to document the trauma of the hibakusha, or the atom bomb survivors. These days, they are a small and dwindling group.\n\n\"There are only a few people like us who experienced the war and the atomic bombing. We are dying,\" Mr Mimaki says, while sitting in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, where world leaders attending the G7 summit laid wreaths on Friday.\n\n\"Sooner or later, there will not be a single hibakusha. How will Japan change by then?\"\n\nIt's a fear that echoes through Japan. The world around them has changed. Japan itself has aged and its post-war miracle economy has sputtered, dwarfed by China's market and might. An anxious Japanese public now wants greater protection from new threats knocking at their door.\n\nThe governing Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), whose hands have long been tied behind its back by voters averse to militarisation, suddenly finds the knots loosening. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government is embarking on the biggest military spending spree in decades, and seeks to expand its armed forces.\n\nEach move to militarise leaves Japan more divided over its pacifist ideals.\n\n\"The world is going through a period of turmoil right now,\" Mr Mimaki says. \"Recently, Prime Minister Kishida started talking about raising the military budget. I thought: Are you going to start a war?'\"\n\nBrought to its knees by the use of atomic bombs against Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan transformed from an imperialist power into a pacifist nation in a matter of years.\n\nIts post-war constitution, adopted in 1947 and imposed by occupying US forces, cemented this transformation. It contains a clause known as Article 9: the first paragraph renounces war, while the second promises to never maintain military forces.\n\nThe genesis of Japan's pacifism, Article 9 is at the heart of the country's struggle to balance the need for defence with its desire for peace. Some believe the law has weakened Japan, but others argue that to change it is to relinquish pacifism and forget the painful lessons of history.\n\nFaced with significant public opposition, numerous leaders have tried and failed to revise Article 9. But with every security challenge, Japan's government has succeeded in expanding its interpretation further.\n\nThe Self-Defense Forces (SDF), Japan's answer to a military, were created in response to the Korean War and the start of the Cold War. In the 1990s, during the first Gulf War, Japan sent the SDF on peacekeeping missions, dispatching its forces to overseas conflicts for the first time. More recently and controversially, in the face of a rising China and unpredictable North Korea, the late prime minister Shinzo Abe pushed through laws that allowed Japanese troops to fight overseas alongside allies in self-defence.\n\n\"Pacifism is an id\u00e9e fixe of the Japanese public\u2026 they are not going to abandon it,\" says James D Brown, an associate professor of political science with Temple University Japan.\n\n\"Instead, there is a process of reinterpreting what pacifism means. Where once it meant opposition to the use of armed force, it now means opposition to aggression and acceptance of the use of force in the name of self-defence in a growing list of circumstances.\"\n\nJapan is once again at a turning point, facing unprecedented challenges that have stoked a fear of encirclement.\n\nAn assertive China is spending billions on its military. It has made increasingly daring moves in the South China Sea, especially against Taiwan, which sits on the doorstep of Japan's southernmost islands. This has fuelled Japanese anxiety that should conflict break out in Taiwan, Japan would not only be pulled into a war between the US and China, but also targeted as an ally. It hosts US military bases and has the biggest concentration of troops outside America.\n\nNorth Korea poses a perennial existential threat. Its nuclear ambitions have grown more alarming in the past year, with a record number of missile launches, including several that have flown over Japan. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the possibility that it might use nuclear weapons - which this weekend's G7 summit is addressing - has also spurred worries of a nuclear war. The perils of a tighter Moscow-Beijing alliance also loom.\n\n\"There is a general understanding in Japan that we are now living in a very rough neighbourhood,\" says Kazuto Suzuki, an international security and political science professor with the University of Tokyo.\n\nCalls for greater militarisation have long been the domain of a minority of conservatives seeking to reclaim national pride. But recent polls show the wider public warming to the idea.\n\nMore people now want a bigger and stronger SDF, from 29% in 2018 to 41.5% last year, according to government surveys. Support for Japan's security alliance with the US has gone up to an overwhelming 90%; and 51% are in favour of amending the second part of Article 9, which stops Japan from having a military.\n\nEven some in Hiroshima are open to it.\n\n\"Every time I hear the news about [North Korea's] missiles, I am horrified,\" says a woman who identified herself as Ms Tanaka. \"There are cases in today's world where people are attacked out of the blue\u2026 I wonder if it is necessary to see [the spending] as something to protect ourselves.\"\n\nThe Hiroshima Genbaku Dome was the only structure left standing near the hypocentre of the atomic bomb\n\nThis is music to the LDP's ears. The party, whose founding principle is to advocate for constitutional reform, has always pushed for militarisation, particularly under Abe. In recent years the government has also come under pressure from Washington - notably former President Donald Trump - to do more in their security alliance with the US.\n\n\"The government has always wanted to move forward with increasing capabilities in the SDF. In the past the public has been a brake,\" Prof Brown says. \"Now, that brake is no longer there.\"\n\nUnder Mr Kishida, Japan has purchased fighter jets, refurbished aircraft carriers, and ordered hundreds of Tomahawk missiles. He has pledged to spend 43tn yen ($311bn; \u00a3250bn) on defence in coming years. By 2027, Japan's military budget will account for 2% of its GDP, and become the third-largest in the world. The LDP is also once again pushing to revise the constitution to spell out the SDF's existence and make it clear that Japan can maintain a military for self-defence.\n\nIronically, Mr Kishida has long been considered a dovish figure within the LDP. With close ties to Hiroshima - his relatives died in the nuclear attack - he has advocated for a nuclear-free world. He has even written a book on it. The choice of Hiroshima to host the G7 summit appears to be deliberate as he seeks to ram home the importance of an anti-proliferation strategy.\n\nMr Kishida's argument is that to maintain peace in Asia, Japan needs to drastically upgrade its defence. But some observers also believe that his reputation gives his government's push to militarise a more politically acceptable sheen.\n\n\"Dovish figures can make hawkish moves because people don't suspect their motives,\" Prof Brown noted.\n\nBut even Japanese hawks don't broach the idea of building a nuclear arsenal. Unsurprisingly that remains a forbidden topic in the only country to ever be attacked with a nuclear weapon.\n\nYet Japan's pursuit of a sturdier defence has seen Abe and then Mr Kishida cross what some consider to be red lines.\n\nFormer PM Abe and Mr Kishida have both pushed for more militarisation\n\nMany within Japan, and neighbours such as China, worry what other taboos the country might break in the future.\n\nOne possibility currently being debated is whether Japan should send lethal weapons to aid countries under invasion, such as Ukraine. Mr Kishida recently visited and met Volodymyr Zelensky to pledge support. Tokyo already supplies non-lethal defence equipment to Kyiv.\n\nThis, notes Prof Suzuki, would be a \"test case for Taiwan\". There are already questions over how far Japan would aid the US in a conflict with China over the island.\n\nA more controversial idea is hosting US nuclear weapons, a proposal which shocked Japan last year when it was mooted by Abe. Public support for this option, known as nuclear sharing, is still low, and last year Mr Kishida rejected the idea, saying it ran counter to Japan's stance against nuclear weapons.\n\nStill, Japan could change its mind under certain circumstances, experts say. These include South Korea gaining nuclear weapons, an increased threat from China and Russia, or if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\n\nEvery time Japan crosses a new red line, or mulls over taking that leap, it intensifies the struggle over its post-war identity and its commitment to pacifism.\n\nSome argue that despite its drive to militarise, Japan's ideals are still intact. While its pacifism may appear \"seemingly inconsistent\" through the years, its anti-nuclear and anti-war sentiments have remained alive, says Daisuke Akimoto, an expert on pacifism.\n\nWhat is happening now is simply Japan's \"security policy strengthening in response to the changing strategic environment,\" says Dr Akimoto, an adjunct lecturer at Hosei University in Tokyo.\n\nProf Suzuki agrees. \"I do have a trust in the Japanese intent,\" he says. \"I do have the belief that Japan has committed in the last 80 years to not go to war. We had a very bad experience, and we won't do it again.\"\n\nBut others are not so sure. They believe that the constant redefinition of pacifism stretches the principle to its breaking point.\n\n\"I think the way [the government] is doing it is dirty,\" says Sara Ogura, a student visiting Hiroshima. \"They are interpreting in such a way that it deliberately opens up opportunities for the use of force. It leads me to distrust them.\"\n\nWhile the government said \"they have no intention of going to war now, I think they are kind of getting ready to go to war when the time comes,\" says anti-nuclear weapons activist Yuna Okajima.\n\nSome also believe the willingness to militarise is fuelled by the lack of a national reckoning with Japan's own wrongdoings. While there is mandatory \"peace education\" in schools that covers the two world wars, discussion about Japan's role as the aggressor and the atrocities it committed in World War Two is often muted.\n\nGraduate student Misuzu Kanda believes that Japan's \"negative history with other countries is sometimes covered up by the nuclear weapons issue\".\n\n\"I was born in Hiroshima prefecture. The peace education is provided mostly from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki perspective, talking about how we suffered. But at the same time, when we think about peace, I think we need to reflect back on what we did to other countries.\"\n\nHer friend, Ms Okajima, agrees. \"I think it is a kind of proof that the Japanese government is not willing to face this history. That's why they would not teach it to young children, it's to nurture a patriotic spirit, I assume.\"\n\n\"But if we do not look at our history as perpetrators, there is a higher chance we would make the same mistake.\"\n\nCompletely flattened by the atomic bomb, Hiroshima today is a tidy and picturesque city nestled among mountains, carrying few traces of its past apart from the Genbaku Dome, the only structure left standing near the hypocentre of the attack.\n\nAcross a glittering river, at the Peace Memorial Park, lies a cenotaph honouring those who died in the nuclear attack. An inscription is carved in the marble: \"Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil\".\n\n\"The atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the end because we started a war,\" says Mr Mimaki as he gazes at the cenotaph. \"Hiroshima was burned, Nagasaki was burned, and it was the Imperial Japanese Army that made those mistakes.\"", "Lilavati Devi broke down as she told the BBC her 22-year-old son was still missing\n\nRelatives of the victims of Friday's deadly three-train crash in India have spoken of their continuing, desperate efforts to find their loved ones.\n\nOne woman looking for her adult son told the BBC she had travelled for 30 hours to the crash site, searching hospitals and morgues on the way.\n\nOfficials said on Saturday that their rescue mission in Odisha had ended - but one eyewitness said he had seen a survivor retrieved the next morning.\n\nA signalling fault is emerging as the likely cause of the disaster - India's worst rail accident for decades.\n\nLilavati Devi broke down as she told the BBC on Sunday that that she was still looking for her son, although other eight members of her family who were on one of the trains had been located.\n\n\"I pray that we find him somewhere - one way or another,\" she said. \"There's nothing more I want.

Israel has not said whether it was behind the attack.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had \"completely lost his mental balance\", Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was quoted as saying on his ministry's website.\n\nThe escalation was designed to show the world that Iran was a \"paper tiger\", said Fawaz Gerges, professor of International Relations at London School of Economics. It also represented a significant loss to the Quds force, \"which is really for coordination and arms and technology transfers to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria\".\n\nHamas's military wing, the Qassam brigades, has said Brig Gen Zahedi had a \"prominent role\" in the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel, which sparked the current war in Gaza that is threatening to spread. Iran has denied a role in the attack itself but backs Hamas with funding, weapons and training.\n\nHowever Iran's options for retaliation for the Damascus strike may be limited in scope and number, Mr Gerges and other experts told the BBC.\n\n\"Iran is not capable of a big confrontation with Israel given its military capabilities and economic and political situation,\" said Ali Sadrzadeh an author and analyst of Middle East affairs. \"But it will have to come up with a response for domestic consumption and to protect its reputation among its regional allies.\"\n\nMr Gerges also said Iran was unlikely to retaliate directly against Israel, \"even though Israel really humiliated Iran and bloodied Iran's nose\".\n\nInstead Iran was likely to exercise \"strategic patience\" because it will prioritise a more important goal: making a nuclear bomb.\n\n\"[Iran is] accumulating power, it's enriching uranium, it's making progress. And the big prize for Iran is not really to send 50 ballistic missiles and kill 100 Israelis, but to establish strategic deterrence, not only against the Israelis, but even against the US state.\"\n\nHezbollah in Lebanon has been trading fire with Israel since the war in Gaza began\n\nSince Israel's war in Gaza, missile and drone attacks by Iran-backed militia in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen against Israel interests have escalated but they seem to have limited their actions short of provoking Israel into a full-scale war.\n\n\"Even an attack against an Israeli diplomatic mission by Iran's proxy forces seems difficult to imagine,\" said Mr Sadrzadeh, although he did predict that current attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militia against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are \"very likely to continue, especially against vessels that are somehow linked to Israel or the US\".\n\nHezbollah is one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world - independent estimates suggest the group has between 20,000 and 50,000 fighters, and many are well-trained and battle-hardened through their participation in the Syrian civil war.\n\nThe Iran-backed Lebanese group has an arsenal of an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.\n\nYet the experts the BBC spoke to thought it unlikely that the group would launch a major escalation against Israel.\n\n\"Hezbollah does not really want to fall into Israel's trap because they realise Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet are desperately trying to expand the war,\" said Mr Gerges.\n\n\"The political future of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the continuation of the war in Gaza and its escalation into northern fronts with Hezbollah and even with Iran itself.\"\n\nMr Sadrzadeh believes Iran is likely to show a \"symbolic\" reaction rather than risking a direct war with Israel.\n\n\"Iran is an expert in carrying out symbolic attacks like the one in response to the killing of its most important military commander Qasem Soleimani,\" Sadrzadeh said, referring to a ballistic missile attack by Iran against an Iraqi air base where US troops were stationed - a week after the US assassinated the Iranian general in Baghdad.\n\nDespite Iran's promise of \"severe revenge\", no US military personnel stationed at the base were killed, and there were reports that the US military had been warned in advance of the incoming missiles.\n\nTop Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was killed by a US airstrike on his vehicle at Baghdad airport in January 2020\n\nYousof Azizi at Virginia Tech's School of Public & International Affairs believes that there will be a struggle going on behind the scenes in Iran between those who argue that Iran should seek to establish itself as a nuclear power to deter Israeli aggression and more hawkish figures who suggest direct attacks on Israel and its military installations.\n\nBut he told the BBC that an analysis of state media interviews and key social media accounts suggested the policy of \"strategic patience\" was likely to prevail.\n\nSo what other avenues are open to the Iranians?\n\n\"We cannot rule out that perhaps Iran may use cyberspace as another dimension to take revenge on Israel, either to perform cyber-attacks on information technology, and to cripple, and to steal, and to leak information, or to try to distract at least operational technology,\" Tal Pavel of the Israeli Institute for Cyber Policy Studies told the BBC.\n\n\"We know that during the past decade and a half, there is an ongoing clandestine cyber war between Iran and Israel. So in this case, it may be just another stage,\" he said.\n\nIt will be up to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to decide what action Tehran ultimately takes.", "Madonna has said she is \"on the road to recovery\" in her first statement since a bacterial infection left her in a hospital's intensive care unit.\n\nOn social media, the singer said \"my focus now is my health\" and thanked her fans for their \"positive energy\".\n\nThe star, 64, said: \"I assure you, I'll be back with you as soon as I can!\"\n\nThe pop star said her current plan was to reschedule her forthcoming North American concerts and begin her Celebration Tour in the UK in October.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The result, many believe, will decide whether the relationship between Catalonia and Madrid improves or flares up once again.\n\n\"If the right wins, the situation could complicate in Catalonia,\" said Lola Garc\u00eda, a journalist at La Vanguardia newspaper who wrote an account of the 2017 crisis.\n\n\"We might well go back to seeing heightened tensions there.\"\n\nIncumbent Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has sought to re-engage with pro-independence leaders\n\nSocialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez declared improving the febrile atmosphere in Catalonia a priority when he first took office in 2018, and again when he formed a new coalition government in 2020.\n\nWith that aim in mind, his administration pardoned nine politicians who had been jailed for their role in the 2017 independence bid.\n\nIt also reformed the penal code, eliminating the crime of sedition and modifying the crime of misuse of public funds - both of which changes benefitted Catalan leaders who were facing legal action.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr S\u00e1nchez's government has also engaged in slow-moving talks with the pro-independence Catalan administration aimed at resolving the territorial problem.\n\n\"Today the situation in Catalonia is nothing like it was in 2017, 2018 or 2019,\" Mr S\u00e1nchez said recently, describing the Socialists as \"a party that defends the union of Spain\".\n\nHowever, reducing the tensions in Catalonia has come at a cost for Mr S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe conservative People's Party (PP) and far-right Vox have repeatedly attacked him for making concessions to nationalists and for receiving the parliamentary support of the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC).\n\nThe four main candidates, from left to right: Current PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Deputy PM and Sumar party leader Yolanda D\u00edaz, Vox party leader Santiago Abascal and Popular Party leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o\n\nHis reliance on the parliamentary votes of the Basque nationalists of EH Bildu - the successor to the political wing of the defunct Basque group Eta, which is deemed a terrorist organisation by the EU - has compounded that opprobrium, with some in his own party also expressing unease.\n\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the PP's candidate for prime minister, warned that Mr S\u00e1nchez has \"made Spain a hostage of those who want to break the territorial unity of our country\", a message many voters seem to endorse.\n\nThe conservative leader has also tacitly criticised Mariano Rajoy, the PP's prime minister during the 2017 Catalan crisis.\n\n\"We probably should have acted earlier and not let things go as far as they did,\" Mr N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o said, suggesting he would be more proactive than his predecessor.\n\nA Spanish government that is hostile to regional identities could have an upside for the independence movement, reviving it after several years of in-fighting, according to journalist Lola Garc\u00eda.\n\nShe also believes plans by the Catalan government, led by the moderate ERC, to stage a Madrid-approved referendum on independence in the coming legislature are likely to go nowhere.\n\n\"The Catalan government is aware that it will not achieve [a negotiated referendum] either with the PP in government or the Socialists,\" she said. Instead, she believes the regional administration is pushing for increased powers within its current arrangement as an autonomous region.\n\nWith the PP ahead of the Socialists according to most polls, but looking unlikely to secure an absolute majority, it is quite possible that Spain's next government will be formed by the conservatives in a coalition with the hardline unionists of Vox.\n\nWe know a PP-Vox government would mean a threat to political freedoms and rights and democratic institutions here\n\n\"We already know that a PP-Vox government would mean a threat to political freedoms and rights and democratic institutions here in Catalonia,\" said Meritxell Serret, minister of Foreign Action and the EU for the Catalan government.\n\nShe pointed to areas of Spain where the two right-wing parties have already formed governing partnerships since local elections in May, such as the Valencia region and the Balearic Islands.\n\nIn both cases, the new local government has announced plans to eliminate the office for defence of local languages, which opponents see as an attempt to eliminate regional identities.\n\nWhile Ms Serret says the Catalan government is not satisfied with the concessions made by the S\u00e1nchez administration, she frames the possibility of Vox entering a right-wing coalition in dramatic terms.\n\n\"Vox have been threatening they will illegalise pro-independence parties, for example,\" she said.\n\n\"We fear, and people fear, that they can represent a step back for our democracy to very dark moments when civil rights [and] freedoms were not only attacked, but were annulled.

Watch: Nigel Farage says he 'wants answers' after bank apology\n\nBanking boss Dame Alison Rose has apologised to Nigel Farage for \"deeply inappropriate\" comments made about him in a document on his suitability as a Coutts customer.\n\nThe boss of NatWest Group said in a letter to Mr Farage that the comments did not reflect the bank's view.\n\nUKIP's ex-leader has said his Coutts account was closed because the bank did not agree with his political views.\n\nMr Farage said Dame Alison should now be questioned by MPs about the issue.\n\nDame Alison's apology came after the government announced new plans to force banks to explain account closures.\n\nShe said that as well as apologising to Mr Farage, she was \"commissioning a full review of the Coutts' processes\" on bank account closures. Coutts, a private bank, is owned by the NatWest Group.\n\nIn the letter to Mr Farage she said she believed \"very strongly that freedom of expression and access to banking are fundamental to our society and it is absolutely not our policy to exit a customer on the basis of legally held political and personal views\".\n\nMr Farage had put in a request to the bank to see documents relating to the decision to close his Coutts account.\n\nThe BBC had previously reported that it had been told that Mr Farage had fallen below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, citing a source familiar with the move.\n\nThe 40-page document given to Mr Farage, published by the Daily Mail, included minutes from a meeting in November last year reviewing his suitability as a client.\n\nIt stated continuing to have Mr Farage as a customer was not consistent with Coutts's \"position as an inclusive organisation\" given his \"publicly stated views\".\n\nIt mentioned Mr Farage's retweet of a Ricky Gervais joke about trans women and his friendship with tennis player Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to Covid vaccinations.\n\nIt gave several examples, including his comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to the Taliban, and his characterisation of the RNLI as a \"taxi-service\" for illegal immigrants, to flag concerns that he was \"xenophobic and racist\".\n\nOn Thursday Dame Alison also reiterated her offer to Mr Farage of alternative banking arrangements with NatWest and said she wanted to ensure they provide \"a better, more transparent experience for all our customers in the future.\"\n\nFollowing her apology, Mr Farage was asked if he thought that she should now resign.\n\n\"I think what needs to happen is the Treasury select committee needs to reconvene, come out of recess, and let's give her the opportunity to tell us the truth,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Farage also said the Telegraph had reported how the BBC's business editor Simon Jack had sat next to Dame Alison at a dinner on 3 July and the next day he had then been called by Mr Jack and told \"the reason my bank account had been closed was that I had insufficient funds in the account.\"\n\nHe said: \"I want to know, did Alison Rose breach my client confidentiality? Did she break GDPR rules?\"\n\nParliament is now in recess until September.\n\nAsked whether it would reconvene in the meantime to discuss the issue, a spokesman for the Treasury Select Committee said it will be calling on \"relevant people as witnesses and keep our programme under constant review at our regular meetings\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe apology to Mr Farage came after the Treasury announced plans to subject UK banks to stricter rules over closing customer accounts.\n\nBanks will have to explain why they are closing accounts and they will have to give a notice period of 90 days before closing an account, to allow people more time to appeal against the decision.\n\nThe new rules are likely to be brought in after the summer, the BBC understands.\n\nThe changes will not take away a bank's right to close accounts of people deemed to be a reputational or political risk.\n\nInstead, it will boost transparency for customers, the Treasury said.\n\nTreasury minister Andrew Griffith said: \"Banks occupy a privileged place in society and it is right that we fairly balance the rights of banks to act in their commercial interest with the right for everyone to express themselves freely.\"\n\nDame Alison said she welcomed the plans and would implement the recommendations.\n\nThe Treasury began looking at the issue in January after PayPal temporarily suspended several accounts last year.\n\nOn Wednesday Rishi Sunak warned it \"wouldn't be right if financial services were being denied to anyone exercising their right to lawful free speech\".", "The Isle of Innisfree was towed to Calais overnight\n\nAn investigation has been launched into the cause of a fire which broke out on a ferry in the English Channel.\n\nIt started in the engine room of the Isle of Innisfree at 17:30 GMT on Friday and was contained, according to Irish Ferries.\n\nThe vessel was towed to Calais overnight by a French coastguard tug.\n\nA total of 94 passengers and 89 crew disembarked on Saturday morning after docking, marine authorities confirmed.

That was a theme until late on, with the result still uncertain until McTominay stepped up.\n\nScotland's intent was clear. Get at Cyprus down the flanks, particularly the left. That pattern was fairly consistent, but the first real threat came down the other side when Aaron Hickey danced into the box and, from the tightest of angles, forced goalkeeper Demetris Demetriou into a low save at his post.\n\nClarke's side were cruising, comfortable on the ball and showing an impressive level of composure.\n\nThe left flank proved the route to the crucial opening goal as Stuart Armstrong fed Andy Robertson, who timed his run perfectly to stay marginally onside and cross first time. The ball deflected perfectly into McGinn's path as he instinctively raced to meet it and finish from close range to take his Scotland tally to one more than the talismanic James McFadden.\n\nChe Adams came close after super interplay with McGinn, but his shot was tipped over and the unfortunate striker left the field early in the second half with a worrying looking injury.\n\nThe second half show dipped significantly and the creeping doubt began to emerge that Cyprus might just nick something.\n\nFinally, though, Scotland got there - thanks to three of their own substitutes. Ryan Christie did superbly to win possession and fire in a cross ,Lyndon Dykes nodded it on and McTominay raced onto it to half-volley home.\n\nAn enormous cheer and accompanying sigh of relief engulfed Hampden before McTominay capitalised again when Robertson laid the ball into his path and he calmly dispatched it home with ease.\n\nThe 3-0 scoreline adds significant and welcome gloss to the occasion. Clarke will be delighted with that but equally happy to get through this unscathed.\n\nIt became something of a struggle until very late on, but the players stayed calm and avoided a calamity.\n\nThe initial signs were very positive in the first period, with Scotland in complete control.\n\nThey were perhaps a touch cautious in getting into dangerous areas directly in front of goal, but the performance was strong and promised more as the game wore on.\n\nThat said, Cyprus were very well organised and proved sticky opposition.\n\nThe concern will be how standards seemed to slip. There was little composure in the final pass or deliveries from wide areas, but the substitutes made a significant impact to get Scotland over the line.\n\nWhat they said\n\nScotland head coach Steve Clarke: \"We spoke a lot about getting off to a good start and I thought we started the game really well. The movement, the rotation of the players, the creation of space was good. We deserved the lead at that time.\n\n\"I thought up until 30 minutes we were good and I don't know whether we went a bit casual, we switched off a little bit and Cyprus made it difficult for us. Second-half was a slightly difficult game and we slowed the game too much, but it is nice to look at the bench and bring on Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie.\"\n\nCyprus head coach Temuri Ketsbaia: \"I believe we lost to the better team. Scotland deserved to win the game, well done to them. Congratulations.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that we didn't give our best. We tried to change our formation, we tried to put more offensive players.

You know, there was an incident somebody raised a complaint about unwanted contact, which was verbal contact.\n\n\"There was never any physical contact. I've never had any physical contact. I've never used any sexual language. I've never propositioned anybody,\" Mr Danker said.\n\nSexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature, says Alison Loveday, an employment lawyer at Lockett Loveday McMahon Solicitors.\n\n\"It must have either violated someone's dignity, whether it was intended or not, or created an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them, whether it was intended or not.\"\n\nA former CBI staff member, who has been in touch with existing workers at the organisation, said they were \"furious\" and \"upset\" by Mr Danker's interview.\n\n\"It's important that we remember who the victims of this situation are: the women who've had negative experiences with men at the CBI,\" she said.\n\n\"They have described to me feeling furious, grossed out and upset by Danker's attempts to downplay his role in this situation.

Brian McBride, president of the CBI, said sacked director-general Tony Danker was \"selective\" in his description of allegations.\n\nThe CBI is facing a number of claims from 2019 including drug use as well as serious sexual assault which is being investigated by City of London police.\n\nMr Danker said his reputation has been \"totally trashed\" because these claims emerged a matter of weeks after the business lobby group disclosed that it was looking into separate allegations of misconduct against him.\n\nThe CBI has said Mr Danker's dismissal followed an independent investigation into specific complaints of workplace misconduct against him.\n\nMr Danker admits that he did look at the Instagram profiles and stories of \"a very small number of CBI staff, men and women\".\n\n\"The CBI already knew that some people thought that that was intrusive, and I get that,\" he said.\n\n\"I get that people felt that it was wrong, that I was looking at their admittedly completely public Instagram stories\", he added.\n\nMr Danker, who joined the CBI in November 2020, also acknowledged he had messaged around 200 individual staff members, but said it was part of building \"rapport\" during lockdown as well as with colleagues who continue to work from home.\n\nHe said these messages said things such as: ''Hi, how are you? How was your weekend? Show me pictures of your dogs or your babies\".\n\nBut he believed some people had thought the messages inappropriate, and they had not realised Mr Danker had \"been doing this to everyone to try and build rapport.\"\n\nFinally, he said that the invitations to junior staff for lunches and breakfasts were part of a CBI mentoring scheme called the Shadowing Programme. Mr Danker said both male and female employees were invited by Mr Danker to discuss their careers.\n\nIn Mr Danker's recollection, the \"private\" karaoke party came after people suggested it after a CBI Christmas party in 2021.\n\nMr Danker said he booked a room for 15 people which was \"the largest I could get\".\n\n\"I emailed everybody saying 'here's the address', no cameras allowed', because everybody said to me 'I don't want to be filmed singing karaoke',\" he said.\n\nAsked why he has chosen to speak publicly, Mr Danker said he'd rather not talk to the media.\n\nBut he said: \"It is just not OK to throw somebody under the bus and ask them to be the fall guy when their entire reputation is destroyed.\"\n\nBut Mr McBride said Mr Danker had been sent a legal letter setting out the grounds for his dismissal \"in detail\", but had not been shown the report of the independent investigation by law firm Fox Williams to keep the complainants anonymous.\n\n\"The board lost its trust and confidence in his ability to lead the organisation and represent the CBI in public,\" Mr McBride said.\n\nMr McBride said the CBI also wished to make clear that Mr Danker \"is not the subject of any of the more recent allegations\", including rape.\n\nThe CBI - the Confederation of British Industry - is one of the UK's leading business lobby groups, claiming to speak for 190,000 companies.\n\nSince the scandals emerged, major companies that are members have paused engagement with the group or expressed their concerns. The government has also stopped working with the CBI while investigations continue.\n\nHowever, Mr McBride said: \"I don't believe that government should wait for 18 months for the result of a potential rape case\" to talk to the CBI, adding that the organisation expected to get back to lobbying \"quite quickly\".\n\nIf you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues discussed in this story?

Many use genuine pictures of pass certificates and driving licences which have been taken from promotional images posted on real driving school social media accounts.\n\nThe posts provide limited information about how these licences are provided without taking a test, most posts just provide a mobile number or ask people to contact them for more information via a direct message.\n\nThe BBC contacted several people advertising these services on social media, posing as someone without any driving experience who was looking for a licence.\n\nOne man advertising on Facebook claimed he could provide a UK driving licence for \u00a3720, with the pass certificate delivered to the reporter's home in five days - without anyone actually sitting a test.\n\nA theory test costs \u00a323 and the practical test \u00a362, but the RAC estimates the total cost of learning to drive is \u00a31,551 including tests and lessons - assuming the person passes first time. In Northern Ireland the tests cost \u00a323 for the theory and \u00a345.50 for the practical test.\n\nOne woman who advertised on Facebook in Vietnamese told our reporter she charged \u00a31,600 for help with cheating the theory test and \u00a32,600 for the practical driving test - a total of \u00a34,200.\n\nShe said first she needed to see what the reporter looked like to ensure she had a suitable lookalike to take the tests.\n\nThe BBC also tracked down a woman who paid for a fraudulent service. She had found someone via a Facebook post to take the practical test for her son who had been struggling to pass.\n\nThe mother paid the fraudster about \u00a31,000 after he had passed the test on her son's behalf.\n\nIf the woman's son is ever caught he would have his licence revoked and face prosecution for fraud, potentially resulting in a prison sentence and/or a fine.\n\nTikTok and Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC that the solicitation of driving licence fraud is not allowed on their platforms and any content found that violates their guidelines will be removed.\n\nTikTok also says it has taken action against a number of accounts following the BBC Investigation.\n\nDriving instructors have told the BBC that the rise in practical test fraud could be due to the length of time it is taking to get a practical test slot.\n\nIn some parts of the UK there are waiting times of up to six months due to a backlog following the Covid pandemic. Some of the fraudsters the BBC spoke to were willing to travel to parts of the UK where waiting times are shorter to take the test for others.\n\nCarly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, said the backlog was causing \"a desperation for test slots\".\n\n\"If you're facing the fact that if you don't pass the test you have to wait for up to six months [to try again], then you're going to think about cheating the system,\" she said.\n\nShe added that some of the instructors in her association had been approached by people running criminal services, asking them to refer pupils struggling to pass their test.\n\nThe high demand for tests has led to operators bulk-buying slots using automated software and reselling them at an inflated price.\n\nThe DVSA says it is actively removing accounts which do this as it breaks the terms and conditions of the booking platform.\n\nThe man, who called himself Erdal, told the reporter he could feed them the answers to the theory test via a Bluetooth earpiece\n\nDuring the investigation, the BBC found a flyer in a London cafe written in Turkish offering a \"100% guarantee\" method to pass the theory test.\n\nOur undercover reporter, posing as someone with little experience of driving, met the man behind the advert, who called himself Erdal.\n\nHe told the reporter he could help them cheat by feeding them the answers to the test's multiple choice questions using a \"microscopic\" Bluetooth earpiece, connected to a mobile phone.\n\nHe told them by clicking on the questions they would be \"read out loud\" by the computer which would allow him to whisper the correct answers.\n\nHe said: \"It's \u00a31,500 and you will pay me right after taking the test. You will be wearing a device in your ear. The test administrators will not look in your ear.\n\n\"We have done this for a long time. We do this for a minimum of two people every day.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, the BBC called the number we had for the man to confront him about the scam. The person that answered had the same name but denied knowing anything about test fraud.\n\nThese scam online adverts can also cause identity fraud problems for the people who have photos of their test pass certificates or driving licence lifted from legitimate sites.\n\nWe spoke to Ian Jones, who had a photo of his driving licence stolen from a logistics company he was registered with. He later discovered it was being used on Instagram by someone advertising a service for \"theory/practical certificate without exams\".\n\nMr Jones says in the past year he has had to dispute hundreds of French speeding and parking tickets he has received because his licence details are being used fraudulently abroad.\n\nHe said: \"It makes you paranoid, it gives you a horrible feeling, it's like being burgled - you feel violated.\"\n\nThe DVSA's head of law enforcement said it had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licenses in 2022\n\nThe Driving Standards Agency, (DVSA), which promotes road safety and sets standards for training, warns many online adverts promising full licences quickly are money-making scams which may only provide a fake licence. It adds only the Driving and Vehicle and Licensing Agency (DVLA) can issue a genuine driving licence.\n\nThe number of people being prosecuted for test fraud via impersonations are increasing, the DVSA says. If convicted, they face prison sentences and fines. Last year, a woman was jailed for eight months for taking approximately 150 theory and practical tests for other drivers.\n\nThe DVSA warns if people do not meet the necessary driving standards before taking control of a vehicle, it could cause serious injuries or even fatalities.\n\nIts head of law enforcement, Marian Kitson, said its investigation team was catching more people committing fraud and had revoked hundreds of illegally-obtained licences in 2022.\n\nIn the year from April 2022, it sent 30 cases - involving 497 offences - of fraud by false representation for prosecution and there were 53 arrests.\n\nHowever, Ms Kitson said it was clear from their investigations that there was even more occurring, adding that they did not know the true scale of the problem.\n\n\"The internet is so huge; the social media platforms are vast and these people are very clever, they move the adverts around; they change them frequently,\" she said.\n\n\"So actually, spotting them and taking action quickly is a real challenge.\"\n\nHave you been affected by the issues in this story?

And more work was needed, which would \"not be possible in time for launch this September\".\n\nKevin Gilmartin, of the ASCL school leaders' union, warned that Year 11 students who had planned to study the delayed T-levels \"may now have missed the opportunity to apply for alternative courses and this will be a real distraction just months before they sit their GCSEs\".\n\nHe added that the DfE's timescale for broader changes to 16-19 qualifications by 2025 - which includes approving funding for Level 3 qualifications other than A-levels and T-levels - was \"simply unworkable\".\n\nAoC chief executive David Hughes said the DfE was \"right to ensure only T-Levels of high enough quality enter the market\", but added: \"Colleges will be massively disrupted by this announcement happening so late in the year.\n\n\"Colleges already had plans in place for how to deliver these now delayed T-levels, and have been marketing them to potential learners.\n\n\"Alternative arrangements will now need to be made urgently.\"\n\nQualifications that overlap with the delayed T-levels, such as BTecs, were due to have their funding cut from 2025, by which time the T-levels were meant to have been in place for two years.\n\nHowever, Ms Keegan said this time frame would remain the case for the three qualifications being pushed back to 2024, despite the delay to their introduction.\n\nShe said there would be \"at least one year\" between the introduction of a T-level and the removal of funding for overlapping qualifications, and that the implications for qualifications that overlap with the catering T-level - being moved to 2025 - would be announced at a later date.\n\nMr Hughes said that, while T-levels were \"an important addition to the qualification landscape\", they should be completed by two year groups of students before other qualifications were defunded.\n\nJames Kewin, of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it made \"absolutely no sense to press ahead with plans to scrap existing Level 3 qualifications\" in the delayed subject areas.\n\nA total of 18 T-levels will be available from September - and the following new courses will roll out as planned:", "Half of the districts of Paris have been hit by the refuse collectors' strike\n\nThe bins are overflowing in large areas of Paris a week into a strike by waste collectors, with thousands of tonnes of rubbish sitting abandoned on the streets of the French capital.\n\n\"It's dirty, it attracts rats and cockroaches,\" one Parisian complained on French radio.\n\nThe workers are striking over the Macron government's proposals to raise the pension age from 62 to 64.\n\nOther cities including Nantes, Rennes and Le Havre are also affected.\n\nRefuse collectors joined the pension strikes a week ago and the Paris authority says half of the city's districts, which are covered by council workers, have been hit by the action. Three waste treatment sites have been blockaded and a fourth partially closed.\n\nOn Monday, the Paris authority said 5,600 tonnes of waste had yet to be collected.\n\nOne commentator on Europe1 radio described the situation as an all-you-can-eat buffet for the six million rats of Paris, double the human population.\n\nIn the 10 districts covered by private companies the service was running almost normally, Paris council said. Some reports indicated activists were trying to prevent collections from going ahead.\n\nAnd one private company was also seen on Monday night by news channel BFMTV picking up waste in one of the big central districts, the sixth, which is normally covered by council workers. Similar bin collections were going on in two other districts on the western fringe of the city.\n\nLeading council official Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire said the situation was complicated but the authority was prioritising intervention for public safety, with a focus on clearing food markets, bin bags lying on the ground and ensuring pedestrian safety.\n\n\"The strike triggers a change in rat behaviour,\" specialist Romain Lasseur told Le Parisien newspaper. \"They'll rummage around in bins, reproduce there, and leave their urine and droppings. We have a worrying health risk for refuse collectors and the general population.\"\n\nParisians are concerned that the strike will lead to the spread of rat-borne disease\n\nThe capital's bin workers are due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue their action. Refuse collectors currently retire at the age of 57 because of difficult working conditions and under the reforms they would have to work for two more years.\n\nOpponents of the Socialist mayor of Paris have seized on the strike as only adding to an existing crisis.\n\n\"Anne Hidalgo promised to double the clean-up budget and Parisians clearly see Paris becoming dirtier and dirtier,\" complained Rachida Dati who runs the seventh district for the right-wing Republicans.\n\nFrance's unions have stepped up action against the government's unpopular retirement reforms which are currently going through parliament.\n\nSeveral operators at French refineries were on strike on Tuesday for a seventh day in a row, but only a small proportion of French petrol stations have had to close.\n\nThe measures were backed by the upper house or Senate on Saturday and will next go to a joint committee of MPs from both houses on Wednesday to decide on the final text. A final vote could reach the National Assembly and Senate on Thursday.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron's party lacks a majority in the lower house so victory on the bill is by no means secure.\n\nThe government needs 287 votes, and even if it can persuade all its 250 MPs to back the reforms it will still need to find another 37 lawmakers from other parties to back the higher pension age.\n\nMany of those extra votes are likely to be Republicans and the government is keen to avoid forcing through the legislation without a vote, which it could do by triggering a 49:3 article of the constitution.\n\u2022 None French plan to raise pension age by two years to 64", "Mohammed Tamimi is the youngest Palestinian killed in the conflict this year\n\nA two-year-old Palestinian boy has died four days after being shot in the head by Israeli forces.\n\nMohammed Tamimi and his father were shot while leaving their home in Nabi Saleh, in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israel military said its soldiers opened fire while in pursuit of two gunmen who had earlier shot at a nearby Jewish settlement.\n\nIn a statement after the incident, the military added that it regretted harm to \"non-combatants\".\n\nPalestinian activist and journalist Bilal Tamimi - who was also injured - said that the Israeli army was waiting to ambush a car at the entrance to Nabi Saleh and opened fire as it approached.\n\nThe toddler was taken by an Israeli military helicopter to Safra Children's Hospital in Israel to be treated for head injuries, but did not recover.\n\nHis father, Haitham, has now been discharged from a Palestinian hospital. It is understood he was able to visit his son in Israel before he died.\n\nThe Israeli military, which has a post just outside Nabi Saleh, previously released grainy video which apparently shows two figures shooting guns. It said the shooting towards the settlement of Halamish - also known as Neveh Tzuf - lasted \"several minutes\".\n\nIt said that its soldiers responded with live fire, causing two Palestinians to be injured.\n\n\"The [Israeli military] regrets harm to non-combatants and is committed to doing everything in its power to prevent such incidents. The incident is under review,\" it stated.\n\nThe settlement of Halamish was set up in the 1970s and has long been a source of friction with Palestinian villagers living close by.\n\nFor several years, Friday demonstrations took place in Nabi Saleh, with local activists protesting against the confiscation of the village's lands and the takeover of its spring.\n\nThese would often lead to violent confrontations with Israeli soldiers using tear gas and rubber bullets to block their path.\n\nSince the start of the year, some 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The figures include militants as well as civilians.\n\nIn addition, 23 people on the Israeli side have been killed - including two foreigners and a Palestinian worker - in attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians. All were civilians except one off-duty serving soldier and a member of the Israeli security forces.\n\nOn both sides, there are children among the dead. Mohammed Tamimi was the youngest Palestinian to have been killed in the West Bank.\n\nSome 700,000 settlers currently live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Settlements are considered illegal under international law although Israel disputes that.\n\nUpdate 7 June 2023: This story has been updated to say that Mohammed Tamimi was two years old and not three, as official sources initially reported, as well as to clarify that attacks or apparent attacks by Palestinians have killed 23 people this year.", "Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting with Russian war correspondents in Moscow on Tuesday\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claims that Ukraine's counter-offensive has been unsuccessful, with its army suffering major losses.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of war correspondents, he said that Kyiv's losses were approaching a \"catastrophic\" level.\n\nThat has not been verified, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has denied the counter-offensive is failing.\n\n\"There is movement forward,\" he said in his nightly video address.\n\nHe thanked Ukrainian troops for \"every step and every metre of Ukrainian land that is being liberated from Russian evil\".\n\nThis was echoed by Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, who wrote on Telegram there had been \"some successes, we are implementing our plans, moving forward\".\n\nUkraine's military declared on Wednesday that Russian losses in the past 24 hours had included 680 soldiers, eight tanks and an air defence system. Both sides give daily claims about enemy casualties, which are impossible to verify.\n\nKyiv's counter-offensive is in its early stages, and modest gains have been made in the eastern Donetsk and south-eastern Zaporizhzhia regions. Mr Zelensky has also claimed advances in Bakhmut.\n\nBut the situation is not as clear-cut as the triumphant claims of liberation that came from Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nOn Tuesday the BBC was granted access to some of the first settlements in eastern Donetsk where the Ukrainian flag is now flying. Many are deserted, and in some areas Russian forces are pushing back.\n\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg said that while it was still \"early days\", progress was being made in repelling Russian troops.\n\n\"What we do know is that the more land that Ukrainians are able to liberate, the stronger hand they will have at the negotiating table,\" he told US President Joe Biden at a White House meeting.\n\nWithout providing evidence, Mr Putin said the Ukrainians had lost over 160 tanks while Russia had lost 54. He also suggested Ukraine's troop losses were ten times greater than Russia's - insisting Kyiv had not succeeded \"in any of the sectors\".\n\nHis comments were dismissed by a US official, who anonymously told the AP news agency they were \"not accurate\" and warned against taking Moscow's public assessments seriously.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAlthough most of Mr Putin's statements during his meeting with war correspondents were typically self-congratulatory, he did acknowledge that authorities in Moscow could have better anticipated recent cross-border attacks into Russia from Ukraine.\n\nHe said he was considering whether \"to create on Ukrainian territory a kind of sanitary zone at such a distance from which it would be impossible to get our territory\".\n\nMr Putin also suggested that Russia was short of \"high-precision ammunition, communications equipment, aircraft, drones, and so on\" - despite weapon production having increased over the past year.\n\nUkraine has had longstanding concerns about Russia's ability to build weaponry.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Zelensky again called for tougher sanctions to halt the flow of weapon components, some of which he said were being manufactured by Ukraine's partner countries.\n\nHe said that Russia was using such components to build the type of missiles that on Tuesday struck an apartment building and warehouses in Kryvyi Rih, killing 11 people and wounding dozens more.\n\nOn the same day, the US announced it would send a new military aid package to Ukraine worth $325 million.\n\nSeparately, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko suggested his country was receiving nuclear weapons from Russia that were \"three times more powerful\" than the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nHe did not say whether they had already received the weapons or not, but claimed their deployment to Minsk was necessary to deter potential aggression.\n\nEarlier this month, Russia said it would deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil from July - seen as a warning to the West, which was increasing its military support for Ukraine.", "Police officers outside Mr Murrell and Ms Sturgeon's home last April\n\nScotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf has said the SNP would like to see a conclusion to the marathon police inquiry into its funding and finances.\n\nOperation Branchform was launched in July 2021 and on Friday it will be a year since police arrested the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell.\n\nHis wife, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested in June. Both were released without charge.\n\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News he would like the inquiry to be over.\n\nBut he said Police Scotland should take as much time as they need.\n\nAfter his early morning arrest on 5 April, the police spent the day searching the home Mr Murrell shares with Ms Sturgeon in Glasgow.\n\nImages of a police tent in the couple's front garden dominated news bulletins and front pages and sent shockwaves around the country.\n\nPolice insiders said they needed the tent so they could examine potential evidence without being filmed or photographed by the media.\n\nMr Murrell has been married to Nicola Sturgeon since 2010\n\nIts use and the scale of the police operation angered many in the SNP and a year on, with a general election on the way, the protracted inquiry is the cause of growing disquiet among party members.\n\nMr Murrell's arrest 12 months ago was followed by that of the party's former treasurer Colin Beattie, who was also released without charge.\n\nAfterwards she told reporters: \"I respect and fully understand the process that's underway but I am absolutely certain that I have done nothing wrong and that is a position that I will continue to maintain.\"\n\nHumza Yousaf succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as first minister last March\n\nAsked this week if he was frustrated over the length of time being taken by the inquiry, Mr Yousaf replied: \"Well, I think people will realise that all of us in the SNP would like to see a conclusion to Operation Branchform.\n\n\"I think that's stating the obvious but, of course, it's up to Police Scotland to determine how long that takes and for them to have the space and time to investigate thoroughly and I don't intend to interfere in that.\n\n\"It's for Police Scotland to take as much time as they require in order to investigate thoroughly.\"\n\nThe investigation originally centred on \u00a3600,000 which had been raised for a second campaign for independence.\n\nIn July last year, the then chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone shed some light on why it was taking so long.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that inquiries around \"fraud or potential embezzlement or misuse of funds\" take time.\n\nSir Iain said investigators needed to obtain information from banks and other financial institutions, which required judicial warrants.\n\nIn a later interview Sir Iain said the sooner the investigation was concluded, the better for everyone involved.\n\nBut he added the force was duty bound to carry out its work as rigorously as possible.\n\nAnother source with knowledge of the case put it this way: \"It will take as long as it takes.\"\n\nSince her appointment, the new Chief Constable Jo Farrell has refused to discuss the case.\n\nIn a statement, Police Scotland said: \"As the investigation remains ongoing we are unable to comment.\"\n\nFormer SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was also arrested but released without charge\n\nThe next expected step is for the police to send what is called a standard prosecution report to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).\n\nIts lawyers would then decide what action, if any, should be taken.\n\nNo-one is saying when that might happen and the Crown has confirmed that, as yet, no-one has been reported for prosecution.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Senior professional prosecutors from COPFS and an advocate depute are working with police on this ongoing investigation.\n\n\"The duration of any investigation will vary depending on its individual circumstances.\n\n\"As is routine, to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, we do not comment in detail on their conduct.\"\n\nThe senior law officers at the top of the Crown Office are not involved in the process because the case involves

that \"we expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged in this way\".\n\nHis comments came almost a week after seven humanitarian aid

about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\n\nAbout 129 hostages remain unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead.\n\nSince then, 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza, with more than 75,815

months of war in Gaza, the toll on civilians continues to grow - hunger, desperation, loss of life on an awful scale.\"\n\nHe said the UK had been \"straining every sinew\" to get aid into Gaza and that it \"must be flooded in\".

We would eat them with tomato sauce, butter and tea.\"\n\nPeter, who is a food tourism ambassador for Scotland Food and Drink, adds: \"There's a good chance that if your grandparents ate a floury bap with bacon and black pudding, that food tradition has been passed down to your parents and then to you.\n\n\"It is in variety we find a sort of identity as a family; our morning roll order is part of our working-class story.\"\n\nThe loss of Morton's Rolls forced Glasgow corner shops, newsagents, chippies and restaurants to scramble for alternatives from rival producers such as McGhees, which already sells more than three million rolls a week.\n\nScott Marwaha, who owns the Mayfield convenience store in Ruchill, says many of his regulars won't go for anything other than \"a Morton's\" because they've grown up with the taste.\n\nScott Marwaha says some customers went to great lengths to get hold of a Morton's roll\n\nSome, he explains, went to extraordinary lengths to get hold of the roll.\n\n\"One customer regularly bought five or six dozen at a time to take over to his family in Ireland,\" he said.\n\n\"There's also a lady from Dumfries who would call me to ask if I could put some rolls aside when she came to visit her mother.\"\n\nBut Morton's is only part of the story.\n\nThe reality is that for many Scots across the nation, breakfast or lunch just wouldn't be the same without a morning roll, whether it is soft, well-fired (black crust) or crispy.\n\nSome prefer well-fired rolls, which have a black crust\n\nThird-generation baker Andrew Chisholm thinks one reason for its popularity is its versatility.\n\nAndrew, who owns Lanarkshire-based chain Christie the Baker, explains: \"The great thing about a morning roll is that you can put anything in it, sweet or savoury.\n\n\"A lot of people will stack it and will have black pudding, beans, bacon or whatever they want in it.\n\n\"We even sell rolls filled with a Scotch pie. It's popular.\n\n\"My own favourite is a nice bit of Scottish cheddar and strawberry jam. Epic.\"\n\nAndrew also points out that Scots have quite different tastes, according to where they live.\n\n\"The roll we make in North Lanarkshire is typical of what you find in the west of Scotland but if you go east to Edinburgh, you'll probably find it's a bit sweeter and a bit softer - there's a wee bit more fat in it.\n\n\"As you go north into Dundee, you'll probably find a lot more flour on it. Again it will be a bit sweeter, with more fat.\n\n\"If you go all the way up to Aberdeen and the surrounding area, it splits into two products.\n\n\"There's the softie, which they just call a morning roll - and the rowie or buttery, as it would be known locally. It is akin more to somewhere between a Danish pastry and a croissant, but made in a Scottish style.\"\n\nButteries (left) and \"softies\" are popular in the north east of Scotland\n\nDespite recent events at Morton's, there is no sign of the Scots losing their appetite for the morning roll.\n\nScottish Scran, a website that celebrates Scottish food, claims it receives more requests for morning roll recipes than any other type of food.\n\nSonja Bolger, who runs the site with husband Phil, says: \"A lot of people in our Facebook group have either moved away or don't live near a bakery that sells morning rolls, so they want to be able to make them.\"\n\nBaker Andrew perhaps epitomises the passion that many north of the border feel for the Scottish roll.\n\n\"To be doing this job every day and seeing the morning rolls coming out of the oven perfectly shaped, how you want them - thin crust on top, a nice aroma coming from them, and the flour to be perfectly distributed on top every day - there is nothing more satisfying,\" he says.", "The government has revealed how much companies will have to pay to import foods from the EU due to Brexit.\n\nSmall imports of products such as fish, salami, sausage, cheese and yoghurt will be subject to fees of up to \u00a3145 from 30 April, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).\n\nThe Cold Chain Federation said the new charges would hit food prices.\n\nThe government said the fees would pay for \"world-class border facilities\".\n\nThe fee, known as the \"common user charge\", will apply to animal products, plants and plant products entering the UK from the EU through the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel at Folkestone.\n\nIt will be charged per type of good imported - the \"commodity line\" - and capped at \u00a3145 for mixed consignments. Individual products will face charges of up to \u00a329. It will apply to goods deemed low, medium and high risk.\n\nThe Cold Chain Federation's chief executive Phil Pluck said the fee would have to be passed on to \"either the EU importer, the smaller UK retailer, or the UK consumer\".\n\n\"Ultimately, this will increase business costs and food prices and potentially lower choices for the shopper,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the government had \"announced the charges at the last minute, leaving affected businesses little time to revise their commercial arrangements\".\n\nThe fee has been introduced to pay for border inspections and fund new facilities in Kent to protect biosecurity - preventing the import of plant and animal disease.\n\nBut the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) said the policy felt like it was \"constructed on the back of an envelope at best\" and would \"undoubtedly increase costs, potentially reduce consumer choice, and increase the likelihood of empty shelves\".\n\n\"Our sector typically has multiple commodity lines per consignment, meaning, in reality, businesses in our sector will be paying the \u00a3145 maximum charge,\" said James Barnes, the HTA chairman.\n\nHorticultural consignments can include plants, seeds, bulbs and cut flowers, he said.\n\nThe government has delayed implementing the changes five times, partly to give business time to prepare and to reduce disruption to supply chains.\n\nThe new border checks will be phased in gradually over the next 12 months but physical checks have been flagged as starting on 30 April for some time. However, the cost associated with those checks had not been revealed until now.\n\nPrior to Brexit, trade between the EU and the UK was free flowing and frictionless.\n\nBut following the UK's departure from the trading bloc, this changed as a result of the relatively distant approach to EU relations adopted by the UK government.\n\nLabour said British shoppers and businesses were \"rightly worried about prices being driven up again\" and that it had warned about the \"potential for chaos\" from new border checks.\n\nShadow minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said: \"With less than a month before their introduction, we now know what the costs will be.\n\n\"Labour has a plan to reduce costly bureaucracy, through seeking to negotiate a veterinary agreement with the EU to massively reduce the need for checks, helping make food cheaper and our businesses more competitive.\"\n\nIn a statement the government said the flat-rate charge was at the \"bottom end of the range which we consulted with industry on\".\n\nIt said the charge was designed to \"recover the costs of operating our world-class border facilities where essential biosecurity checks will protect our food supply, farmers and environment against costly disease outbreaks entering the UK through the short straits\".\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The charges follow extensive consultation with industry and a cap has been set specifically to help smaller businesses. We are committed to supporting businesses of all sizes and across all sectors as they adapt to new border checks and maintaining the smooth flow of imported goods.\"", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Boris Johnson says he will \u201cfind it very difficult to vote for\u201d the Windsor Framework\n\nBoris Johnson has said he will find it \"very difficult\" to vote for Rishi Sunak's new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.\n\nThe former prime minister said the deal was \"not about the UK taking back control\".\n\nIt is the first time he has commented since Mr Sunak unveiled the Windsor agreement on Monday.\n\nThe deal with the EU aims to fix post-Brexit trade problems in Northern Ireland.\n\nA spokesman for Mr Sunak said the prime minister would \"continue to engage with MPs\", but would not confirm when he had last spoken with Mr Johnson.\n\nThe spokesperson said Mr Sunak's deal remained \"the best deal for the people of Northern Ireland and businesses in Northern Ireland\".\n\nBut in his speech, Mr Johnson said it was \"a version of the solution that was being offered\" to Liz Truss when she served as his foreign secretary last year.\n\nIn a speech in Westminster, the former PM said: \"This is the EU graciously unbending to do what we want in our country not by our laws but by theirs.\n\n\"I'm going to find it very difficult to vote for something like this myself, as I believe we should have done something different.\"\n\nThe deal would act as a \"a drag anchor on divergence\" from the EU, he added.\n\n\"Brexit is nothing if we in this country don't do things differently.\"\n\nMr Johnson called for his controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which the EU argued would breach international law, to be restored if the new deal does not work out.\n\nThe bill was scrapped by Mr Sunak, who told MPs his new deal \"puts beyond all doubt that we've now taken back control\".\n\nMPs are expected to have a vote on Mr Sunak's Windsor framework in the coming weeks.\n\nMr Johnson could decide to abstain, rather than actively voting against it.\n\nHe remains an influential force on the Tory backbenches but it appears the majority of the party's MPs will vote for the new deal.\n\nLabour have also said they will back it, guaranteeing that it will become law.\n\nAsked if he would return to frontline politics, Mr Johnson said it was \"very, very unlikely I will need to do a big in politics again\".\n\nInstead, he said he would focus on writing his memoirs alongside campaigning for Ukraine, Brexit and Levelling Up.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - whose support is crucial restoring the power sharing government in Northern Ireland - have yet to deliver their verdict on the deal.\n\nThe Brexiteer European Research (ERG) group of Tory MPs have hired lawyers to study the text in detail before announcing whether they support the deal.\n\nMr Sunak has previously said the new deal is about \"what is best for people in Northern Ireland\" and not \"personalities\".\n\nHe said the deal \"will make a positive difference for all\" in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe prime minister is willing to clarify any \"misunderstandings\" about how the new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland will work, his official spokesman said.", "The Italian minister is Ms Meloni's brother-in-law and right-hand man\n\nA close government ally of Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has attracted claims of white supremacy for saying Italians are at risk of \"ethnic replacement\".\n\nAgriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida said: \"Italians are having fewer children, so we're replacing them with someone else.\"\n\n\"That's not the way forward,\" he added.\n\nMr Lollobrigida is from the same far-right party as Ms Meloni and he is also her brother-in law.\n\n\"We have to incentivise births. We have to build welfare to allow everyone to work and have a family,\" he said in a speech to a trade union conference.\n\nElly Schlein, the leader of the opposition centre-Left Democratic Party, condemned his remarks on ethnic replacement as \"disgusting\" and said they were reminiscent of the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.\n\n\"The minister's words take us back to the 1930s. They are words that have a flavour of white supremacism,\" she said.\n\nItaly's low birth rate has been a key concern of Italy's right-wing government, which came to power in October 2022.\n\nMs Meloni, who leads the Brothers of Italy party, had campaigned on a platform that included a pledge to help Italians have children. She said on Tuesday that for too long Italy had failed to invest in incentives to boost the birth-rate.\n\nThe birth-rate has come into sharper focus in recent weeks after it was announced that Italy had one of the lowest birth rates in the world, with fewer than 400,000 births in 2022. A significant number of births are also registered to non-native Italians.\n\nThe phrase \"ethnic replacement\" used by Mr Lollobrigida has echoes of the so-called Great Replacement theory, a racist far-right conspiracy theory adopted by white supremacists around the world.\n\nIt claims falsely that there is a secret plan to replace white people through increased immigration and other means.\n\nThe gunman in the killing of 10 black people in a Buffalo grocery store in the US allegedly wrote a document endorsing the theory.\n\nThe man behind the 2019 Christchurch massacre in New Zealand wrote a \"manifesto\" entitled The Great Replacement, and Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik is known to have espoused the theory too.\n\nGiorgia Meloni has not yet commented on Mr Lollobrigida's statement, but she has made similar remarks in the past.\n\nIn 2016, she said \"ethnic replacement\" was underway as \"over 153,000 immigrants, primarily African men, arrived in Italy\".\n\nIn 2019, she accused the then-government of wanting to \"destroy our European and Christian identity with uncontrolled mass migration\".\n\nShe also said NGOs working with refugees ignored \"the starving Venezuelans of Italian origin\" in favour of a plan to \"bring in people different from our identity\".\n\nSince she became prime minister six months ago, Giorgia Meloni has won praise at home and abroad for her moderate stance on a variety of issues - from support to Nato and Ukraine to the Italian budget.\n\nBut critics say recent events show the governing coalition in its true colours.\n\nRecently, the government instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents. MPs are also debating a bill to prosecute couples who go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy.\n\nSenate Speaker Ignazio La Russa came under fire in February for saying he would be disappointed if his son came out as gay.

But they reopened in the years after the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nReacting to the new closure, an Afghan woman speaking anonymously told the BBC: \"The Taliban are taking away the most basic human rights from Afghan women.\n\n\"They are violating women's rights.

They were removed by the diplomat and soldier Lord Elgin in the 19th century and later bought by the British government and placed in the British Museum.\n\nRestitution issues more commonly apply to countries which experienced colonial conflict.\n\nEthiopia wants the British Museum to return ceremonial crosses, weapons, jewellery, sacred altar tablets and other items taken from Maqdala in the north of the country during British military action in 1868.\n\nThe Nigerian Government has also formally asked the museum to return 900 Benin Bronzes.\n\nThese beautiful bronze and brass sculptures were created by specialist guilds working for the royal court of the Oba, or King, in Benin City from the 16th century onwards.

Since then, the British Museum says it has worked to establish a positive and ongoing collaboration with the Asantehene and Ghana's Manhyia Palace Museum, which chronicles Asante culture.\n\nIn recent times Ghana's government has set up a Restitution Committee to look at the return of items taken from the Asante palace which are now in collections around the world.\n\nNana Oforiatta Ayim, who sits on that Committee, told the BBC: \"These objects are largely sacred ones and their return is about more than just restitution. It is also about reparation and repair, for the places they were taken from, but also those who did the taking.\"\n\nShe added that they are looking for a new relationship \"not based on exploitation or oppression, but on equity and mutual respect\".\n\nLast Thursday's discussions at the British Museum are the first ever meeting between the Asantehene and the museum director, Dr Fischer.\n\nBenin Bronzes were taken from the ancient city in Nigeria by the British army\n\nOtumfuo Osei Tutu II requested a loan of items of regalia belonging to his forbears, acknowledging the successful ongoing collaboration with the British Museum.\n\nThere are more than 200 Asante gold objects and other regalia within the British Museum collection which were taken by British troops during the Anglo-Asante wars.\n\nBack in the 19th century, the Asante state was one of few African states that offered serious resistance to European colonisers.\n\nA spokeswoman for the British Museum told the BBC: \"Our Director and Deputy Director were pleased to welcome His Royal Majesty Osei Tutu II to the Museum during his visit to the UK for the Coronation of King Charles III\".\n\nShe added that the museum \"is exploring the possibility of lending items from the collection to mark the 150th anniversary of the end of the third Anglo-Asante war, as well as to support celebrations for the Asantehene's Silver Jubilee next year\".\n\nThe Asantehene visited London last week and met with King Charles before his coronation\n\nThe British Museum has not received a formal return request from Ghana since 1974.\n\nIt loans more than 5,000 objects to institutions around the world every year in its efforts to share its collection globally.\n\nFor some Ghanaians however, loans can never be a long term solution.\n\nOforiatta Ayim, who is also a special adviser to Ghana's Culture Minister, said: \"Loans can be a first step in that they can open up dialogue in the kind of institutions and structures that are slow to change. At the end of the day, objects like the ones taken in 1874 were taken under horrifically violent circumstances\u2026 There needs to be honesty, accountability and action\".\n\nThis Asante gold neck torc was taken by the British in the 19th Century, and is at the British Museum\n\nShe added: the objects' homes are \"undeniably the places they were taken from\" though could be lent back to British institutions in future.\n\nLondon's Horniman Museum returned 72 items in its collection to Nigerian ownership last year.\n\nAt the time, Nick Merriman, the Horniman Museum director, told the BBC there was a \"moral argument\" to return them.

Watch: All sides should be responsible and protect civilians - UK PM\n\nRishi Sunak has urged all sides in Russia to \"be responsible and to protect civilians\", as mercenaries from the Wagner group seize military sites from Russia and Vladimir Putin vows to \"punish\" those involved in the move against his government.\n\nIn the UK, a meeting of the emergency committee, Cobra, was chaired by Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe don't get to hear much about what is said in those meetings, but the government says Mr Cleverly received all the latest information and particular attention was paid to the situation of British nationals still in Russia.\n\nMr Sunak has also spoken to US President Biden, French President Macron and German Chancellor Scholz about the situation.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Sunak suggested the government has been watching the internal threats to Vladimir Putin for some time.\n\nHe told me: \"We have been monitoring for a while the potentially destabilising impacts of Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd he said the situation was \"evolving on the ground as we speak\".\n\nBut he urged calm on all sides, saying: \"The most important thing I'd say is for all parties to be responsible and to protect civilians\", a clear hint that the UK is concerned about how conflict inside Russia's borders could spiral, when for months the focus has naturally been on fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThe prime minister did not repeat a more candid assessment from the Ministry of Defence, which said on its official Twitter feed that \"this represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times\".\n\nBut Mr Sunak did not deny that was the case.\n\nWith so much unclear, it is evident that Number 10 does not yet want to give an official verdict on what is happening.\n\nYet it is clear from the Ministry of Defence's comments that the government sees the action taking place as a potential game changer.\n\nThe situation is volatile and no-one in Westminster would predict with any certainty what will happen next.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's motives are.\n\nNor is it certain how many resources and men Wagner really has at their disposal.\n\nBut one of the questions being asked in Westminster this afternoon is how Ukraine can make the most of what seems like disarray inside Russia to make progress in what is now a long-running conflict.\n\nOur politicians, like the rest of us, are watching events and wondering what on earth is going on, and unable to be sure what will happen next. But they are watching with eager attention.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has had such enormous implications for politicians in the UK, because it has indirectly affected every family, every firm, and every household in the country by driving up the cost of energy.\n\nThat's one of the biggest factors in high inflation the prime minister describes as the \"number one enemy\".\n\nWe talk to the prime minister about that, his plans for the NHS and Boris Johnson in an exclusive interview you can watch on Sunday morning.\n\nBut as events unfold in Russia, remember that the actions of one man, Vladimir Putin, upended so much here.\n\nMoscow may be nearly 2,000 miles away, but what happens in the next few days to stability in Russia matters hugely to our politicians in Westminster, and to us all.", "The scenes at the end of both games on the opening day of the 2023 Women's World Cup told the story.\n\nFans danced in the stands as players shed tears of joy after New Zealand got their Women's World Cup campaign off to a winning start on an emotional and historic night at Eden Park.\n\nFor Australia a few hours later, it felt more like getting the job done as they beat Republic of Ireland through a Steph Catley penalty, the Arsenal player taking the captain's armband after Sam Kerr was dramatically ruled out shortly before kick-off with a calf injury.\n\nTwo 1-0 victories, two different perspectives - with the New Zealand perspective one of \"tears\" and \"goosebumps\".\n\n\"Seeing them have tears in their eyes and enjoying it in front of their family and friends at the end, I will never forget these moments,\" New Zealand boss Jitka Klimkova said after Hannah Wilkinson's winner against Norway.\n\nEven Prime Minister Chris Hipkins joined in the New Zealand celebrations, hours after he addressed the nation following the deadly shooting in Auckland that had cast a shadow over what was supposed to be a day of celebration.\n\n\"He came to the locker room and was very proud for this team,\" added Klimkova, the Czech coach who was appointed in August 2021 and spent the first few months of her reign unable to step foot in New Zealand due to Covid restrictions.\n\nThe Football Ferns had waited a long time for Thursday's big moment.\n\u2022 None Go here for all the latest from the Women's World Cup\n\nThey had failed to win a game at their previous five World Cup appearances and few outside New Zealand gave them much hope against Norway.\n\nIf they defeat World Cup debutants the Philippines on Tuesday then New Zealand can start planning for the knockout rounds for the first time.\n\nIn front of a passionate crowd of 42,137 - a record crowd for a football match in New Zealand - they produced a memorable performance that will live long in the memories of those present.\n\n\"I still have goosebumps and emotions,\" Klimkova said an hour after the final whistle.\n\n\"We have waited for this moment for such a long time. Hearing our fans getting behind us like that, it's an unforgettable moment for me. It's an incredible feeling.\"\n\nExcitement had been building across Auckland as the city prepared to kick off the Women's World Cup, the culmination of years of effort to bring the largest ever standalone women's sporting event to its shores.\n\nThe Football Ferns have been hard to ignore as they stared down from giant billboards, while some of the players' faces were projected onto the city's Sky Tower - a 328-metre tall tourist attraction - on the eve of the tournament.\n\nWilkinson, whose goal earned her country a famous win, spent the last few minutes of the match with her head in her hands, sitting on the bench as Norway threatened a late equaliser.\n\nThe hosts had to endure 10 minutes of stoppage time before they were able to celebrate.\n\n\"There were a lot of doubters because of the [recent] results we had, but we believed - we believed in ourselves this entire game,\" said veteran defender Ali Riley, who is playing at her fifth World Cup.\n\n\"This is what dreams are made of.\"\n\nThere was plenty of emotion at Stadium Australia too as the co-hosts also got off to a winning start, thanks to Catley's coolly taken spot-kick seven minutes after half-time.\n\nThis was more like a pressure valve being released. Catley steamed away to the sidelines in celebration, her nine outfield team-mates trailing after her like a yellow comet tail.\n\nHowever, Australia could never quite shake off the threat of a disciplined Republic side, and the pressure valve was back on by the time keeper Mackenzie Arnold had to make a low sprawling save from Irish captain Katie McCabe in the sixth minute of stoppage time.\n\nNevertheless, three points are the same no matter the fashion of the win. At Euro 2022, England started with a scrappy 1-0 victory over Austria before going all the way to a historic triumph as hosts. Australia will now look to do the same.\n\nHow much of the on-field mission Australia will have to negotiate without captain, all-time top scorer and talisman Kerr remains to be seen.\n\nThe 29-year-old - winner of three successive domestic doubles with Chelsea and twice on the Ballon d'Or podium - was a shock absence from the team as it emerged she had suffered a calf injury in training on Wednesday.\n\nKerr will also miss Australia's second game of the World Cup against Nigeria on 27 July, and Catley indicated the Matildas are preparing to be without their focal point for even longer.\n\n\"We were losing the best player in the world, and for her as a person we were heartbroken,\" Catley said. \"We had to gather ourselves quickly, and use her spirit - that's what it will take for however long she misses.\n\n\"She is our spiritual leader, her role will be massive, whatever it will be.\"\n\nThe big screen at Stadium Australia cut to Kerr barely a minute into the match, and went back to her several times during the game as she looked at various stages of pensiveness.\n\nAustralia must be less reserved for the remainder of their World Cup if they are to reach their goals - while for New Zealand, the expression of joy following an uplifting win could be the beginning of something special.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has defended his \"very difficult decision\" to give Ukraine cluster bombs, which have a record of killing civilians.\n\nThe president said it had taken him \"a while to be convinced to do it\", but he had acted because \"the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\".\n\nBut the UK's PM suggested the country \"discourages\" the use of cluster bombs, while Spain criticised the decision.\n\nWhen asked about his position on the US decision, Rishi Sunak highlighted the UK was one of 123 countries that had signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use.\n\nSpain's Defence Minister Margarita Robles told reporters her country had a \"firm commitment\" that certain weapons and bombs could not be sent to Ukraine.\n\n\"No to cluster bombs and yes to the legitimate defence of Ukraine, which we understand should not be carried out with cluster bombs,\" she said.\n\nBut Germany, which is a signatory of the treaty, said that while it would not provide such weapons to Ukraine it understood the American position.\n\n\"We're certain that our US friends didn't take the decision about supplying such ammunition lightly,\" German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told reporters in Berlin.\n\nMr Biden told CNN in an interview on Friday that he had spoken to allies about the decision, which was announced ahead of a Nato summit in Lithuania next week.\n\nThe US, Ukraine and Russia have not signed up to the convention, and both Moscow and Kyiv have used cluster bombs during the war.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Friday's daily White House briefing that officials \"recognise the cluster munitions create a risk of civilian harm\" from unexploded bombs.\n\nBut he said Ukraine was running out of artillery and needed \"a bridge of supplies\" while the US ramps up domestic production.\n\n\"We will not leave Ukraine defenceless at any point in this conflict period,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's defence minister has given assurances the cluster bombs would not be used in urban areas and only to break through enemy defence lines.\n\nThe munitions have caused controversy over their failure - or dud - rate, meaning unexploded small bombs can linger on the ground for years and indiscriminately detonate later on.\n\nMr Sullivan told reporters the American cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine were far safer than those he said were already being used by Russia in the conflict.\n\nHe told reporters the US ones have a dud rate of less than 2.5%, while Russia's have a dud rate of between 30-40%, he said.\n\nMr Biden's move will bypass US law prohibiting the production, use or transfer of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1%.\n\nEarly on in the war, when the White House was asked about allegations that Russia was using cluster and vacuum bombs, the then-press secretary said it would be a potential \"war crime\" if true.\n\nThere has been a mixed reaction among the US president's Democratic Party, more than a dozen of whom have spoken out against the plan.\n\nHuman rights groups also criticised the decision, with Amnesty International saying cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".\n\nThe US Cluster Munition Coalition, which is part of an international civil society campaign working to eradicate the weapons, said they would cause \"greater suffering, today and for decades to come\".\n\nThe UN human rights office has also been critical, with a representative saying \"the use of such munitions should stop immediately and not be used in any place\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA spokesperson for Russia's defence ministry described the move as an \"act of desperation\" and \"evidence of impotence in the face of the failure of the much publicised Ukrainian 'counteroffensive'.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously accused the US and its allies of fighting an expanding proxy war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US president for \"a timely, broad and much-needed\" military aid package worth $800m (\u00a3626m).\n\nHe tweeted that it would \"bring Ukraine closer to victory over the enemy, and democracy to victory over dictatorship\".\n\nUkraine's counter-offensive, which began last month, is grinding on in the eastern Donetsk and south-eastern Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny said the campaign had been hampered by a lack of adequate firepower, and expressed frustration with the slow deliveries of weapons promised by the West.", "The Bibby Stockholm was pictured leaving Falmouth Harbour on Monday morning\n\nA large accommodation barge that will controversially house hundreds of asylum seekers has arrived in the south coast port of Portland in Dorset.\n\nThe Bibby Stockholm left Falmouth Harbour in Cornwall on Monday and was tugged along England's south coast.\n\nThe vessel will be a temporary home for up to 500 single adult male asylum seekers under Home Office plans to ease the pressure on the asylum system.\n\nBut the vessel's arrival in Dorset is set to be greeted by fresh protests.\n\nResidents in Portland have objected, concerned that the local community was not consulted and fearing the impact on local services like healthcare.\n\nCampaigners have worries about the conditions that people will live under, while others have argued using the barge will not save money.\n\nAt a meeting last week, Dorset councillor Laura Beddow said Portland Port was the wrong place to site the barge and added the council had \"serious concerns\" but had been told legal action was unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe barge will provide basic and functional accommodation and healthcare provision\n\nA spokesperson for Portland Port said: \"On arrival it will be connected to Portland Port's fresh water and mains sewerage network as part of preparations for the arrival of the first group of asylum seekers in the coming weeks,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe barge, which has 222 rooms in total, is contracted to be berthed at Portland for 18 months initially and was being made ready in Falmouth in Cornwall.

Watch: Expelled lawmaker Justin Jones tells the BBC \"world should be shocked\"\n\nThe Tennessee statehouse has expelled two Democratic politicians who led a gun control protest that halted legislative proceedings last week.\n\nIn a rare move, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted 72-25 to expel Justin Jones and 69-26 to remove Justin Pearson.\n\nBut an expulsion vote failed against a third Democratic lawmaker, Gloria Johnson, who also joined the protest.\n\nRepublicans said the trio had brought \"disorder and dishonour to the House\".\n\nCrowds of protesters have attended the State Capitol since a school shooting.\n\nThe 27 March attack at Nashville's Covenant School killed six people, including three children.\n\nThe so-called \"Tennessee Three\" took to the House floor chanting \"no action, no peace\" during a protest on 30 March, which also saw hundreds of pro-gun control demonstrators converge on the statehouse.\n\nMr Jones, 27, and Mr Pearson, 28, used a megaphone and banged on the House lectern as they made rousing speeches and addressed the protesters who crowded around the chamber's public viewing platform.\n\n\"We don't want to be up here, but we have no choice but to find a way... to disrupt business as normal, because business as normal is our children dying,\" Mr Pearson said.\n\nThe chamber's proceedings were brought to a standstill for nearly an hour.\n\nAll three also chanted \"enough is enough\" and \"power to the people\". Political analysists said Ms Johnson may have been spared expulsion because she did not use a megaphone.\n\nHowever she has suggested that Republicans did not expel her because she is white, whereas Mr Jones and Mr Pearson are both black.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, a Democrat, slammed the expulsions as \"shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent\".\n\nMr Jones told BBC News that the move had left 78,000 people in one of the state's most diverse districts without representation.\n\nHe said an \"extreme republican supermajority, almost completely a white caucus\" had expelled the \"two youngest black lawmakers because we stood demanding action on gun violence\".\n\nPolitical analysts said Ms Johnson may have been spared expulsion because she did not use a megaphone, unlike her colleagues\n\nTennessee's House of Representatives consists of 75 Republicans and 23 Democrats.\n\nLawmakers argued for hours about the expulsions on Thursday, which are the first such actions taken without the support of both parties in Tennessee's modern history.\n\nMs Johnson was just one vote short of the required two-thirds majority to expel her, with her supporters in the chamber cheering at the result that she would remain.\n\nThe three lawmakers acknowledged they broke House rules by speaking without being formally recognised, but insisted their actions did not warrant expulsion.\n\nSome Republican members said the Democrats' actions amounted to an insurrection, with House Speaker Cameron Sexton, a Republican, comparing the incident to the Capitol Riots.\n\nAnother Republican legislator, Gino Bulso, said they had \"effectively conducted a mutiny.\"\n\nMr Jones and Mr Pearson - or The Justins, as they have been called by some commentators - could soon return to the House, since expulsion does not disqualify a former representative from running for office again.\n\nA county council also has the power to appoint an interim representative in the case of a vacancy. So the expelled lawmakers could be appointed to fill their empty seats in the interim, then run for re-election and be back in the General Assembly within months, according to The Tennessean newspaper.\n\nExpulsion votes are exceptionally rare. In Tennessee, the House of Representatives has only twice voted to expel members in recent history.

His plans were opposed by his junior coalition partners.\n\nMark Rutte said he would hand his resignation to King Willem-Alexander on Saturday\n\nAsylum applications in the Netherlands jumped by over a third last year to more than 47,000 and government figures said earlier this year that they expected roughly 70,000 applications in 2023.\n\nThis week, Mr Rutte tried to force through a plan which included a cap on the number of relatives of war refugees allowed into the Netherlands at just 200 people per month.\n\nBut junior coalition partners the Christian Union, a pro-family party, and the socially-liberal D66 were strongly opposed.\n\n\"The decision was very difficult for us,\" Mr Rutte told journalists as he announced his cabinet's resignation. The differences in views between the coalition partners were \"irreconcilable\", he added.\n\n\"All parties went to great lengths to find a solution, but the differences on migration are unfortunately impossible to bridge.\"\n\nA media scrum welcomed Mark Rutte as he arrived at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague to meet Dutch King Willem-Alexander\n\nA compromise proposal, known as the \"emergency brake\", which would only trigger the restrictions in the event of an excessively high influx of migrants, was not enough to save the government.\n\n\"The four parties decided that they cannot reach an agreement on migration,\" the Christian Union's spokesman Tim Kuijsten said. \"Therefore they decided to end this government.\"\n\nMr Rutte, 56, is the country's longest serving prime minister and has been in office since 2010.

Stop the violence\" after his first-round win on Monday.\n\nFrance's sports minister said the Serb's actions were \"not appropriate\" and should not happen again.\n\n\"A drama-free Grand Slam, I don't think it can happen for me,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"I guess that drives me, as well.\"\n\nThe phrase Djokovic wrote is in reference to recent tension in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Serbia has never recognised Kosovo's independence.\n\nThere has been violence in the past days following the installation of ethnic Albanian mayors in the north of the country, with police and Nato troops clashing with Serb protesters.\n\nIn his post-match news conference, the 22-time Grand Slam champion attempted to put the controversy behind him.\n\nAsked if he had thought about the negative reaction to his actions, Djokovic said: \"Of course I'm aware that a lot of people would disagree, but it is what it is. It's something that I stand for. So that's all.\"\n\nAfter beating Hungary's Marton Fucsovics in the second round on Wednesday, Djokovic marked the lens - which the winner does after every French Open match - with his signature.\n\nWorld governing body the International Tennis Federation said Djokovic's statement did not violate any rules because the Grand Slam rulebook does not ban political statements.\n\nFrench sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said there needs to be a \"principle of neutrality for the field of play\".\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\n\nOudea-Castera said she made a distinction for messages in support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion, adding that she did not put Kosovo and Ukraine \"on the same level\".\n\nThat includes supporting Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk, who was booed by the crowd after she refused to shake hands with Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus on Sunday.\n\nBelarus is an ally of Russia and allowed troops to use its territory to launch last year's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDjokovic, whose father was born in Kosovo, said earlier in the week he was \"against wars, violence and any kind of conflict\" but that the situation in Kosovo is a \"precedent in international law\".\n\n\"Especially as a son of a man born in Kosovo, I feel the need to give my support to our people and to the entirety of Serbia,\" he said on Monday.\n\n\"Kosovo is our cradle, our stronghold, centre of the most important things for our country. There are many reasons why I wrote that on the camera.\n\n\"Of course it hurts me very much as a Serb to see what is happening in Kosovo and the way our people have been practically expelled from the municipal offices, so the least I could do was this.\"\n\nKosovo Olympic authorities have asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open disciplinary proceedings against Djokovic, accusing him of stirring up political tension.\n\n\"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia\" might seem like an odd statement. After all, Kosovo became independent in 2008 - and its geographical location in the south west meant that, even before then, it was always on the periphery of Serbia.\n\nBut its symbolic significance remains highly important to many Serbs. The 1389 Battle of Kosovo has been mythologised as the crucial event in the forging of Serbian identity. And many of the most important sites of the Serbian Orthodox Church are within modern-day Kosovo.\n\nSerbia is one of scores of countries which refuse to recognise Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. And Serbians with family ties to Kosovo are particularly keen to ensure that Serbia's policy of non-recognition continues.\n\nIt has been a turbulent month for Serbia - with mass shootings and multiple protests - and ethnic-Serbs in Kosovo. By writing his courtside message, the country's sporting icon was showing his support - but in a way which was bound to ruffle feathers.\n\nWith his marker pen scribble, Djokovic neatly illustrated the enduring complexity of the situation.\n\u2022 None Peacekeepers in the middle as Kosovo-Serbia row escalates\n\u2022 None In 2013, Simon Watts spoke to George 'Johnny' Johnson, the last survivor of the Dambusters squadron\n\u2022 None Shake off the cobwebs and give your brain a workout with this 19th-century test\n\u2022 None Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone", "Formula 1 owner Liberty Media has bought MotoGP in a deal valued at \u00a33.6bn.\n\nThe US media conglomerate, which took control of F1 in 2017, has purchased the motorbike series from Spanish company Dorna Sports, which has owned MotoGP since 1992.\n\nThe deal will see Liberty acquire about 86% of Dorna, with Dorna's management retaining the rest of the business.\n\nIt is expected to be officially completed by the end of the year.\n\nGreg Maffei, Liberty Media president and chief executive officer, said the company was \"thrilled\" to be expanding its live sports portfolio.\n\nHe added: \"MotoGP is a global league with a loyal, enthusiastic fan base, captivating racing and a highly cash flow generative financial profile.\n\n\"The business has significant upside, and we intend to grow the sport for MotoGP fans, teams, commercial partners and our shareholders.\"\n\nDorna chief executive officer Carmelo Ezpeleta said Liberty has an \"incredible track record in developing sports assets\".\n\n\"We are proud of the global sport we've grown, and this transaction is a testament to the value of the sport today and its growth potential,\" Ezpeleta added.\n\nThe first MotoGP season took place in 1949 with just six rounds of racing but has now grown into 20-grands prix campaign, covering five continents.\n\nSpanish rider Jorge Martin is top of this year's championship on 60 points followed by Brad Binder of South Africa on 42 points.", "Millions of pounds have been paid out in the last ten years to people who were abused in the Scouts, lawyers say.\n\nBBC File on 4 contacted 13 law firms who specialise in child abuse claims, and data from the eight that responded revealed more than \u00a36m had been paid out in compensation in the last decade.\n\nSome 166 cases were settled over the same time, while more female survivors were now coming forward, lawyers said.\n\nThe Scout Association said it was \"deeply sorry\" anyone suffered abuse.\n\nIt comes as two women, who both say they were abused in the Scouts, have started a campaign asking the organisation to change its safeguarding policy.\n\nFile on 4 contacted 13 firms who specialise in abuse claims, all in the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers.\n\nAccording to data from the lawyers who responded, at least 260 claims were taken on against the Scouts in the last ten years, and 166 cases were settled. Some 50 had been unsuccessful and others were still ongoing.\n\nThe BBC asked the Scouts how much money it had paid out in the last ten years.\n\nThe association said it had not been able to get to a definitive number because much of the information related to historical cases and was spread across numerous insurers - but the number of payouts broadly matched what they were aware of.\n\nAccording to the association, 96% of claims related to offences that happened prior to 2013 - with many from the 1960s to 1990s.

She says he noticed she was having an unhappy time at home and offered to let her stay at his house one night a week after Scouts. It was there, she says, he sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions.\n\nLucy was also 13 when she says she was groomed by a young leader. He bought her necklaces and he would often arrange to meet her before Scouts.\n\nIt was at one of these meetings that Lucy says she was forced to have sex with him. She says the sexual abuse continued for nine months in the grounds where the Scout meetings took place and on camps.\n\nLucy says other adult volunteers were aware of what was going on but failed to report the abuse. She subsequently sued the Scout Association for failing in their duty of care. It didn't accept liability but settled out of court, paying Lucy \u00a3160,000.\n\nSheanna and Lucy have now set up a petition asking the Scouts to change their safeguarding policies.\n\nThey want a paid safeguarding lead officer in every Scout county in the UK, who would be responsible for monitoring the conduct of volunteers and ensuring allegations of abuse are properly reported.

He is super important for us, a wonderful player and a wonderful boy - I'm really happy for Liverpool that we got him.\n\n\"His defensive work has been really good where people were doubting if he could be defensive, but I prefer him in the eight [attacking midfield].\n\n\"He is a really good player.

Then he scores this kind of goal, the two biggest screamers of the season [after also scoring from long distance against Fulham] have come from him. Then the free-kick directly after [the goal] - absolutely insane, what a player.\"\n\nMac Allister, who joined Liverpool for \u00a335m from Brighton last summer, also hit the crossbar with a curling free-kick.\n\nLiverpool were gifted a 17th-minute lead when Darwin Nunez charged down goalkeeper Ivo Grbic's clearance with the ball rebounding into the net.\n\nDespite having 84% of possession in the first half and wasting numerous chances, the hosts conceded a 58th-minute equaliser as Gustavo Hamer's header bounced off Conor Bradley and into his own net.\n\nBut Mac Allister - nominated for March's Premier League Player of the Month award - put the hosts back in front with 14 minutes left, before substitute Gakpo's header sealed a vital success.\n\nThe result moved the Reds two points clear of Arsenal and three ahead of reigning champions Manchester City, with eight league games left.\n\nMore importantly, it also kept Liverpool's title destiny in their own hands.\n\nThey know if they beat Manchester United, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Everton, West Ham, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Wolves, it will secure their second Premier League title and confirm them as top-flight English champions for a 20th time.\n\u2022 None Liverpool v Sheffield United as it happened, plus reaction and analysis\n\nThe visitors were looking to win at Anfield for the first time since Jostein Flo scored twice in a 2-1 win on 2 April, 1994, while Liverpool had not lost a home league match in 27 games - a 2-1 reverse against Leeds in October 2022.\n\nBut Sheffield United nearly made a dream start, only for home goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to make an excellent save to deny James McAtee in the opening 90 seconds. Striker Ben Brereton Diaz was then unable to convert Auston Trusty's flick-on from the resulting corner.\n\nHowever, the visitors gifted the Reds an early goal with Grbic's clearance charged down by Nunez, who scored his 18th club goal of the season in all competitions.\n\nThe only mystery was how it was only 1-0 at half-time. Mohamed Salah twice missed the target when well placed, Nunez headed wide and shot at Grbic and Joe Gomez - still without a Liverpool goal - curled an effort past the post.\n\nRyan Gravenberch slipped when taking a shot after great skill from Luis Diaz and Dominik Szoboszlai fired just off target and forced a good stop from Grbic.

He died there two days later.\n\nA coroner's report would find that toxic salt levels caused by the excessive consumption of fish oil was a leading cause in his death.\n\nMore than four years on, 18 students have been sentenced to up to 300 hours of community service and a \u20ac400 ($430; \u00a3340) fine each after being found guilty in their role in Mr Dia's involuntary death and degrading treatment.\n\nThey have also been ordered to pay damages to Mr Dia's family, as well as to two others who were also subjected to the hazing initiation.\n\nThe court ruled that the students - members of the now-disbanded Reuzegom, whose members were traditionally associated with some of Belgian society's elites - were not guilty of intentionally administering harmful substance causing death or illness.\n\nHowever suggestions that race and class played a part in the treatment Mr Dia was subjected to during the hazing have sparked discussion since his death - particularly among young people on social media and in student circles.\n\nAllegations of racism within the Reuzegom fraternity appeared in Belgian media, including that Mr Dia was subjected to a racial slur and singled out to clean on behalf of Reuzegom members on a separate occasion because of his race.\n\nOther local media reports have claimed some of Reuzegom's members were the sons of politicians and judges - pointing to their privileged positions in society.\n\nWith this in mind, some Belgians have reacted to the verdict with indignation, viewing the sentencings as overly lenient.\n\nA silent protest was held in front of Antwerp's court of appeal on 27 May\n\nOn TikTok, the hashtag #justiceforsanda has gained more than 6.5m views.\n\nProtests have also taken place in the cities of Antwerp, Brussels, Gent and Leuven - the university city where Mr Dia studied.

The students have not divulged who was responsible for administering it.\n\n\"It's just very painful not to know those things when those 18 Reuzegom defendants know it all,\" Mr De Vel said.\n\nSven Mary, the lawyer representing Mr Dia's father, Ousmane Dia, said after the court verdict it was \"difficult\" for the family not to know the full facts.

That was met with surprise by analysts who had expected it to fall.\n\nThe shock figure was driven by higher prices for flights and second-hand cars but supermarket food prices also continued to rise rapidly.\n\nSo-called \"core\" inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as direct energy and food prices, along with alcohol and tobacco prices, continued to rise last month at its fastest rate for 31 years.\n\nEconomists said this made the UK stand out from other countries such as the US and Germany where inflation is falling.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt appeared to back further interest rate rises saying it would not \"hesitate in our resolve to support the Bank of England as it seeks to squeeze inflation out of our economy\".\n\nThe government's target is to halve the inflation rate to 5% by the end of the year. The official, long-term target set for the Bank is 2%.\n\nRob Morgan, from investment firm Charles Stanley, said: \"Getting the inflation genie back into the bottle is proving troublesome for the Bank of England.\n\n\"With price momentum continually running above expectations alongside strong wages data, the Bank has no choice but to continue on a path of raising interest rates several more times.\"\n\nWhen interest rates rise, a range of loans can get more expensive. More than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate mortgage deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments.\n\nThe increase in the Bank rate to 4.75% from 4.5% would mean those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a324 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a315 jump.\n\nThis comes on top of increases following the previous recent rate rises. Compared with pre-December 2021, average tracker mortgage customers would be paying about \u00a3441 more a month, and variable rate mortgage holders about \u00a3282 more.\n\nIf the rate goes up to 5%, those on a typical tracker mortgage would pay about \u00a347 more a month. Those on standard variable rate mortgages would face a \u00a330 jump.\n\nEight out of 10 mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage.

But official footage, shared by the government and uploaded on to social media, confirmed her suspicions. Painstakingly scrolling through it, frame by frame, she spotted him 25 minutes into the footage, shaking hands with his cellmate. She pressed pause, rewound, and examined the footage again. Though his head was shaved, and he was wearing nothing except regulation white shorts, she had no doubt that this person was Darwin, whom she had not seen since his arrest 11 months previously. This was her first evidence that he had been transferred to El Salvador\u2019s notorious mega-jail, Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (Cecot), which was opened in January by the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, in Tecoluca, 74km (46 miles) south-east of the capital San Salvador. Cecot has become a symbol of President Bukele\u2019s notorious \"war against gangs\", which the country\u2019s ministry of security says has resulted in the detention of at least 68,000 people since the campaign began in March 2022. There are thousands of Salvadorans who have not heard from their detained relatives for months, and who, like Angelica, look for them in videos, photographs, or - in the case of those whose loved ones are in lower security jails - by peeking through small holes in prison walls. But President Bukele\u2019s state of emergency, in a country which had become one of the most violent in the world, is very popular domestically. In a CID Gallup poll of 1,200 citizens in January, 92% of those polled said they had a \"favourable opinion\" of their leader. His approval is largely fuelled by the drastic drop in recorded murders since his administration took office. Many Salvadorans stress this change, especially in neighbourhoods previously controlled by gangs which sought to intimidate the local population with the motto: \"See, hear, shut up\". Now residents can cross gang borders without harassment or fear of retaliation. El Salvador\u2019s government says Cecot can hold up to 40,000 prisoners who will exclusively be high-ranking members of two rival gangs - Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 - whose warfare led to decades of terror and bloodshed in El Salvador. The BBC has been repeatedly denied access to Cecot, but has recreated details of the jail using videos and photos shared by the government, and media outlets who were given access to the prison before it opened; interviews with Salvadoran officials; and documents shared with us by an engineer - on condition of anonymity - who was involved in the prison\u2019s construction.\n\nAt its capacity of 40,000 prisoners each cell can house 156 prisoners if no new blocks are built. The bunks are simply a metal plate with no mattress. The ceiling is a diamond shaped mesh - the holes allow guards to keep an eye on the prisoners, and the lattice is made of sharpened metal to prevent prisoners hanging from it. Each cell has two basins for prisoners to wash their clothes and themselves and two toilets which lack any privacy. There are no windows, fans or air conditioners despite warm temperatures and high humidity all year round. The authorities say prisoners will only leave their cells for online hearings or solitary confinement.\n\nThe space that each prisoner will have in their shared cell remains one of the big unknowns. Plans seen by BBC Mundo indicate each cell is 7.4m x 12.3m, or 91.02sq m - at capacity this would give each person 0.58sq m of space. The Red Cross recommends 3.4sq m per prisoner in a shared cell as an international standard. El Salvador\u2019s authorities have stated that they do not expect Cecot\u2019s prisoners to ever be released.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how many prisoners are currently being held in Cecot. The authorities have only publicly announced two transfers so far - each of 2,000 inmates. There is no outside recreational space, and no family visits allowed, the authorities say. This contravenes international guidelines on prisoner rights. The criteria for incarceration in Cecot has not been made public, and it is not clear whether prisoners have been newly detained or transferred from other jails. Little is known about how inmates are fed or looked after. No plans or photos have been shared of kitchen, dining room, shop or infirmary facilities. The authorities say Cecot has state of the art security - entry scanning systems, a vast surveillance network, and a well-equipped weapons room.\n\nThe prison \"is a concrete and steel pit where there is a perverse calculation to dispose of people without formally applying the death penalty\", Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, told the BBC. Antonio Dur\u00e1n, a senior judge in the city of Zacatecoluca, and one of the few magistrates openly critical of President Bukele\u2019s emergency regime, agrees. \"In a state operating under the rule of law, the deprivation of liberty is the punishment. The offender is punished by depriving him of his freedom,\" he says. \"But here it is understood that he is deprived of liberty to be punished inside the prison. And that is not only wrong but also criminal. It's torture.\" Cecot is seen by El Salvador\u2019s government as the end of the line for its inmates. \"We have a commitment with the Salvadorans that (Cecot prisoners) will never return to the communities. And we are going to ensure we build the necessary cases (against them) to make sure they never return,\" Minister of Justice and Public Security Gustavo Villatoro told the BBC\u2019s Will Grant in May. \"For us, Cecot represents the biggest monument to justice we have ever built. We don\u2019t have anything to hide,\" he added. A comment from President Bukele in May seemed to double down on this commitment. \"Let all the 'human rights' NGOs know that we are going to wipe out these bloody murderers and their collaborators, we will put them in prison and they will never get out,\" he tweeted. It is not known how many - if any - of Cecot\u2019s inmates have yet been formally convicted of the crimes they are accused of. The BBC asked El Salvador\u2019s government to give details of who is in the jail and on what basis, how it will accommodate 40,0000 people, and why prisoners\u2019 relatives have not been given confirmation of their transfer, but did not receive any response. A few weeks ago, the BBC got as close as it could to the jail. \"Not even El Chapo could escape from there,\" a police officer stationed in the area told us, referring to the notorious jailed Mexican drugs lord, who has previously mounted several improbable prison escapes.\n\nThe prison complex is about 23 hectares (57 acres). It has eight blocks with 32 cells each. The are two sets of mesh perimeter fences which are fully electrified, and two reinforced concrete walls surround the facilities. The perimeter of the outer wall is 2.1km (1.3 miles). And there are 19 watchtowers.\n\nThe policeman admitted that his life had improved considerably in recent months. \"Before, my time was spent extricating gang members from their homes, with all the risk that that suggests. Now I spend the day at checkpoints, and occasionally even have time for a coffee.\" Residents of neighbourhoods previously controlled by the gangs seem particularly supportive of President Bukele\u2019s policy. \"This place was not safe at all until the president did that,\" Dennise, who lives in La Campanera, on the outskirts of San Salvador, told the BBC. \"I think the (emergency) regime was the best decision that could have been made and that this is the best president we have ever had.\" Her mood contrasts with that of Maria, 23, whom we meet not far from Cecot, in her house in El Maniadero. Her mother\u2019s partner worked for six months on the construction of the prison, before being arrested himself for \"unlawful association\". Maria no longer risks going out much, she says. Her friend Jessica - mother to a three-year-old girl - has also been taken away by the police under the emergency regime. \"It seems that being young is now a crime in El Salvador,\" Maria says. \"We will put them in prison and they will never get out\" - President Bukele The BBC spoke to dozens of relatives of prisoners detained under the so-called \"state of exception\" regime, who all gave a similar account. They said their loved ones were taken from their homes - without being shown a search or arrest warrant - to detention centres or jails, and then subjected to group online hearings along with dozens of other detainees. In those hearings the judge would order a pre-trial detention, while the prosecutor's office investigated whether there was evidence for a formal charge - a process that can last for months, even years. A report in May by Cristosal, El Salvador\u2019s primary human rights NGO, concluded that in the first year of these measures, dozens of inmates died from torture, beatings or lack of healthcare in the country\u2019s other prisons. The government has not publicly responded to the report. But the country\u2019s human rights commissioner Andr\u00e9s Guzm\u00e1n Caballero, who took office on 24 May, conceded during a media event that month that the report was \"worrying\". \"When the prison population is made up of two or three gangs, or three groups, that have clashed a lot with each other, it can have consequences such as increased deaths - the causes must be reviewed on a case by case basis,\" he said. Cecot, Cristosal says, is a particular worry because it is so difficult to monitor. \"Conditions at Cecot might become inhumane and degrading because no-one has access to that prison,\" says Zaira Navas, El Salvador\u2019s former police inspector general who is now Cristosal\u2019s legal lead. \"No lawyers, no ombudsman, not even the media can enter and verify the conditions inside.\" As for Angelica, who had spotted her husband in the Cecot footage, she told us that she was now planning to get any information she could about his situation. \"There is no other way but to keep ploughing on\u2026 my children and husband need me to do that.\"", "This was a presidential visit which required delicate diplomacy.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's task was to sum up the achievements of the 25 years since the Good Friday peace deal against a backdrop of all-too-frequent political instability in Belfast.\n\nHe said the return of the power-sharing devolved government at Stormont was \"critical\" for Northern Ireland.\n\nBut he followed that up by adding: \"That's a decision for you to make, not for me to make.\"\n\nThe remark was simultaneously challenging and sensitive.\n\nThe White House will have been aware that a tone which could have been interpreted as overbearing would have fuelled unionist hostility towards a president who they have often criticised in the past.\n\nBut Mr Biden's visit seems to have gone down reasonably well with the leader of unionism.\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson says the president made it clear that he had no come to Belfast to interfere\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said the president had made clear he hadn't come to \"interfere\" and that Mr Biden had \"recognised the need to bring balance to what he had to say\".\n\nThe DUP is vetoing the formation of a governing coalition at Stormont -

more stability would bring in more dollars.\n\nThe industries he mentioned are already bright spots in the Northern Ireland economy - cybersecurity, life sciences, green energy.\n\nAnd the biggest round of applause during the speech came when the president pointed out Northern Ireland actor James Martin, who was recently on stage at the Academy Awards when the short film he starred in won an Oscar.\n\nIt was a way of highlighting Northern Ireland's global reputation as a hub for TV and film production.\n\nThe projects which have been based here have included Game of Thrones -

When it is public, I will talk about it.\"\n\nBut the relationship between Ukraine and the Vatican has sometimes been uneasy.\n\nA few months after the war in Ukraine began, the Pope said in an interview that Moscow's invasion was \"perhaps somehow provoked\".\n\nAnd last August, Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican took the unusual step of criticising the Pope after the pontiff referred to Darya Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultra-nationalist figure, who was killed by a car bomb, as an \"innocent\" victim of war.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, President Zelensky had talks with his counterpart Sergio President Mattarella and then met Ms Meloni for a working lunch.\n\nSilvio Berlusconi, leader of the conservative Forza Italia party, is an old friend of President Putin. They went on trips together and exchanged birthday gifts.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister, has frequently voiced pro-Russian sentiments and criticised military assistance to Ukraine. President Zelensky is not expected to meet either Mr Salvini or Mr Berlusconi during his trip.\n\nAt the news conference that followed the meeting between Mr Zelensky and Ms Meloni, the Ukrainian leader invited \"all the Italian political leaders and representatives of civil society\" to visit Ukraine.\n\nHe said they would be able \"to see what a single person was capable of doing to us, what Putin was capable of, and you will understand why we are fighting this evil\".\n\nMs Meloni stressed that the war would only end when Russia stopped its \"brutal and unjust aggression\" and withdrew from all Ukrainian territory.\n\nShe also pledged Italy's support for Ukraine for \"as long as is necessary\".\n\nMeanwhile, the German government unveiled its biggest military aid package for Ukraine yet, worth \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.4bn). Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelensky, said the aid indicated that Russia was \"bound to lose and sit on the bench of historical shame\".\n\nEarlier this week, German media reported that President Zelensky was planning to visit Germany following his trip to Italy, although this has not yet been confirmed.", "Alexander Lukashenko gave his own version of how the mutiny came to an end on Saturday\n\nThe leader of Russia's 24-hour mutiny, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has arrived in Belarus, three days after his Wagner mercenary group's mutiny came to an end 200km (125 miles) south of Moscow.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, he's in Belarus today,\" leader Alexander Lukashenko announced, claiming credit in arranging his exile.\n\nPrigozhin's whereabouts had been a mystery since he was filmed driving off in southern Russia on Saturday night.\n\nHis private jet was tracked flying into the Belarus capital Minsk on Tuesday.\n\nMr Lukashenko said Wagner mercenaries had been offered an abandoned military base if they wanted to join their leader: \"There is a fence, everything is available, erect your tents.\"\n\nUnder the deal that brought an end to the mutiny, Prigozhin has been promised security and the Russian criminal case against Wagner has been dropped.\n\nMoscow is preparing to transfer the mercenaries' heavy weapons into the regular military and the fighters have been told they can either sign regular army contracts, go home or head to Belarus.\n\nNato members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania have warned that Wagner's arrival in Belarus could spell trouble for them as neighbours. A Lithuanian presidential adviser said the mercenaries were dangerous as they could take part in sabotage and infiltration operations.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told a press conference that if Wagner were to deploy its \"serial killers\" in Belarus, then neighbouring countries would face \"even greater danger of instability\".\n\nNato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ready to defend itself against any threat from \"Moscow or Minsk\" and would agree to strengthen its defences at a meeting in Lithuania next week - focusing particularly on nations bordering Belarus.\n\n\"We have sent a clear message to Moscow and to Minsk that Nato is there to protect every ally and every inch of Nato territory,\" he said.\n\nRussia moved tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus in recent weeks, with President Putin saying they would only be used if Russian territory was threatened.\n\nBelarusian public opinion is also very disturbed, according to Katia Glod of the European Leadership Network. \"Obviously they don't want to have a criminal like Prigozhin in Belarus,\" she said.\n\nMr Lukashenko said merely that the Wagnerites could help the Belarusian military, sharing their experience with tactics and weapons.\n\nThe mutineers' ease in seizing control of the city of Rostov-on-Don and then driving so far north with little opposition has exposed major weaknesses in the Kremlin's control of security in Russia after 23 years of Putin rule.\n\nWagner fighters were able to take control of Rostov without a shot being fired\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected as \"hysteria\" suggestions that the events of Friday and Saturday had dented his hold on power.\n\nBut then President Putin himself told an array of Russian security forces assembled in a Kremlin square that they had defended their motherland, \"de facto stopping a civil war in its tracks\".\n\nThe insurrection was even more alarming as Mr Putin revealed that Prigozhin's private army had been fully funded by the state, with $1bn spent on salaries and bonuses in 12 months. A further $1bn went to Prigozhin's Concord catering firm for feeding the military.\n\nThe Russian leader admitted that pilots had lost their lives \"confronting the mutineers\" in the latest attempt to take hold of the narrative of a turbulent few days that shook the Kremlin.\n\nSix military helicopters and an Ilyushin 22-M command-and-control plane were shot down by the mutineers, according to unconfirmed reports. Some wreckage has been seen but the number of casualties is unclear.\n\nPrigozhin also accused the Russian military of a missile strike on his men on Friday, killing 30 people. However, no evidence of that has been seen.\n\n\"In a day we covered 780 km,\" he said on Monday. \"Not a single soldier was killed on the ground. We are sorry that we had to strike aircraft, but they were hitting us with bombs and missiles.\"\n\nVideos have shown the Wagner convoy being bombed from the air as they headed north among civilian traffic in the southern Voronezh region on Saturday.\n\nWhatever the truth of how 24 hours of mayhem did come to an end, one elaborate version was presented on Tuesday by Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is widely thought to have rigged 2020 elections to maintain power.\n\n\"I said to Putin: We could waste [Prigozhin], no problem. If not on the first try, then on the second. I told him: don't do this,\" he told security officials.\n\nHe said he had offered to phone Prigozhin, to which Mr Putin reportedly said: \"Look, Sasha [Alexander], it's useless, he won't even pick up the phone and doesn't want to speak to anyone.\"\n\n\"Give me his number,\" he went on. \"[Putin] said, 'most probably, the FSB [Russian Federal Security Service] have his number'.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The day Wagner chief went rogue... in 96 seconds\n\nDescribing his conversation with Prigozhin, Mr Lukashenko said the mercenary boss was in a state of euphoria because of Wagner's success until that point.\n\nAccording to the Belarusian leader, Prigozhin told him: \"We want justice, they want to strangle us, we will go to Moscow.\"\n\n\"I tell him that half way you will be crushed like a bug.\"\n\nRussia academic Mark Galeotti said the Belarus leader had acted as a useful intermediary for President Putin, who could now seek to keep Mr Prigozhin on side to manage his mercenary forces in Africa.\n\nKatia Glod said that Belarusians were focused on how far the crisis had weakened Vladimir Putin, as it would also mean a weakened Alexander Lukashenko.\n\n\"The twin pillars of Lukashenko are the Kremlin and the violence of [Belarus] security services that fulfil Lukashenko's orders,\" she said. \"In the short term it could mean more repression as Lukashenko feels more weakened. If the Kremlin looks less reliable as a pillar it could mean good news in the long term.\"", "Scotland Yard has faced questions over its plans to reform\n\nPolice tactics used against terrorists are being used to catch the 100 worst predators targeting women in London.\n\nThe Met said a system assessing 35,000 offenders reported each year for crimes against females was being used.\n\nThe Cambridge Crime Harm Index is the first system to measure the seriousness of crime harm to victims, rather than just the number of recorded crimes.\n\nPreviously used for only terrorism and organised crime, it is the first time it has been used for attacks on women.\n\nThe system gathers data on tens of thousands of men recently convicted of domestic assault, rape, sex offences, stalking, and harassment to rank the 100 who pose the highest risk to the public.\n\nIt follows a series of scandals and a review that found the force was racist, misogynist and homophobic.\n\nPlans to overhaul the force, a \u00a3366m two-year scheme dubbed A New Met for London, are being launched with visits to every borough in the capital.\n\nBosses say there will be an increased emphasis on neighbourhood policing in a bid to rebuild public trust.\n\nSome 240 officers out of the Met's total workforce of around 34,000 will be moved from central to local teams.\n\nSir Mark Rowley says he is committed to rooting out rogue officers\n\nThere are also plans to recruit 500 more community support officers (PCSOs) and an extra 565 people to work with teams investigating domestic abuse, sexual offences and child sexual abuse and exploitation.\n\nEach borough will have at least one front counter open 24 hours a day under the proposals.\n\nDuring austerity from 2010 onwards, local borough teams were cut so that between two and four boroughs were covered by one basic command unit.\n\nMet Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday: \"We're being much more proactive going after the repeat offenders.\n\n\"We've been doing this for a year or two with stalking and harassment, which is important because it's often a precursor to serious violence or even domestic murder.\n\n\"We've increased the prosecution rate on those offences. We're getting more preventative orders against offenders.\n\n\"We're seeing early signs of the domestic violence murder rate going down in London.\"\n\nHe added that the force was seeing more come forward to report crimes against women.\n\nZoe Billingham, who served as HM Inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) for 12 years, told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: \"I am so pleased to hear that the Met Police are undertaking this innovative reform.\n\n\"What it means is that they will target predators, those men that prey on women and girls. It's known from research that a predator won't target one single woman, it's multiple women who are his victims.\n\n\"If the Met Police knows where its most prolific offenders are and is going to use really overt tactics, the same they use to fight terrorism, this is great news.\"\n\nWhy hasn't this been done before? This approach - using data to try to target the most dangerous suspects more precisely - is already used to tackle terrorism and serious organised crime.\n\nBut there've been two significant changes.\n\nThe first is the increase in reports of rape and domestic abuse: police say the numbers are too big to manually identify which cases to prioritise and they need to find new crime-fighting methods.\n\nThe second is about the pressure on the Met to take violence against women and girls more seriously. Campaigners have warned many victims have lost confidence in the force.\n\nThe Met hopes to restore that trust, but that will mean not only bringing more offenders to justice, but also demonstrating a change in its own culture as a force criticised as \"institutionally misogynist\" by Baroness Casey.\n\nBaroness Casey was appointed to review the force's culture and standards after the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by serving police officer Wayne Couzens, in 2021.\n\nDuring the course of her review, another Met officer, David Carrick, was convicted of a series of rapes, sexual offences and torture of women.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \"Londoners will rightly judge this plan on actions not words, and I will be unflinching in holding the Met and the commissioner to account and supporting him to deliver.\"\n\nLondon's victims' commissioner Claire Waxman said: \"A New Met for London clearly sets out how the Met plans to turn around the force and deliver for Londoners, but there is no time to lose, as they need to quickly and effectively improve their support to the thousands of victims they interact with on a daily basis.\"\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

They can be eliminated\n\nIt's got a visible light (the light our eyes sense) instrument, called simply VIS; and an infrared (longer wavelength light than our eyes will sense) instrument referred to as NISP, or Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer.\n\nThe sample pictures from both cameras contain countless stars and galaxies, even though they are tracing a patch on the sky that is smaller than the full Moon.\n\nInterestingly, if you look closely at the VIS imagery, you can see lots of little streaks. These are tracks left by high energy particles, or cosmic rays. They strike the camera's detectors at all angles to leave lines of various lengths.\n\nWhen Euclid commences its 3D survey, scientists will remove these artefacts by stacking several exposures on top of each other.\n\nThe European Space Agency says mission managers had a bit of a scare when they first examined the VIS pictures because it was evident stray sunlight was getting into the camera through some gap in the hardware. By turning the space observatory, they were able to block the contaminating light.\n\nThe issue should not affect Euclid's survey, provided the telescope is only used in specific orientations.\n\nEngineers have several more months of commissioning before the telescope can be released to go after its two targets.\n\nDark matter is the matter that cannot be detected directly but which astronomers know to be there because of its gravitational effects on the matter we can see.\n\nGalaxies, for example, could not hold their shape were it not for the presence of some additional \"scaffolding\". This is presumed to be dark matter - whatever that is.\n\nAlthough this material cannot be seen directly, the telescope can plot its distribution by looking for the subtle way its mass distorts the light coming from distant galaxies.\n\nDark energy is a very different concept from dark matter.\n\nThis mysterious \"force\" appears to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Recognition of its existence and effect in 1998 earned three scientists a Nobel Prize.\n\nEuclid will investigate the phenomenon by mapping the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies.\n\nThe patterns in the great voids that exist between these objects can be used as a kind of \"yardstick\" to measure the expansion through time.\n\nEuclid won't be able to say definitively \"this is the nature of dark matter and dark energy\", but what it should do is narrow the scope of the models and ideas that flood current thinking. It will focus the attention of theorists and experimentalists.\n\nThe development of the VIS instrument was led from the UK.\n\nArtwork: Euclid has been given six years to assemble its 3D map of one-third of the sky", "White Lotus actor Paolo Camilli was among those expressing their anger that \"a brief grope, if it's under 10 seconds, isn't considered a crime\"\n\nDoes it count as sexual harassment if an assault lasts less than 10 seconds?\n\nMany young people in Italy are expressing outrage on social media, after a judge cleared a school caretaker of groping a teenager, because it did not last long enough.\n\nShe described walking up a staircase to class with a friend, when she felt her trousers fall down, a hand touching her buttocks and grabbing her underwear.\n\n\"Love, you know I was joking,\" the man told her when she turned around.\n\nAfter the incident, which happened in April 2022, the student reported the caretaker, 66-year-old Antonio Avola, to police.\n\nHe admitted to groping the student without consent, but said it was a joke.\n\nA Rome public prosecutor asked for a three-and-a-half year prison sentence but this week the caretaker was acquitted of sexual assault charges. According to the judges, what happened \"does not constitute a crime\" because it lasted less than 10 seconds.\n\nSince the ruling, palpata breve - a brief groping - has become a trend on Instagram and TikTok in Italy, along with the #10secondi hashtag.\n\nItalians have posted videos looking at the camera in silence and touching their intimate parts for 10 seconds straight.\n\nCamilla posted this video referring to the caretaker's acquittal and the quote: \"Groping lasted just 10 seconds\"\n\nThe videos are often uncomfortable to watch but they have the aim of showing just how long 10 seconds can feel.\n\nThe first was posted by White Lotus actor Paolo Camilli, and since then thousands of people have followed suit.\n\nAnother video was reposted by Chiara Ferragni, Italy's most famous influencer who has 29.4 million followers on Instagram.\n\nAnother influencer, Francesco Cicconetti wrote on TikTok: \"Who decides that 10 seconds is not a long time? Who times the seconds, while you're being harassed?\"\n\n\"Men don't have the right to touch women's bodies, not even for a second - let alone 5 or 10.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that the judges' decision to acquit the caretaker shows just how normalised sexual harassment is in Italian society.\n\nA post on the Freeda Instagram account says: \"This sentence is absurd. The duration of the harassment should not diminish its severity.\"\n\nBut according to the judges, the caretaker did not linger. He groped the teenager only briefly, performing an \"awkward manoeuvre without lust\".\n\n\"The judges ruled that he was joking? Well, it was no joke to me,\" the student told Corriere della Sera newspaper.\n\n\"The caretaker came up from behind without saying anything. He put his hands down my trousers and inside my underwear.\n\n\"He groped my bottom. Then, he pulled me up - hurting my private parts. For me, this is not a joke. This is not how an old man should 'joke' with a teenager.\"\n\n\"That handful of seconds was more than enough for the caretaker to make me feel his hands on me.\"\n\nShe says she feels doubly betrayed - by her school and by the justice system.\n\n\"I'm starting to think I was wrong to trust the institutions. This is not justice.\"\n\nThe student fears the judges' ruling will deter girls and women from coming forward if they are subjected to such attacks.\n\nRecent figures from the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) suggested that 70% of Italian woman who had suffered harassment between 2016 and 2021 did not report the incident.\n\n\"They will feel that reporting abuse is just not worth it.

One of the seven aid workers killed was a Polish national.\n\nThe deaths have contributed to growing international anger at how Israel is conducting the war, which has led to calls for countries to stop supplying Israel with weapons in recent days.\n\nOn Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington's ongoing support was contingent on more aid being allowed into Gaza and additional measures being introduced to protect aid workers.\n\nIsrael later said it had approved the opening of two routes into Gaza for humanitarian deliveries. It is not clear when these would be opened or under what conditions.\n\nThe Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be reopened for the first time since the start of the war, and the Israeli container port of Ashdod - which is close to Gaza - will accept humanitarian supplies.

Israel is widely believed to be behind the strike.\n\nIsrael has taken steps to prepare for a potential Iranian response, including blocking GPS in much of the country in an effort to hinder guided missiles and drones.\n\nOn Friday, Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah said: \"The Iranian response is coming without a doubt.\"\n\nMuch of the Gaza Strip has been devastated during the Israeli military operations that began after Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages.\n\nMore than 33,091 people have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.", "Ukraine has recently launched an offensive to reclaim territory seized by Russia\n\nThe war in Ukraine must end, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has told Russia's leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nMr Ramaphosa's remarks came as he met Mr Putin in St Petersburg on Saturday as part of a peace mission with six other African countries.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the delegation on Friday that he would not enter talks with Russia while they occupied Ukrainian land.\n\nMr Putin told the African leaders Ukraine had always refused talks.\n\nAt the meeting in St Petersburg, Mr Ramaphosa also called for both parties to return their prisoners of war, and said children removed by Russia should be returned home.\n\nMr Putin has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court over the forced removal of hundreds of Ukrainian children from their families during Russia's occupation of Ukraine.\n\nAs the African delegation called for the return of children to their families, Mr Putin interrupted their speech and claimed Russia was protecting them.\n\n\"Children are sacred. We moved them out of the conflict zone, saving their lives and health\", he said. The UN said they have evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nMr Ramaphosa also warned Mr Putin of the impacts of the war on Africa, and said it should be settled by diplomacy.\n\n\"The war cannot go on forever. All wars have to be settled and come to an end at some stage,\" he said. \"And we are here to communicate a very clear message that we would like this war to be ended.\"\n\nThe war has severely restricted the export of grain from Ukraine and fertiliser from Russia, which has affected African countries in particular and intensified global food insecurity.\n\nBut Mr Putin blamed the West for the grain crisis - not the war in Ukraine - as he said only 3% of the grain exports permitted under a UN-sponsored deal to ensure its safe passage through the Black Sea had gone to the world's poorest countries.\n\nRussia has repeatedly complained that Western sanctions are restricting its own agricultural exports. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were \"no grounds for extending\" the grain deal, because \"so far what we were promised has not been done\".\n\nMr Putin praised what he described as Africa's balanced position on the war, which Russia continues to call a \"special military operation\".\n\nThe African delegation, made up of representatives from South Africa, Egypt, Senegal, Congo-Brazzaville, Comoros, Zambia, and Uganda has been specifically designed for breadth and balance, with members from different parts of Africa with different views on the conflict.\n\nSouth Africa and Uganda are seen as leaning towards Russia, while Zambia and Comoros are closer to the West. Egypt, Senegal and Congo-Brazzaville have remained largely neutral.\n\nAfrican countries have primarily seen the conflict a confrontation between Russia and the West.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'The road to peace is not an easy one,' said President Cyril Ramaphosa in Ukraine\n\nThe delegation also met with Ukrainian leaders on Friday, where Mr Ramaphosa warned the war in Europe was affecting between 1.2 and 1.3 billion people in Africa.\n\nAfter the leaders landed, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, which Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said demonstrated that Mr Putin wanted \"more war\".\n\nDuring their meeting, Mr Zelensky told the delegation that \"an important result of your mission\" would be to intercede to bring about the release political prisoners held by Russia.\n\nThe meeting comes amid heightened tensions between both Russia and Ukraine, as Ukraine launches its counteroffensive near the region of Bakhmut.\n\nRussia has claimed the counteroffensive has failed, but Kyiv said it has retaken about 100 sq km of territory on its southern front.", "The long-anticipated report by MPs into whether Boris Johnson misled Parliament over Covid lockdown parties in No 10 is finally out.\n\nThe report by the seven-member privileges committee followed a year-long investigation and runs to 106 pages.\n\nThe former prime minister stood down as an MP last week after receiving an advance copy, angrily accusing the committee of bias.\n\nHere are the key findings.\n\nThe main finding is that he deliberately misled the House of Commons by repeatedly telling it, after the Partygate scandal emerged, that Covid rules had been followed at all times in Downing Street.\n\nHe has already admitted MPs were misled by his original statements, but he says he believed them to be true at the time, and they were based on assurances he had received from officials.\n\nHowever, the report found he had \"personal knowledge\" of breaches of the rules and guidance in No 10.\n\nAnd it added he failed to proactively seek out \"authoritative\" assurances about compliance, which it said amounted to a \"deliberate closing of his mind\".\n\nIt concluded it was \"highly unlikely\" he had really believed the assurances he gave at the time, \"still less that he could continue to believe them to this day\".\n\nThe report therefore concluded he had committed a \"contempt\" of Parliament through his original reassurances, because they stopped MPs from carrying out their \"essential task\" of holding him to account.\n\nThey found that he had also committed a contempt by:\n\nThe committee found that the contempt was \"all the more serious\" because he was the most senior member of the government.\n\nOne key bit of evidence came from Martin Reynolds, his former principal private secretary, a civil servant.\n\nHe told the inquiry that, while preparing for a session of Prime Minister's Questions in December 2021, he had questioned whether it was \"realistic\" for Mr Johnson to say rules had always been followed.\n\nMr Johnson also said he'd been given assurances by his media advisers that rules were followed.\n\nBut the committee said this advice, given in response to press stories, should not have been used to make broad statements about rules being followed at all times.\n\nThe report said he should have obtained an \"authoritative assessment\" before saying this, for example by consulting government lawyers.\n\nThe committee also published new evidence, including a statement from an unnamed No 10 official that there was a \"wider culture of not adhering to any rules\" in the building.\n\nThe official added that birthday parties, leaving parties and end of week gatherings \"all continued as normal\" during the pandemic.\n\nThe committee said before Mr Johnson announced he was quitting as an MP, it had wanted to recommend suspending him from for more than 10 days.\n\nThis would have meant he would potentially have faced a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.\n\nThe report also revealed two of the committee's MPs, the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue, wanted to expel him from the Commons - but were outvoted.\n\nExpulsion is extremely rare in Parliament's history, having occurred only three times in the last hundred years or so.\n\nBut suspending him is no longer an option, given that he's already stood down as an MP in his blistering resignation statement last week.\n\nHowever, the report says that now, given what he's said about the committee, they would have recommended a ban of 90 days - an extremely long ban by the standards of recent years.\n\nAnd it says he should not get a parliamentary pass, which former MPs would normally be able to apply for.\n\nPerhaps the greatest punishment in the report, ultimately, will be the damage it does to his reputation among Conservative MPs - and what it means for his prospects of any future political comeback.", "Prince Harry is one of four people taking action against the newspaper publisher\n\nPrince Harry and other celebrity claimants are a \"long way off\" proving Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) unlawfully gathered information on them, the publisher has told a court.\n\nHarry is among high-profile figures accusing MGN of various illicit practices including phone hacking.\n\nAndrew Green KC, representing MGN, said the evidence was \"slim\" in some areas and \"utterly non-existent\" in others.\n\nHe spoke on day three of a highly anticipated hearing at the High Court.\n\nMGN, which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People newspapers, vehemently denies the allegations.\n\nDuring Friday's proceedings, Mr Green said the claims had been made with \"no basis\" and \"a sense of outrage\".\n\n\"The evidence in this case is slim in relation to one of the claimants and utterly non-existent for the other three,\" he told the court.\n\nHe also took aim at the newspaper articles that had been submitted as evidence, saying they offered a \"breathtaking level of triviality\".\n\nSome 207 stories, published between 1991 and 2011, make up the bulk of the case's evidence. More than 60% of them are about Harry, Duke of Sussex.\n\nAs well as intercepting voicemails, the claimants have accused the publisher of using private investigators to illegally gather details about them to write stories.\n\nDavid Sherborne, the lawyer representing the claimants, told the court that the board knew about the hacking and covered it up.\n\nIn response, MGN said the claimants were \"smearing\" executives, adding that there had been \"extreme allegations of dishonesty\".\n\nHarry is among four people whose claims are being heard in the trial as \"representative\" cases of the types of allegations facing the publisher. They will also help the court set the level of damages MGN should pay if the claimants win.\n\nOthers involved are Coronation Street actors Nikki Sanderson and Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife Fiona Wightman.\n\nMichael Le Vell was pictured arriving at court on the first day of the trial\n\nThe publisher's lawyer argued that Ms Sanderson and Ms Wightman have run out of time to sue for damages, because these types of claims should be brought within six years of the alleged victim knowing what happened.\n\nThe Mirror Group's lawyer said phone hacking has been talked about for at least 20 years, with the publisher publicly apologising for its part in the high-profile scandal in 2014.\n\nTherefore, he argued, any potential victims should have known long ago to get a case started.\n\nBut Mr Sherborne said the claimants would not have suspected they too were victims because MGN covered up their wrongdoings so well and for so long.\n\nMr Green compared this current case to the one in 2015, where MGN conceded that unlawful techniques were used to obtain private information, and was ordered to pay \u00a31.25m in damages.\n\nBut he said this case is different, because back then, there was \"direct evidence\" from Dan Evans, a former Sunday Mirror journalist.\n\nMr Evans \"has not said he hacked any of (the claimants)\" this time around, Mr Green said.\n\nDepending on the outcome of this case, the court could then consider cases from a range of celebrities including former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl and former Arsenal and England footballer Ian Wright.\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, Mr Sherborne told the court that one of the most \"serious and troubling\" features of the case included \"the systemic and widespread use of PIs (private investigators) by MGN journalists to unlawfully obtain private information\" of various individuals.\n\nHe referred the court to key senior MGN figures who he claimed \"authorised\" the unlawful obtaining of information.\n\nHe said this included former editors Piers Morgan, Neil Wallis, Tina Weaver, Mark Thomas, Richard Wallace and Bridget Rowe, and alleged that managing editors and senior executives also knew.\n\n\"Mr Morgan was right at the heart of this in many ways,\" Mr Sherborne told the court.\n\nMr Morgan, who edited the Mirror from 1995 until 2004, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of unlawful information gathering happening under his watch - in particular phone hacking.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to run for seven weeks, will continue on Monday, when Mr Evans will testify.", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Johnson's comments in the Commons on Partygate scandal\n\nBoris Johnson has accepted he misled Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, but denied he did it on purpose.\n\nThe former prime minister has published a 52-page defence of his actions ahead of a grilling by MPs on Wednesday.\n\nIn it, he says his assurances to MPs that lockdown rules had been followed were made in \"good faith\".\n\nMr Johnson faces being suspended or even expelled from Parliament, if MPs decide he deliberately misled them.\n\nA group representing families of Covid victims said his claim to have acted in good faith was \"sickening\", and it was \"obvious\" he deliberately misled MPs.\n\nSince April last year, the Commons Privileges Committee has been investigating whether Mr Johnson initially misled Parliament over what he knew about parties in No 10 during lockdown.\n\nAfter media stories about what would become known as the Partygate scandal emerged in late 2021, Mr Johnson denied to MPs that Covid rules banning socialising indoors had been broken.\n\nBut an inquiry by senior official Sue Gray later found rule-breaking had taken place across multiple events, and police issued fines to 83 people, including Mr Johnson himself, for breaching Covid laws.\n\nThe committee, chaired by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, but with a Tory majority, has previously said Mr Johnson may have misled Parliament on multiple occasions, and evidence suggests rule breaches would have been \"obvious\" to him at the time.\n\nIn his defence document, prepared by his taxpayer-funded legal team, headed by top barrister Lord Pannick KC, Mr Johnson says he had not \"intentionally or recklessly\" misled MPs, and would \"never have dreamed of doing so\".\n\nHe said he believed at the time that events he attended in No 10, including to bid farewell to departing staff, abided by restrictions because they were \"essential for work purposes\".\n\nHe added that it \"remains unclear to me\" why he was fined for attending a gathering in No 10 for his birthday in June 2020.\n\nMr Johnson said he relied on officials to advise him about other events in the building he did not attend, and they did not tell him rules were broken.\n\nHe said that he had \"corrected the record\" in May 2022, on the day Ms Gray's report was published. On that day, he told MPs it was \"not the case\" that rules had always been followed.\n\n\"I believed - and I still believe - that this was the earliest opportunity at which I could make the necessary correction,\" he added.\n\n\"It was not fair or appropriate to give a half-baked account, before the facts had been fully and properly established.\"\n\nBoris Johnson was fined for attending a birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in 2020\n\nThe committee is expected to publish its verdict on Mr Johnson by the summer.\n\nIt has assembled evidence including written statements from 23 witnesses, official diaries, emails between officials, and WhatsApp messages handed over by the former prime minister's legal team.\n\nIt will publish a \"core bundle\" of documents on Wednesday morning, ahead of Mr Johnson's hearing later in the day.\n\nIn his defence document, Mr Johnson claimed the committee had not found evidence he intentionally misled MPs.\n\nHe said the \"only exception\" were assertions made by his former top aide Dominic Cummings, whom he said was \"discredited\" and was motivated by personal animosity.\n\nMr Cummings hit back on Twitter, saying a drinks party in the No 10 garden attended by Mr Johnson had been deemed to have broken the rules by police, with officials fined for attending.\n\nThe committee has published photos of Boris Johnson attending events - including this one in January 2021\n\nIn an interim report published earlier this month, the committee said Mr Johnson's statements to MPs, as well as his performance at Covid press conferences, show that he understood what the rules were.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the committee said Mr Johnson's written submission contained \"no new documentary evidence\".\n\nIn his document, Mr Johnson attacked the conduct of the inquiry, accusing the committee of being \"highly partisan\" and going against precedents set by previous similar inquiries.\n\nThe committee has decided that whether he intended to mislead MPs is not relevant to what it has been charged with investigating: whether it was stopped from doing its job by his statements to MPs.\n\nBut if they find that it was, then his intentions will be considered when deciding any punishment they recommend.\n\nA finding that he deliberately misled MPs is likely to attract the strongest sanction. Another option is they conclude he misled Parliament \"recklessly\".\n\nIn his submission, the former prime minister hit out at this reasoning, saying the idea of misleading MPs recklessly was an \"entirely novel concept\".\n\nThe full House of Commons will have to approve the committee's final recommendations, as well as any sanctions. Conservative MPs will be given a free vote, meaning they will not be told how to vote by party managers.\n\nThe possible punishments range from ordering him to apologise to suspending him from the Commons.\n\nIf he is suspended for more than 10 days, this could trigger a by-election in his constituency - although suspensions of this length have been rare in the past.", "Last updated on .From the section Sport\n\nAfter the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson entered the debate on transgender women's inclusion in female sport, BBC Sport breaks down some of the key questions.\n\nWhat is the debate about?\n\nThe heart of the debate on whether transgender women athletes should compete in women's sport involves the complex balance of inclusion, sporting fairness and safety.\n\nTrans women have to adhere to a number of rules to compete in specific sports, including in many cases lowering their testosterone levels to a certain amount, for a set period of time, prior to competing.\n\nThere are concerns, however, that athletes retain a biological advantage from going through male puberty that is not addressed by lowering testosterone.\n\nSports - at both elite and non-elite level - have been encouraged to come up with their own policies.\n\u2022 None 'Transgender inclusion, fairness and safety often cannot co-exist' says major review\n\nWhy is it being discussed now?\n\nTransgender cyclist Emily Bridges was due to compete in her first women's event last month, but was barred by cycling's world governing body.\n\nBridges, 21, came out as transgender in 2020 and began hormone therapy a year later as part of her gender dysphoria treatment.\n\nShe raced in male events while transitioning, including finishing 43rd out of 45 riders in the elite men's criterium at the Loughborough Cycling Festival in May 2021, while in September she was second to last in the Welsh National Championship road race, a 12km lap behind the winner.\n\nLast month, Bridges won a men's points race at the British Universities Championships in Glasgow - her final men's race.\n\nThen, having met British Cycling's requirements, Bridges was set to compete in the women's National Omnium Championships.\n\nBut three days before she was due to take part in her first women's race, Bridges was ruled ineligible to compete by cycling's world governing body, the UCI. British Cycling later suspended its transgender policy, meaning transgender women could no longer compete at its elite female events while a full review is undertaken \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nLast month, American Lia Thomas became the first known transgender swimmer to win the highest US national college title with victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle - prompting more discussion and debate across sport.\n\u2022 None Emily Bridges: UK Sport chief has 'huge empathy' for transgender cyclist and her competitors\n\nWhat are the current rules?\n\nThe rules around transgender women competing in elite sport vary depending on the sport in question.\n\nThey focus on testosterone levels in athletes, with most rules stating that transgender women have to lower and then maintain those levels in their body.\n\nFor example, World Athletics , which governs track and field events, has set five nanomoles of testosterone per litre as its benchmark.\n\nBritish Cycling, before suspending its policy, had ruled that athletes should have below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition, a level which is maintained from then on.\n\nWorld Rugby has banned trans women from playing at elite level - saying \"safety and fairness cannot presently be assured\" - while the Rugby Football Union's domestic policy in England does allow trans women to play, under certain testosterone-based conditions.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) first permitted transgender athletes to take part in the Olympics in 2004 - as long as they had undergone \"appropriate surgery\".\n\nThen in 2015 the IOC stated athletes who had transitioned from male to female could compete in women's sport without requiring surgery, as long as they have declared their gender identity is female for at least four years, and kept their testosterone level below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months.\n\nA revised framework was issued after last year's Tokyo Olympics which said there should be no assumption that a transgender athlete automatically had an unfair advantage in female events.\n\nIt said that the individual sports which come under its umbrella needed to set their own guidelines.\n\nThe updated guidance was criticised by a group of medical experts in January, who said it could undermine integrity in sport.\n\nAccording to NHS data , men's testosterone levels range between 10 and 30 nanomoles per litre dependant on factors including age and time of day.\n\nWomen have lower levels of testosterone, with one NHS Foundation Trust giving a reference range of between 0.7 and 2.8.\n\nWhat does the most recent research say?\n\nThere is limited research into what effect transitioning can have on an athlete - because there are so few transgender athletes, and even fewer in elite sport.\n\nThe NHS states that hormone therapy - such as taking oestrogen to suppress testosterone - is \"limited by factors unique to the individual, such as genetic factors\".\n\nAn 18-month review developed by Sport England, Sport Scotland, Sport Northern Ireland, Sport Wales and UK Sport concluded that \"testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports\".\n\nThe report also said that there are \"retained differences in strength, stamina and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth\".\n\nTheir guidance applies to transgender inclusion in community sport up to national level - not international, professional or elite sport, and said that 'open' or 'universal' categories may be needed in future to improve transgender inclusion.\n\nIt said existing policies were not fit for purpose, needed a reset and that \"for many sports, the inclusion of transgender people, fairness and safety cannot co-exist in a single competitive model\".\n\nJoanna Harper, a scientist at Loughborough University and a trans athlete herself, has been carrying out two studies on the impact of transitioning on athletes which has not yet been published.\n\nShe said: \"The data that I have seen suggests that there is a substantial performance loss with testosterone suppression.\n\n\"I think that in most sports, probably including cycling, that will be sufficient not to eliminate all the advantages, but to ensure meaningful competition.\"\n\nBridges told Cycling Weekly in March that she had been participating in a study at Loughborough University to track her power data. She said the data showed a 13-16% drop in her power outputs across six-second, one-minute, five-minute and 20-minute durations.\n\nAn earlier study by Harper found that hormone treatment also reduced haemoglobin levels to that of women.\n\nHaemoglobin is found in red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body and to the muscles. The NHS says women usually have a lower red blood cell count than men.\n\n\"All of the transwomen athletes that I have data on have testosterone within the typical female ranges, which are well below any limit set by a sports governing body,\" Harper added.\n\n\"And this is because transwomen don't transition for sport; we transition to be more like other women and the primary therapy to do that is to bring our hormone levels to the same values as other women.\"\n\u2022 None Should trans athletes be allowed in sport? - Listen to the full conversation\n\nA 2020 study looked at people who transitioned while serving in the US military.\n\nThe research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , found trans women who underwent hormone therapy for one year continued to keep an athletic advantage. One finding was that after two years the gap did close, but trans women ran 12% faster than the other women in the study.\n\nDr Timothy Roberts, a paediatrician and associate professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City who carried out the research, said this was slower than they would have to run in order to be an elite runner.\n\nHe told German broadcaster dw.com : \"To be in the top 10% of female runners, you have to be 29% faster than the average woman. And to be an elite runner, you've got to be 59% faster.\"\n\nSports scientist Professor Ross Tucker told BBC Sport in August how the physiological differences established during puberty can create \"significant performance advantages [between men and women]\".\n\n\"When human males go through puberty\u2026 the heart becomes larger, the lungs become larger, the body fat percentage goes down, and the skeleton changes,\" he said.\n\n\"The collection of those things creates significant performance advantages [between men and women]. Those differences are between 10-12% in swimming and cycling.\n\n\"Then you get to sports like weightlifting, which involve upper body muscle strength, where the differences are even bigger. We're talking 30-40%.\"\n\nWhat are the legal provisions and human rights issues?\n\nBridges said in a statement on social media that she simply wished to race competitively again, adding: \"No-one should have to choose between being who they are and participating in the sport that they love.\"\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in the workplace and wider society.\n\nThere are exceptions within the Act when it comes to sport. Those exceptions can also apply to services such as bathrooms and domestic abuse refuges in certain circumstances.\n\nSection 195 of the Act, which deals with sport, says it is lawful to restrict the participation of transgender people from sporting competitions where physical strength, stamina or physique are important factors in deciding who wins.\n\nHowever, the restriction can only be done to ensure the competition is fair or the other competitors are safe.\n\nEssentially that means it would not be unlawful discrimination to refuse participation to a transgender athlete if the competition organisers can show they would have an unfair competitive advantage.\n\nCycling's world governing body, the UCI, requires riders to have had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per litre for a 12-month period prior to competition.\n\nHowever, those same regulations state that the UCI must establish conditions that \"protect health and safety\" and \"guarantee fair and meaningful competition that displays and rewards the fundamental values and meaning of the sport\".\n\nWhat have the athletes at the centre of these stories said?\n\nA number of transgender women have spoken in detail about the debate and what it means to them to compete in women's events.\n\nBridges is still registered as male on British Cycling's website and raced in men's events until February as she underwent treatment to meet the requirements.\n\n\"After starting hormone therapy I didn't want to race in the male category any more than I had to - obviously, it sucks, getting dropped, racing as a man when you're not one,\" she told Cycling Weekly .\n\n\"It was quickly apparent that that was the wrong category for me.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old said she had received \"little clarity\" on why she was deemed ineligible to compete and described how she had received \"targeted abuse\" on social media.\n\nSwimmer Thomas became the first known transgender swimmer to win the highest US national college title with victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle in March.\n\nThomas swam for the Pennsylvanian men's team for three seasons before starting hormone replacement therapy in spring 2019.\n\nShe told ESPN that it \"means the world to be here\" following her victory at the college event.\n\nNew Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard was hesitant to speak to reporters before the Tokyo Olympics last year.\n\nBut she said in 2017 she hoped people would accept her competing in women's events.\n\n\"People believe what they believe when they are shown something that may be new and different to what they know. It's instinctive to be defensive,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not really my job to change what they think, what they feel and what they believe. I just hope they look at the bigger picture, rather than just trusting whatever their gut may have told them.\"\n\nWhat about their competitors and peers?\n\nA number of former and current athletes have spoken about the issue and how it impacts them.\n\nFormer swimmer Sharron Davies has said \"no rules can reverse the advantage of male puberty\" and told the BBC in 2019 that the \"potential benefit\" of a performance gap could not be ignored.\n\nBritish 800m athlete Ellie Baker tweeted about Bridges competing: \"How this has been allowed to happen is just ridiculous. I would refuse to race and hope that the other women would stand with me on this too.\n\n\"This is totally unfair. The advantages a trans women [sic] has had from going through puberty as a boy to a man can never been undone.\"\n\nShe was supported by fellow Great Britain runners Seren Bundy-Davies and Emily Diamond.\n\nBritain's 400m hurdler Jessie Knight also praised Baker for \"speaking out, something most female athletes (including myself) are not brave enough to do\".\n\nBBC Sport understands discussions were taking place among British cyclists about taking action against Bridges' inclusion in the British Omnium Championships prior to her being ruled out, but they feared voicing their opinions would be interpreted as transphobic.\n\nThis stance was largely confirmed in a letter sent to the UCI by a group of elite female cyclists on 6 April.\n\nThe group - including retired Olympians, scientists and researchers - called on cycling's world governing body to \"rescind\" its rules around transgender participation and testosterone levels and implement eligibility criteria for women \"based on female biological characteristics\".\n\nOne of the signatories was Sara Symington, head of Olympic and Paralympic programmes at British Cycling.\n\nFormer marathon runner Paula Radcliffe believes the best place to start is \"more research\" with \"honesty on both sides\".\n\n\"If you have gone through male puberty there is an undeniable advantage and the cases going on at the moment undoubtedly prove that,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think there should be an outright ban from the start, but I do think that the current IOC rules, where there should be no presumption of physical advantage, are completely wrong.\"\n\nUS swimmer Erica Sullivan, who competed against Thomas at the college event, said that Thomas deserved \"to be celebrated for her hard-won success\".\n\n\"Like anyone else in this sport, Lia has trained diligently to get to where she is and has followed all of the rules and guidelines put before her,\" Sullivan wrote for Newsweek.\n\n\"As a woman in sports, I can tell you that I know what the real threats to women's sports are: sexual abuse and harassment, unequal pay and resources and a lack of women in leadership.\"\n\nKent cricketer Maxine Blythin also received support on social media from her team-mates after she was criticised on social media.\n\nWhat have sport chiefs said?\n\nBritish Cycling performance director Stephen Park said the inclusion of transgender athletes was the \"single biggest issue for Olympic sport\".\n\nWorld Athletics president Lord Sebastian Coe, speaking in the aftermath of Thomas' victory, said the future of women's sport was \"very fragile\".\n\n\"There is no question to me that testosterone is the key determinant in performance,\" Coe told The Times.\n\n\"Look at the nature of 12 or 13-year-old girls. I remember my daughters would regularly outrun male counterparts in their class but as soon as puberty kicks in that gap opens and it remains. Gender cannot trump biology.\n\n\"I think that the integrity of women's sport if we don't get this right, and actually the future of women's sport, is very fragile.\"\n\nUCI president David Lappartient told BBC Sport he was \"worried\" the inclusion of transgender athletes could affect the fairness of competition in cycling.\n\nHowever, he added that the UCI \"fully recognises the rights of transgender athletes to do sport\".\n\nWorld Rugby, when it banned transgender athletes, said: \"It is known that biological males (whose puberty and development is influenced by androgens/testosterone) are stronger by 25% to 50%, are 30% more powerful, 40% heavier, and about 15% faster than biological females.\n\n\"That combination of mass, strength, power and speed means that in a direct physical contest, ciswomen in all these domains will be at significant risk of injury.\"\n\nMore reading from BBC Sport on this issue\n\u2022 None 'Transgender inclusion, fairness and safety often cannot co-exist' says major review\n\u2022 None Thomas becomes first known transgender athlete to win NCAA swimming title\n\u2022 None Bridges will not race in women's National Omnium event\n\u2022 None UCI can ban Bridges even if she meets eligibility criteria\n\u2022 None Prime Minister Boris Johnson says transgender women should not compete in women's sport\n\u2022 None UK Sport chief has 'huge empathy' for transgender cyclist and her competitors", "An area of tropical forest the size of Switzerland was lost last year as tree losses surged, according to new research.\n\nIt means that a political pledge to end deforestation made at COP26 by world leaders is well off track.\n\nSome 11 football pitches of forest were lost every minute in 2022, with Brazil dominating the destruction.\n\nBut a sharp reduction in forest loss in Indonesia shows that reversing this trend is achievable.\n\nOne of the key moments at the COP26 climate meeting in 2021 saw over 100 world leaders sign the Glasgow Declaration on forests, where they committed to work collectively to \"halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030\".\n\nIn total, leaders from countries covering around 85% of global forests signed up. This included former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who had relaxed the enforcement of environmental laws to allow development in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe Glasgow pact was agreed after a previous agreement signed in 2014 failed to stem the relentless loss of trees.\n\nNow a new analysis carried out by Global Forest Watch shows that the new promise made in Glasgow is not being kept.\n\nLosses of tropical primary (old-growth) forest are seen as particularly critical for global warming and biodiversity.\n\nRainforests in Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia absorb huge amounts of greenhouse gases.\n\nClearing or burning these older forests sees that stored carbon released to the atmosphere, driving up temperatures around the world.\n\nThese forests are also critical for maintaining biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions of people.\n\nScientists warn that these functions - or \"ecosystem services\" - can't easily be replaced by planting trees elsewhere, because these forests have developed over such a long period of time.\n\nAccording to the new data, gathered by the University of Maryland, the tropics lost 10% more primary rainforest in 2022 than in 2021, with just over 4m hectares (nearly 16,000 sq miles) felled or burned in total.\n\nThis released an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of India.\n\n\"The question is, are we on track to halt deforestation by 2030? And the short answer is a simple no,\" said Rod Taylor from the World Resources Institute (WRI) which runs the Global Forest Watch.\n\nPresident Lula and his environment minister have promised to end deforestation in Brazil\n\n\"Globally, we are far off track and trending in the wrong direction. Our analysis shows that global deforestation in 2022 was over 1 million hectares above the level needed to be on track to zero deforestation by 2030.\"\n\nBrazil dominates the losses of primary tropical forest and in 2022 this increased by over 14%.\n\nIn Amazonas state, which is home to over half of Brazil's intact forests, the rate of deforestation has almost doubled over the past three years.\n\nWhile the overall picture is not good, there are some positive developments that show that it is possible to rein in deforestation.\n\nIndonesia has reduced its primary tropical forest loss more than any other country in recent years since recording an all-time high in 2016.\n\nAnalysis suggests this is down to both government and corporate actions.\n\nA moratorium on logging in new palm oil plantations was made permanent in 2019, while efforts to monitor and limit fires have been stepped up.\n\nIndonesia has stepped up fire monitoring and restricted new palm plantations\n\nIt's a similar story in Malaysia. In both countries, oil palm corporations also appear to be taking action, with some 83% of palm oil refining capacity now operating under no deforestation, no peatland and no exploitation commitments.\n\nBolivia, one of the few countries not to sign the Glasgow Declaration, also saw a rapid acceleration of forest losses in 2022, up almost a third in a year.\n\nCommodity agriculture is the main driver, according to researchers. Soybean expansion has resulted in nearly a million hectares of deforestation in Bolivia since the turn of the century.\n\nAlthough Ghana in West Africa has only a small amount of primary forest remaining, it saw a massive 71% increase in losses in 2022, mostly in protected areas. Some of these losses are close to existing cocoa farms.\n\nWith a new president in Brazil committing to end deforestation in the Amazon by 2030, there is renewed hope that the promises made in Glasgow in 2021 might fare better in the coming years.\n\nBut if the world wants to keep global temperatures under the critical 1.5C threshold, the time for action on forests is very short indeed, say the researchers.\n\n\"There's an urgency to get a peak and decline in deforestation, even more urgent than the peak and decline in carbon emissions,\" said Rod Taylor from WRI.\n\n\"Because once you lose forests, they're just so much harder to recover. They're kind of irrecoverable assets.\"\n\nThe loss of tree cover can be monitored relatively easily by analysing satellite images - although there's sometimes uncertainty about the precise year in which trees have been lost.\n\nMeasuring deforestation - which typically refers to human-caused, permanent removal of natural forest cover - is more complicated, because not all tree-cover loss counts as deforestation.\n\nFor example, losses from fire, disease or storms, as well as losses within sustainable production forests, would not usually count as deforestation. There are difficulties with this - for instance, some fires may have been started deliberately to clear a forest, rather than being natural.\n\nScientists try to take all of these factors into account to come up with an estimate for deforestation.\n\nThe latest figures suggests a rise in (human-caused) global deforestation of about 3.6% in 2022 compared with 2021 - the opposite direction to what was pledged in Glasgow.\n\nInterestingly, whilst losses of the particularly important primary tropical forests rose by nearly 10% in 2022, overall global tree cover loss from all causes actually fell by nearly 10%.\n\nBut researchers say this was because losses from forest fires were down in 2022, particularly in Russia. This is not thought to be part of a long-term trend.\n\nIn fact, tree cover losses from fires have generally increased in the last two decades, and fires are expected to become more common in future due to climate change and alterations to the way land is used.\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.", "Coverage: Follow live text & radio coverage on the BBC Sport website & app; watch highlights on Sportscene\n\nKyogo Furuhashi doesn't need to don the cloak and scythe of the grim reaper when he fetches up at Ibrox on Sunday. The bare numbers of his story versus Rangers reveal how much of a bogey man he's been to the Ibrox club.\n\nIn the December meeting at Celtic Park, Kyogo had two shots on target and scored with one of them, which turned out to be the decisive goal.\n\nIn September at Ibrox, he had just nine touches of the ball in 76 minutes, one of them being the match-winner.\n\nLast April, in a 3-2 win, he had two shots on target and two goals from only 17 touches.\n\nA few months earlier, just when it looked like Rangers were going to win 2-1 at Ibrox, Kyogo poked in the equaliser with two minutes left. It was his only attempt on target. He had 15 touches and was largely anonymous, until he wasn't.\n\nThis time last year he was on 26 goals. Now he's on 16.\n\u2022 None Rodgers has no issue with 'top referee' Beaton\n\u2022 None What do the numbers tell us about derby?\n\nHe's had those Old Firm highs, but it's not been a vintage season for Kyogo. He's missed the service of Jota on one side and Liel Abada on the other, the holy trinity of the Ange Postecoglou years.\n\nHe's playing deeper under Rodgers and has suffered from the musical chairs on either side of him, the constant changing of the wide players and the lack of fluency it has brought at times. Some of that has been down to injury.\n\nHe'll still occupy the every waking thought of the Rangers defence in the build-up to Sunday.\n\nThey all know about his stealth, they've all been burned by his capacity to appear under the thumb for large parts of a game before, metaphorically, breaking free and thumping them in the face. In Kyogo, Celtic will continue to trust.\n\nIf Kyogo has inflicted pain on Rangers, then Brendan Rodgers has really been torturer-in-chief.\n\nFifteen games with 12 victories and only one defeat. A 4-0, a 5-0 and a 5-1. A total of 34 goals scored and only eight conceded. 1,350 minutes played and behind for only 108 of those. Eight clean sheets to Rangers' two.\n\nEven when his team have looked shaky, they've still done the job.\n\nGoing into the first meeting of the season, Celtic had drawn with St Johnstone and had lost to Kilmarnock in their previous two games. Rangers smelt blood at Ibrox that day. Celtic won 1-0.\n\nEarlier in December, they lost to Kilmarnock and Hearts before facing Rangers. Philippe Clement's side had gone unbeaten in 16 matches, winning 13, one of which was away to Real Betis in the Europa League. A Betis team who five days before had drawn 1-1 with the Real Madrid of Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Federico Valverde.\n\n'It wasn't supposed to be like this for prodigal son'\n\nRodgers' dominance has entered the history books. With an 80% win rate, he has the highest win return of any Old Firm manager in major competitions.\n\nDoubt from the outside world accompanied all the way to kick-off in both of his games against Rangers this season but Rodgers - and Kyogo - came up with the solutions. But there's doubt again now.\n\nThis season has not been the Celtic procession that some might have thought it was going to be. Rangers have got their act together while Celtic have bobbed along on choppy waters.\n\nA poor summer transfer window followed by a poor January transfer window. The sound of booing at Celtic Park. The sound of Rodgers having a go at those booing. The endless grief with the Green Brigade. The \"good girl\" saga that saw Rodgers slammed by a women's campaigning group. The Scottish FA charge - and subsequent touchline ban - for accusing officials of incompetence.\n\nIt's been a grind. Five draws and three defeats. Ninetieth-minute wins against Hibs and Motherwell twice. It wasn't supposed to be like this for the prodigal son.\n\nAnd yet, they're still top of the league, albeit with Rangers having a game in hand.\n\nThey've scored more goals than their city rivals, have a higher expected goals count and have created more big chances.\n\nThey've not been fluent nearly as often as Rodgers would have liked - he's had some harsh words to say about their negativity and their lack of speed of thought and movement along the way - but they're still there.\n\nAnd if they win, or even draw, on Sunday you'd make them favourites to win the title because they'll have Rangers at Celtic Park post-split, a Celtic Park that will be heaving to the sound of 60,000 fans getting on the backs of visiting players, many of whom have never closed a deal as big as this one.\n\nRangers will be encouraged by Callum McGregor's absence since the end of February and hopeful that, even if he is ready to play, then he won't be at his totemic best.\n\nFor Rodgers, it's bigger this time. He has never faced this kind of game in Scotland before, a game that if lost could - and most probably would - cost him the title.\n\nThat's alien territory for the Celtic manager. In his previous incarnation they'd have been organising the party by now.\n\nIt's what makes Sunday so intoxicating. Rodgers, and how he will be viewed by Celtic fans in victory or in defeat, is a drama unto itself. Given their complicated feelings about him, it's a love-in or a pile-on balanced on a knife edge.\n\nAll 15 of his Old Firm games have been important, but this one holds more peril than any of the others.\n\nHave your say on Rodgers & Celtic\n\nIf the form doesn't load properly, go straight to it here...\n\u2022 Celtic is bigger and better than ever before - here's everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment\n\u2022 None Everything Celtic - go straight to all the best content", "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nMartin Lewis said he was left feeling \"sick\" by an online scam video featuring a realistic computer-generated likeness of him.\n\nThe widely-circulated ad, which attempts to solicit money for a supposed investment scheme, appears to use AI-powered deepfake technology.\n\nConsumer finance expert Lewis said it was \"weird and pretty frightening\" to have his face and voice imitated.\n\nHe warned people would be tricked out of money without industry regulation.\n\nIn the advert - which appeared on Facebook - a fake likeness of Lewis encourages people to sign up for what is claimed to be an Elon Musk-backed project, calling it \"legit\" and a \"great investment\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lewis said: \"My name and face have been the subject of scam adverts for many years, I get countless reports every day.\n\n\"This is the first deepfake I've seen with me in it\u2026 it's already difficult enough to persuade people [about scams].\n\n\"I've had friends of mine get in touch with me at times saying 'hey, I've just put some money in that investment scheme you're advertising'.\n\nDeepfakes are images which have been convincingly digitally manipulated.
